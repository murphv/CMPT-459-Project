(a) Represents an investment that is not a “qualifying
asset” under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act”). As of November 30, 2022, non-qualifying

assets in qualifying assets.
(b) Percentages are based on net assets of $335,763,600 as
of November 30, 2022.
(c) Because there is no “readily available market quotations”

using significant unobservable inputs and approved in good faith by our board of directors. These investments have been included as Level

on quoted prices in active markets, identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. These investments have

(d) These securities are either fully or partially pledged as collateral
under the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
(e) This investment does not have a stated interest rate that is payable
thereon. As a result, the 0.00% interest rate in the table above represents the effective interest rate currently earned on the investment
cost and is based on the current cash interest and other income generated by the investment.

(a)
Represents an investment that is not a “qualifying asset” under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act”). As of February 28, 2022, non-qualifying assets represent 6.7% of the Company’s portfolio at fair value. As a BDC, the Company generally has to invest at least 70% of its total assets in qualifying assets.
(b)
Percentages are based on net assets of $355,780,523 as of February 28, 2022.
(c)
Because there is no readily available market value for these investments, the fair values of these investments were determined using significant unobservable inputs and approved in good faith by our board of directors.  These investments have been included as Level 3 in the Fair Value Hierarchy (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
(d)
These securities are either fully or partially pledged as collateral under a senior secured revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
(e)
This investment does not have a stated interest rate
that is payable thereon. As a result, the 9.27% interest rate in the table above represents the effective interest rate currently earned
on the investment cost and is based on the current cash interest and other income generated by the investment.
(f)
As defined in the 1940 Act, this portfolio company is an “affiliate” as we own between 5.0% and 25.0% of the outstanding voting securities.

1. Organization
Saratoga
Investment Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”) is a non-diversified closed end
management investment company incorporated in Maryland that has elected to be treated and is regulated as a business development company
(“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Company commenced operations
on March 23, 2007 as GSC Investment Corp. and completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) on March 28, 2007. The Company
has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”)
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Company’s investment objective
is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from its investments.
GSC
Investment, LLC (the “LLC”) was organized in May 2006 as a Maryland limited liability company. As of February 28, 2007, the
LLC had not yet commenced its operations and investment activities.
On
March 21, 2007, the Company was incorporated and concurrently therewith the LLC was merged with and into the Company, with the Company
as the surviving entity, in accordance with the procedure for such merger in the LLC’s limited liability company agreement and
Maryland law. In connection with such merger, each outstanding limited liability company interest of the LLC was converted into a share
of common stock of the Company.
On
July 30, 2010, the Company changed its name from “GSC Investment Corp.” to “Saratoga Investment Corp.” in connection
with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction.
The
Company is externally managed and advised by the investment adviser, Saratoga Investment Advisors, LLC (the “Manager” or
“Saratoga Investment Advisors”), pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (the “Management Agreement”).
Prior to July 30, 2010, the Company was managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P.
The Company has established wholly owned subsidiaries,
SIA-ARC, Inc., SIA-Avionte, Inc., SIA-AX, Inc., SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-MAC, Inc., SIA-PP Inc., SIA-TG, Inc., SIA-TT, Inc., SIA-Vector, Inc.
and SIA-VR, Inc., which are structured as Delaware entities, or tax blockers (“Taxable Blockers”), to hold equity or equity-like
investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass through entities). In February
2022, SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-TT Inc. and SIA-VR, Inc. received an approved plan of liquidation following the sale of equity held by each of
the portfolio companies. Tax Blockers are consolidated for accounting purposes, but are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and may incur U.S. federal income tax expenses as a result of their ownership of portfolio companies.
On March 28, 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC, LP (“SBIC LP”), received a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) license
from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). On August 14, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp.
SBIC II LP (“SBIC II LP”), also received an SBIC license from the SBA. On September 29, 2022, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC III LP (“SBIC III LP”), also received an SBIC license from the SBA. SBIC LP’s license provided
up to $ 150.0
million in additional long-term capital in the form of SBA debentures, while SBIC II LP’s and SBIC III LP’s SBIC
licenses provide up to $ 175.0
million each. Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount
of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed $ 350.0
million with at least $ 175.0
million in combined regulatory capital.
26
The
Company has formed a wholly owned special purpose entity, Saratoga Investment Funding II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SIF
II”), for the purpose of entering into a $ 50.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility with Encina Lender Finance, LLC
(the “Lender”), supported by loans held by SIF II and pledged to the Lender under the credit facility (the “Encina
Credit Facility”). The Encina Credit Facility closed on October 4, 2021. During the first two years following the closing date,
SIF II may request an increase in the commitment amount under the Encina Credit Facility to up to $ 75.0
million. The terms of the Encina
Credit Facility require a minimum drawn amount of $ 12.5
million at all times during the first six months following the closing date,
which increases to the greater of $ 25.0
million or
50 % of the commitment amount in effect at any time thereafter. The term of the Encina
Credit Facility is three years. Advances under the Encina Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus
4.0 %, with LIBOR having a floor of
0.75 %, with customary provisions related to the selection by the Lender and the Company of a replacement
benchmark rate. Concurrently with the closing of the Encina Credit Facility, all remaining amounts outstanding on the Company’s
existing revolving credit facility with Madison Capital Funding, LLC were repaid and the revolving credit facility terminated.
On October 26, 2021, the Company and TJHA JV I LLC
(“TJHA”) entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) to co-manage Saratoga Senior
Loan Fund I JV LLC (“SLF JV”). SLF JV is under joint control and is not consolidated. SLF JV is invested in Saratoga Investment
Corp Senior Loan Fund 2022-1 Ltd. (“SLF 2022”), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SLF JV. SLF 2022 was formed for the
purpose of making investments in a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated first lien and second lien term loans or bonds in the primary
and secondary markets. On October 28, 2022, SLF 2022 issued $ 402.1
million of debt (the “2022 JV CLO Notes”) through a collateralized
loan obligation trust (the “JV CLO trust”). The 2022 JV CLO Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated October 28,
2022 (the “JV Indenture”), with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National
Association) (the “Trustee”) servicing as the trustee.
Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“U.S. GAAP”), are stated in U.S. Dollars and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned special purpose
financing subsidiaries, Saratoga Investment Funding, LLC (previously known as GSC Investment Funding LLC), SIF II, SBIC LP, SBIC II
LP, SIA-ARC, Inc., SIA-Avionte, Inc., SIA-AX, Inc., SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-MAC, Inc., SIA-PP, Inc., SIA-TG, Inc., SIA-TT Inc.,
SIA-Vector, Inc. and SIA-VR, Inc.. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All references
made to the “Company,” “we,” and “us” herein include Saratoga Investment Corp. and its
consolidated subsidiaries, except as stated otherwise.
The
Company, SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP are all considered to be investment companies for financial reporting purposes and have
applied the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 946, “ Financial Services — Investment Companies ” (“ASC 946”). There have been no changes to
the Company, SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, or SBIC III LP’s status as investment companies during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation
Under
the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to ASC Topic 946, the Company is precluded from consolidating any entity other
than another investment company.
The Company has determined that SLF JV is an investment
company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company
other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary. SLF JV is not a wholly owned investment company subsidiary as the Company and
TJHA each have an equal
50 % voting interest in SLF JV and thus neither party has a controlling financial interest. Furthermore, ASC 810
concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision-making authority, it is not appropriate for one member to consolidate
the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate its investment in SLF JV.
27
Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, and income, gains (losses) and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents include short-term, liquid investments in a money market fund. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which
approximates fair value. Per section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act, the Company may not invest in another investment company, such as a
money market fund, if such investment would cause the Company to exceed any of the following limitations:
●
we were to own more than
3.0 % of the investment company’s total outstanding voting shares;
●
we were to hold securities in the investment company having an aggregate value in excess of
5.0 % of the value of our total assets; or
●
we were to hold securities in investment companies having an aggregate value in excess of
10.0 % of the value of our total assets.
As
of November 30, 2022, the Company did not exceed any of these limitations.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Reserve Accounts
Cash and cash equivalents, reserve accounts include
amounts held in designated bank accounts in the form of cash and short-term liquid investments in money market funds, representing payments
received on secured investments or other reserved amounts associated with the Encina Credit Facility within SIF II, our wholly owned subsidiary.
The Company is required to use these amounts to pay interest expense, reduce borrowings, or pay other amounts in accordance with the terms
of the Encina Credit Facility.
In addition, cash and cash equivalents, reserve
accounts also include amounts held in designated bank accounts, in the form of cash and short-term liquid investments in money market
funds, within SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP, our wholly owned subsidiaries.
The
statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described
as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts.
The
following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents, reserve accounts reported within
the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements
of cash flows:

Investment
Classification
The
Company classifies its investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, “control investments”
are defined as investments in companies in which we own more than
25.0 % of the voting securities or maintain greater than
50.0 % of the
board representation. Under the 1940 Act, “affiliated investments” are defined as those non-control investments in companies
in which we own between
5.0 % and
25.0 % of the voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, “non-affiliated investments” are defined
as investments that are neither control investments nor affiliated investments.
28
Investment
Valuation
The
Company accounts for its investments at fair value in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy
based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires
the Company to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities are to be transferred at the measurement date in the principal
market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical
market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable,
and willing and able to transact.
Investments
for which market quotations are readily available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing
services and market makers subject to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant
events affecting the value of these investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value
as approved, in good faith, by our board of directors based on input from our Manager, the audit committee of our board of directors
and a third-party independent valuation firm.
The
Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available,
as described below:
●
Each investment is initially
valued by the responsible investment professionals of the Manager and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented, reviewed
and discussed with our senior management; and
●
An
independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors independently reviews a selection of these
preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes
are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year.
We use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of
Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1, Ltd. (“Saratoga CLO”), the Class F-2-R-3 Notes tranche
of the Saratoga CLO, and the Class E Notes tranche of the SLF 2022 every quarter.
In
addition, all our investments are subject to the following valuation process:
●
The audit committee of our
board of directors reviews and approves each preliminary valuation and our Manager and independent valuation firm (if applicable)
will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and
●
Our board of directors discusses
the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of our Manager, independent valuation
firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors.
We
use multiple techniques for determining fair value based on the nature of the investment and experience with those types of investments
and specific portfolio companies. The selections of the valuation techniques and the inputs and assumptions used within those techniques
often require subjective judgements and estimates. These techniques include market comparables, discounted cash flows and enterprise
value waterfalls. Fair value is best expressed as a range of values from which the Company determines a single best estimate. The types
of inputs and assumptions that may be considered in determining the range of values of our investments include the nature and realizable
value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis and volatility in future
interest rates, call and put features, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies,
discounted cash flows and other relevant factors.
29
The
Company’s investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow valuation technique that
utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss inputs based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics
of the underlying cash flow and comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO,
when available, as determined by our Manager and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flows, or an
appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO. The cash flows use a set of inputs including
projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The inputs
are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. The Company uses the output
from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine
the valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO.
The Company’s equity investment in SLF JV
is measured using the proportionate share of the net asset value (“NAV”), or equivalent, of SLF JV as a practical expedient
for fair value, provided by ASC 820.
Because such valuations, and particularly valuations
of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based
on estimates. The determination of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these
investments existed. The Company’s NAV could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments
were materially higher or lower than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments.
In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) adopted a new rule providing a framework for fund valuation practices. New Rule 2a-5 under the 1940
Act (“Rule 2a-5”) establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Rule 2a-5
will permit boards of directors, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate certain parties to perform fair
value determinations. Rule 2a-5 also defines when market quotations are “readily available” for purposes of the 1940 Act and
the threshold for determining whether a fund must determine the fair value of a security. The SEC also adopted new Rule 31a-4 under the
1940 Act (“Rule 31a-4”), which provides the recordkeeping requirements associated with fair value determinations. Finally,
the SEC is rescinding previously issued guidance on related issues, including the role of the board in determining fair value and the
accounting and auditing of fund investments. Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4 became effective on March 8, 2021, and had a compliance date of
September 8, 2022. While our board of directors has not elected to designate Saratoga Investment Advisors as the valuation designee, the
Company has adopted certain revisions to its valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule
2a-5 and Rule 31a-4.
Derivative
Financial Instruments
The
Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging
(“ASC
815”). ASC 815 requires recognizing all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of
assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company values derivative contracts at the closing fair value provided by the counterparty.
Changes in the values of derivative contracts are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Investment
Transactions and Income Recognition
Purchases
and sales of investments and the related realized gains or losses are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income, adjusted for amortization
of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The
Company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums
on investments purchased are accreted/amortized using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original
cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts over the life of the investment and amortization of premiums on investments up to the earliest
call date.
Loans
are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest
is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized
as a reduction in principal depending upon management’s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual
status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may
make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. At November 30,
2022, our investment in one portfolio company was on non-accrual status with a fair value of approximately $ 9.7  million,
or
1.0 % of the fair value of our portfolio. At February 28, 2022, there were no investments on non-accrual status.
30
Interest
income on our investment in Saratoga CLO is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic
325,
Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets , (“ASC 325”), based on the anticipated
yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or
estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield
are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was
changed.
Payment-in-Kind
Interest
The
Company holds debt and preferred equity investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provision.
The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity,
is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing PIK interest
if it is expected that the issuer will not be able to pay all principal and interest when due.
Dividend
Income
Dividend
income is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when earned.
Structuring
and Advisory Fee Income
Structuring
and advisory fee income represents various fee income earned and received for performing certain investment structuring and advisory
activities during the closing of new investments.
Other
Income
Other
income includes prepayment income fees, and monitoring, administration and amendment fees and is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations when earned.
Deferred
Debt Financing Costs
Financing
costs incurred in connection with our credit facility and notes are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the life
of the respective facility and debt securities. Financing costs incurred in connection with the SBA debentures of SBIC LP, SBIC II LP,
and SBIC III LP are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debentures. Any discount or premium on
the issuance of any debt is amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the respective debt security.
The
Company presents deferred debt financing costs on the balance sheet as a contra-liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
Realized
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Upon
the repayment of debt obligations that are deemed to be extinguishments, the difference between the principal amount due at maturity
adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs is recognized as a loss (i.e., the unamortized debt issuance costs are recognized as
a loss upon extinguishment of the underlying debt obligation).
Contingencies
In
the ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future
events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Company. Based on its history and experience, management
reasonably believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote. Therefore, the Company has not accrued any liabilities in connection
with such indemnifications.
31
In
the ordinary course of business, the Company may directly or indirectly be a defendant or plaintiff in legal actions with respect to
bankruptcy, insolvency or other types of proceedings. Such lawsuits may involve claims that could adversely affect the value of certain
financial instruments owned by the Company.
Income
Taxes
The
Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M
of the Code. By meeting these requirements, the Company will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on ordinary income or capital
gains timely distributed to stockholders. Therefore, no provision has been recorded for federal income taxes, except as related to the
Taxable Blockers and long-term capital gains, when applicable.
In
order to qualify as a RIC, among other requirements, the Company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least
90 % of
its “investment company taxable income”, as defined by the Code, for each fiscal tax year. The Company will be subject to
a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of
4 % on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least (1)
98 % of its net ordinary
income in any calendar year, (2)
98.2 % of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31 and (3) any net ordinary
income and capital gain net income that it recognized for preceding years, but were not distributed during such year, and on which the
Company paid no U.S federal income tax.
Depending
on the level of investment company taxable income earned in a tax year and the amount of net capital gains recognized in such tax year,
the Company may choose to carry forward investment company taxable income and net capital gains in excess of current year dividend distributions
into the next tax year and pay the
4.0 % U.S. federal excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines
that its estimated current year annual investment company taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions
for U.S. federal excise tax purposes, the Company accrues the U.S. federal excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as
taxable income is earned.
In
accordance with U.S. Treasury regulations and published guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), a publicly
offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as counting toward its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects
to receive his, her, or its entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC. This published guidance indicates that the rule will
apply where the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders is not at least
20.0 % of the aggregate declared distribution.
Under the published guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated
among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder,
electing to receive cash, receive less than
20.0 % of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements
are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could
have been received instead of stock.
The
Company may utilize wholly owned holding companies taxed under Subchapter C of the Code or tax blockers, when making equity investments
in portfolio companies taxed as pass-through entities to meet its source-of-income requirements as a RIC. Taxable Blockers are consolidated
in the Company’s U.S. GAAP financial statements and may result in current and deferred federal and state income tax expense with
respect to income derived from those investments. Such income, net of applicable income taxes, is not included in the Company’s
tax-basis net investment income until distributed by the Taxable Blocker, which may result in timing and character differences between
the Company’s U.S. GAAP and tax-basis net investment income and realized gains and losses. Income tax expense or benefit from Taxable
Blockers related to net investment income are included in total operating expenses, while any expense or benefit related to federal or
state income tax originated for capital gains and losses are included together with the applicable net realized or unrealized gain or
loss line item. Deferred tax assets of the Taxable Blockers are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more-likely than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
FASB
ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes,
(“ASC 740”), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not”
of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a “more-likely-than-not” threshold would
be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, the
Company did not incur any interest or penalties. Although we file federal and state tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal.
The 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 federal tax years for the Company remain subject to examination by the IRS. As of November 30, 2022 and
February 28, 2022, there were no uncertain tax positions. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible
that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months.
32
Dividends
Dividends
to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the board of directors.
Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain some or all of our
net capital gains for reinvestment.
We
have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on behalf
of our stockholders unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a
cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their cash
dividends automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends. We have the
option to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP through the issuance of new shares of common stock or through open market purchases
of common stock by the DRIP plan administrator.
Capital
Gains Incentive Fee
The
Company records an expense accrual on the consolidated statements of operations relating to the capital gains incentive fee payable by
the Company to the Manager on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities when the net realized and unrealized gain on its
investments exceed all net realized and unrealized capital losses on its investments because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed
to the Manager if the Company were to liquidate its investment portfolio at such time.
The
actual incentive fee payable to the Manager related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal
year and only reflected those net realized capital gains net of realized and unrealized losses for the period.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In
March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform
(“ASU 2020-04”). The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide
optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference
rate reform if certain criteria are met. The Company has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies
and under the Encina Credit Facility. Many of these agreements (including the credit agreements relating to the Encina Credit Facility)
include an alternative successor rate or language for choosing an alternative successor rate when LIBOR reference is no longer considered
to be appropriate. With respect to other agreements, the Company intends to work with its portfolio companies to modify agreements to
choose an alternative successor rate. Contract modifications are required to be evaluated in determining whether the modifications result
in the establishment of new contracts or the continuation of existing contracts. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through
December 31, 2022. Management does not believe this optional guidance has a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and disclosures.
Risk
Management
In
the ordinary course of its business, the Company manages a variety of risks, including market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the
risk of potential adverse changes to the value of investments because of changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements
and volatility in investment prices.
33
Credit
risk is the risk of default or non-performance by portfolio companies, equivalent to the investment’s carrying amount. The Company
is also exposed to credit risk related to maintaining all of its cash and cash equivalents, including those in reserve accounts, at a
major financial institution and credit risk related to any of its derivative counterparties.
The
Company has investments in lower rated and comparable quality unrated high yield bonds and bank loans. Investments in high yield investments
are accompanied by a greater degree of credit risk. The risk of loss due to default by the issuer is significantly greater for holders
of high yield securities, because such investments are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.
Note
3. Investments
As
noted above, the Company values all investments in accordance with ASC 820. As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants at the
measurement date.
ASC
820 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability of inputs used
in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment
and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can
be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment
used in measuring fair value.
Based
on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide disclosures on fair value measurements
according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the observability of the inputs used to determine fair values.
Investments carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
●
Level 1—Valuations based
on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
●
Level 2— Pricing inputs
are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Such
inputs may be quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full character of the financial instrument, or inputs that
are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information. Investments that are generally included in this
category include illiquid debt securities and less liquid, privately held or restricted equity securities, for which some level of
recent trading activity has been observed.
●
Level 3—Pricing inputs
are unobservable for the investment and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The
inputs may be based on the Company’s own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability or may
use Level 2 inputs, as adjusted, to reflect specific investment attributes relative to a broader market assumption. Even if observable
market data for comparable performance or valuation measures (earnings multiples, discount rates, other financial/valuation ratios,
etc.) are available, such investments are grouped as Level 3 if any significant data point that is not also market observable (private
company earnings, cash flows, etc.) is used in the valuation technique. We use multiple techniques for determining fair value based
on the nature of the investment and experience with those types of investments and specific portfolio companies. The selections of
the valuation techniques and the inputs and assumptions used within those techniques often require subjective judgements and estimates.
These techniques include market comparables, discounted cash flows and enterprise value waterfalls. Fair value is best expressed
as a range of values from which the Company determines a single best estimate. The types of inputs and assumptions that may be considered
in determining the range of values of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s
ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis and volatility in future interest rates, call and put features, the markets
in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flows and other relevant factors.
34
In
addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company continues to employ the valuation policy approved by the board
of directors that is consistent with ASC 820 and the 1940 Act (see Note 2). Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source
of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.

* The weighted average in the table above is calculated based on each investment’s fair value weighting, using the applicable unobservable input.
For
investments utilizing a market comparables valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the market yield, in isolation,
would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in any of the earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) or revenue valuation multiples, in isolation, would result in a significantly
higher (lower) fair value measurement. For investments utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease)
in the discount rate, and prepayment rate, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement while
a significant increase (decrease) in recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
For investments utilizing a third-party bid or market quote in deriving a value, a significant increase (decrease) in the third-party
bid or market quote, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

For loans and debt securities for which market quotations
are not readily available, we determine their fair value based on third party indicative broker quotes, where available, or the inputs
that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the security in a current hypothetical sale using a market comparables valuation
technique. In applying the market comparables valuation technique, we determine the fair value based on such factors as market participant
inputs including synthetic credit ratings, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities
as of the measurement date. If, in our judgment, the market comparables technique is not sufficient or appropriate, we may use additional
techniques such as an asset liquidation or expected recovery model.
For
equity securities of portfolio companies and partnership interests, we determine the fair value using an enterprise value waterfall valuation
technique. Under the enterprise value waterfall valuation technique, we determine the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company
and then waterfall the enterprise value over the portfolio company’s securities in order of their preference relative to one another.
To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, we weigh some or all of the traditional market valuation techniques and factors
based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The techniques for performing
investments may be based on, among other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable
companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering
offers from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent
investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. For non-performing investments, we may estimate the liquidation or collateral
value of the portfolio company’s assets and liabilities. We also take into account historical and anticipated financial results.
Our investments in Saratoga CLO and SLF 2022 are
carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow valuation technique that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss inputs
based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and comparable
yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO and SLF 2022, when available, as determined
by our Manager and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flows, or an appropriate substitute, to form
the basis for the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO and SLF 2022. The cash flows use a set of inputs including projected default
rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The inputs are based on available
market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. We ran Intex models based on inputs about the refinanced
Saratoga CLO’s structure and the SLF 2022 structure, including capital structure, cost of liabilities and reinvestment period. We
use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash
flows to determine a valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO and SLF 2022 at November 30, 2022. The inputs at November 30, 2022 for
the valuation model include:
●
Default rate: 2%
●
Recovery rate: 35% –
70%
●
Discount rate: 15.5% –
22%
●
Prepayment rate: 20%
●
Reinvestment rate / price:
$97.00 for eighteen months; then L+365bps / $99.00

Note
4. Investment in Saratoga CLO
On
January 22, 2008, the Company entered into a collateral management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which the Company acts as
its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016.
On November 15, 2016, the Company completed a second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October
2018.
On
December 14, 2018, the Company completed a third refinancing and upsize of the Saratoga CLO (the “2013-1 Reset CLO Notes”).
The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity
date to
January 2030 . A non-call period ending January 2020 was also added. Following this refinancing, the Saratoga CLO portfolio increased
its aggregate principal amount from approximately $ 300.0
million to approximately $ 500.0
million of predominantly senior secured first
lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, the Company invested an additional $ 13.8
million in all of the newly issued
subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased $ 2.5
million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 and $ 7.5
million
in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of 3M USD LIBOR plus
8.75 % and 3M USD LIBOR plus
10.00 %, respectively. As part of this refinancing, the Company also redeemed our existing $ 4.5
million in aggregate amount of the Class
F notes tranche at par.
On
February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd. (“CLO
2013-1 Warehouse 2”), a wholly owned subsidiary Saratoga CLO.
On
February 26, 2021, the Company completed the fourth refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This fourth Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other
things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to April 2024, and extended its legal maturity to April 2033. The non-call period
was extended to February 2022. In addition, and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $ 500
million
in assets to approximately $ 650
million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $ 14.0
million in
all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $ 17.9
million in aggregate principal amount of the Class
F-R-3 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing $ 2.5
million of Class F-R-2 Notes, $ 7.5
million of Class G-R-2 Notes and $ 25.0
million of the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan were repaid. The Company also paid $ 2.6
million of transaction costs related to the refinancing
and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO, to be reimbursed from future equity distributions. At August 31, 2021, the outstanding receivable
of $ 2.6
million was repaid in full.
On
August 9, 2021, the Company exchanged its existing $ 17.9
million Class F-R-3 Notes for $ 8.5
million Class F-1-R-3 Notes and $ 9.4
million
Class F-2-R-3 Notes at par. On August 11, 2021, the Company sold its Class F-1-R-3 Notes to third parties, resulting in a realized loss
of $ 0.1
million.
39
The
Saratoga CLO remains
100.0 % owned and managed by the Company. We receive a base management fee of
0.10 % per annum and a subordinated
management fee of
0.40 % per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO’s assets, paid quarterly to the extent of
available proceeds. Following the third refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer
entitled to an incentive management fee equal to
20.0 % of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive
an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, we accrued management fee income of $ 0.8
million and $ 0.8
million, respectively, and interest income of $ 0.2
million
and $ 1.1
million, respectively, from the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, we accrued management fee income of $ 2.5
million and $ 2.4
million, respectively, and interest income of $ 1.2
million
and $ 3.5
million, respectively, from the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO.
As of November 30, 2022, the aggregate principal
amounts of the Company’s investments in the subordinated notes and Class F-2-R-3 Notes of the Saratoga CLO was $ 111.0
million and
$ 9.4
million, respectively, which had a corresponding fair value of $ 19.4
million and $ 8.5
million, respectively. The Company determines
the fair value of its investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO based on the present value of the projected future cash flows
of the subordinated notes over the life of Saratoga CLO. As of November 30, 2022, Saratoga CLO had investments with a principal balance
of $ 653.3
million and a weighted average spread over LIBOR of
3.8 % and had debt with a principal balance of $ 611.0
million with a weighted
average spread over LIBOR of
2.2 %. As a result, Saratoga CLO earns a “spread” between the interest income it receives on its
investments and the interest expense it pays on its debt and other operating expenses, which is distributed quarterly to the Company as
the holder of its subordinated notes. As of November 30, 2022, the present value of the projected future cash flows of the subordinated
notes was approximately $ 19.4
million, using a
22.0 % discount rate. The Company’s total investment in the subordinate notes of Saratoga
CLO is $ 57.8
million, which consists of investments of $ 30
million in January 2008, $ 13.8
million in December 2018 and $ 14.0
million in
February 2021; to date, the Company has since received distributions of $ 76.7
million, management fees of $ 31.0
million and incentive
fees of $ 1.2
million.
As of February 28, 2022, the Company determined
that the fair value of its investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO was $ 28.7
million. The Company determines the fair value
of its investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO based on the present value of the projected future cash flows of the subordinated
notes over the life of Saratoga CLO. As of February 28, 2022, the fair value of its investment in the Class F-R-3 Notes was $ 9.4
million.
As of February 28, 2022, Saratoga CLO had investments with a principal balance of $ 660.2
million and a weighted average spread over LIBOR
of
3.7 % and had debt with a principal balance of $ 611.0
million with a weighted average spread over LIBOR of
2.2 %. As a result, Saratoga
CLO earns a “spread” between the interest income it receives on its investments and the interest expense it pays on its debt
and other operating expenses, which is distributed quarterly to the Company as the holder of its subordinated notes. As of February 28,
2022, the present value of the projected future cash flows of the subordinated notes was approximately $ 28.7
million, using a
15.0 % discount
rate.

5. Investment in SLF JV
On October 26, 2021, the Company and TJHA entered
into the LLC Agreement to co-manage SLF JV. SLF JV is invested in Saratoga Investment Corp Senior Loan Fund 2022-1, Ltd (“SLF 2021”),
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SLF JV. SLF 2021 was formed for the purpose of making investments in a diversified portfolio of
broadly syndicated first lien and second lien term loans or bonds in the primary and secondary markets.
On September 30, 2022, SLF 2021 was renamed to
Saratoga Investment Corp Senior Loan Fund 2022-1, Ltd. (“SLF 2022”).
The Company and TJHA have equal voting interest
on all material decisions with respect to SLF JV, including those involving its investment portfolio, and equal control of corporate governance.
No management fee is charged to SLF JV as control and management of SLF JV is shared equally.
The Company and TJHA have committed to provide
up to a combined $ 50.0
million of financing to SLF JV through cash contributions, with the Company providing $ 43.75
million and TJHA providing
$ 6.25
million, resulting in an
87.5 % and
12.5 % ownership between the two parties. The financing is issued in the form of an unsecured
note and equity. The unsecured note will pay a fixed rate of
10.0 % per annum and is due and payable in full on June 15, 2023. As of November
30, 2022, the Company and TJHA’s investment in SLF JV consisted of an unsecured note of $ 17.6
million and $ 2.5
million, respectively;
and membership interest of $ 17.6
million and $ 2.5
million, respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the Company’s
investment in the unsecured note of SLF JV had a fair value of $ 17.6
million and $ 13.1
million, respectively, and the Company’s
investment in the membership interests of SLF JV had a fair value of $ 9.2
million and $ 12.0
million, respectively.
The Company has determined that SLF JV is an investment
company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company
other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary. SLF JV is not a wholly owned investment company subsidiary as the Company and
TJHA each have an equal
50 % voting interest in SLF JV and thus neither party has a controlling financial interest. Furthermore, ASC 810,
Consolidation
concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision making authority, it is not appropriate
for one member to consolidate the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate SLF JV.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company earned $ 1.1
million of interest income related to SLF JV, which is included in interest income. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, $ 0.01
million and $ 0.1
million, respectively, of interest income related to SLF JV was included in interest receivable.
SLF JV’s initial investment in SLF 2022
was in the form of an unsecured loan. The unsecured loan paid a floating rate of LIBOR plus
7.00 % per annum and was due and payable in
full on June 9, 2023. The unsecured loan was repaid in full on October 28, 2022, as part of the CLO closing.
On October 28, 2022, SLF 2022 issued $ 402.1
million
of the 2022 JV CLO Notes through the JV CLO trust. The 2022 JV CLO Notes were issued pursuant to the JV Indenture, with the Trustee. As
part of the transaction, the Company purchased
87.50 % of the Class E Notes from SLF 2022 with a par value of $ 12.25
million.
As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the fair value of these Class E Notes were $ 11.0
million and $ 0.0
million, respectively.

6. Income Taxes
SIA-ARC,
Inc., SIA-Avionte, Inc., SIA-AX, Inc., SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-MAC, Inc., SIA-PP Inc., SIA-TG, Inc., SIA-TT Inc., SIA-Vector, Inc., and SIA-VR,
Inc. each
100 % owned by the Company, are each filing standalone C Corporation tax returns for federal and state tax purposes. As separately
regarded entities for tax purposes, these entities are taxed at normal corporate rates. For tax purposes, any distributions by the entities
to the parent company would generally need to be distributed to the Company’s shareholders. Generally, such distributions of the
entities’ income to the Company’s shareholders will be considered as qualified dividends for tax purposes. The entities’
taxable net income will differ from U.S. GAAP net income because of deferred tax temporary differences arising from net operating losses
and unrealized appreciation and deprecation of securities held. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted corporate
federal and state tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those net operating losses are utilized and the
unrealized gains and losses are realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted off by entity, as allowed. The
recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not
that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized on the basis of a history of operating losses combined with insufficient
projected taxable income or other taxable events in the taxable blockers. In February 2022, SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-TT Inc. and SIA-VR, Inc.
received an approved plan of liquidation following the sale of equity held by each of the portfolio companies.
The
Company may distribute a portion of its realized net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses to its
stockholders, but may also decide to retain a portion, or all, of its net capital gains and elect to pay the
21 % U.S. federal tax on
the net capital gain, potentially in the form of a “deemed distribution” to its stockholders. Income tax (provision) relating
to an election to retain its net capital gains, including in the form of a deemed distribution, is included as a component of income
tax (provision) benefit from realized gains on investments, depending on the character of the underlying taxable income (ordinary or
capital gains), on the consolidated statements of operations.
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities, and related valuation allowance as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 were as follows:
November 30,
2022
February 28,
2022

$ ( 2,139,660 )
$ ( 1,249,016 )
As of November 30, 2022, the valuation allowance
on deferred tax liability was $ 2.2
million, which represents the federal and state tax effect of net operating losses and unrealized losses
that we do not believe we will realize through future taxable income. Any adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance will
depend on estimates of future taxable income and will be made in the period such determination is made.

7. Agreements and Related Party Transactions
Investment
Advisory and Management Agreement
On
July 30, 2010, the Company entered into the Management Agreement with our Manager. The initial term of the Management Agreement was two
years from its effective date, with one-year renewals thereafter subject to certain approvals by our board of directors and/or the Company’s
stockholders. Most recently, on July 5, 2022, our board of directors approved the renewal of the Management Agreement for an additional
one-year term. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager implements our business strategy on a day-to-day basis and performs
certain services for us, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other duties, determining
investment criteria, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments transactions, asset sales, financings and performing asset management
duties. Under the Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Manager a management fee for investment advisory and management services
consisting of a base management fee and an incentive management fee.
Base
Management Fee and Incentive Management Fee
The
base management fee of 1.75% per year is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets (other than cash or cash equivalents,
but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters.
The base management
fee is paid quarterly following the filing of the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
The
incentive management fee consists of the following two parts:
The
first, payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the
value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, that exceeds a 1.875% quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the
end of each fiscal quarter, subject to a “catch-up” provision.
Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, our Manager receives
no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Our Manager will receive 100.0%
of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter;
and 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.344% in any fiscal quarter.
There is no
accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no claw back of amounts previously paid
if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly
hurdle rate.
The
second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Management
Agreement) and equals
20.0 % of our “incentive fee capital gains,” which equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative
basis from May 31, 2010 through the end of the fiscal year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital
depreciation on a cumulative basis on each investment in the Company’s portfolio, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid
capital gain incentive fee. Importantly, the capital gains portion of the incentive fee is based on realized gains and realized and unrealized
losses from May 31, 2010. Therefore, realized and unrealized losses incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating
the capital gains portion of the incentive fee, and our Manager will be entitled to
20.0 % of incentive fee capital gains that arise after
May 31, 2010. In addition, for the purpose of the “incentive fee capital gains” calculations, the cost basis for computing
realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 will equal the fair value of such investments as of such date.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, the Company incurred $ 4.3
million and $ 2.9
million in base management fees, respectively. For the three months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 2.3
million and $ 1.5
million in incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment
income, respectively. For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the Company accrued a (benefit) of $( 0.8 ) million
and an expense of $ 0.9
million in incentive fees related to capital gains.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, the Company incurred $ 12.2
million and $ 8.7
million in base management fees, respectively. For the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the Company incurred $ 3.9
million and $ 4.8
million in incentive fees related to pre-incentive
fee net investment income, respectively. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the Company accrued a (benefit)
of ($ 3.7 ) million and an expense of $ 4.9
million in incentive fees related to capital gains.
The accrual is calculated using both realized
and unrealized capital gains for the period. The actual incentive fee related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears
at the end of the fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period. As of November 30, 2022, the base management
fees accrual was $ 4.3
million and the incentive fees accrual was $ 5.3
million and is included in base management and incentive fees payable
in the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of February 28, 2022, the base management fees accrual was
$ 3.2
million and the incentive fees accrual was $ 9.8
million and is included in base management and incentive fees payable in the accompanying
consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.

Saratoga
CLO
On
December 14, 2018, the Company completed the third refinancing and issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes. This refinancing, among other
things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to January 2021, and extended its legal maturity to January 2030. A non-call period
ending January 2020 was also added. In addition, and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $ 300

in assets to approximately $ 500
million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $ 13.8
million in
all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $ 2.5
million in aggregate principal amount of the Class
F-R-2 Notes tranche and $ 7.5
million in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing
$ 4.5
million of Class F notes and $ 20.0

costs related to the refinancing and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO, to be reimbursed from future equity distributions. During
the year ended February 29, 2020, the Company received full payment of $ 1.7
million from the Saratoga CLO for such transaction costs.
In
conjunction with the third refinancing and issuance of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, the Company is no longer entitled
to receive an incentive management fee from Saratoga CLO. See Note 4 for additional information.

SLF
JV
On
October 26, 2021, the Company and TJHA entered into an LLC Agreement to co-manage the SLF JV. SLF JV is a joint venture that is expected
to invest in the debt or equity interests of collateralized loan obligations, loan, notes and other debt instruments.
On October 28, 2022, SLF 2022 issued $402.1 million
of the 2022 JV CLO Notes through the JV CLO trust. The 2022 JV CLO Notes were issued pursuant to the JV Indenture, with the Trustee.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company’s investment in the SLF
JV had a fair value of $ 26.8
million, consisting of an unsecured loan of $ 17.6
million and membership interest of $ 9.2
million. In addition,
the Company has no outstanding receivable balance from the SLF JV as of November 30, 2022.
As part of the JV CLO trust transaction, the
Company purchased
87.50 % of the Class E Notes from SLF 2022 with a par value of $ 12.25
million.
Note
8. Borrowings
Credit
Facility
As
a BDC, we are only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200%
after giving effect to such leverage, or, 150% if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met.
On April 16, 2018, as permitted by
the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our board of directors, including a majority
of our directors who are not “interested persons” (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act”) of the Company
(“independent directors”), approved a minimum asset coverage ratio of
150 %. The
150 % asset coverage ratio became effective
on April 16, 2019. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the
time of any proposed borrowing. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was
173.2 % as of November 30, 2022 and
209.3 % as
of February 28, 2022.
78
On
April 11, 2007, we entered into a $ 100.0
million revolving securitized credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). On May
1, 2007, we entered into a $ 25.7
million term securitized credit facility (the “Term Facility” and, together with the Revolving
Facility, the “Facilities”), which was fully drawn at closing. In December 2007, we consolidated the Facilities by using
a draw under the Revolving Facility to repay the Term Facility. In response to the market wide decline in financial asset prices, which
negatively affected the value of our portfolio, we terminated the revolving period of the Revolving Facility effective January 14, 2009
and commenced a two-year amortization period during which all principal proceeds from the collateral were used to repay outstanding borrowings.
A significant percentage of our total assets had been pledged under the Revolving Facility to secure our obligations thereunder.
Under
the Revolving Facility, funds were borrowed from or through certain lenders and interest was payable monthly at the greater of the commercial
paper rate and our lender’s prime rate plus 4.00% plus a default rate of 2.00% or, if the commercial paper market was unavailable,
the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rates and our lender’s prime rate plus 6.00% plus a default rate of 3.00%.
On July 30, 2010, we used the net proceeds from
(i) the stock purchase transaction and (ii) a portion of the funds available to us under the $ 45.0
million senior secured revolving credit
facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the “Madison Credit Facility”), in each case, to pay the full amount of principal
and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As a result, the Revolving Facility was terminated
in connection therewith. Substantially all of our total assets, other than those held by SBIC LP and SBIC II LP was pledged under the
Madison Credit Facility to secure our obligations thereunder.
On
February 24, 2012, we amended the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
expand
the borrowing capacity under the Madison Credit Facility from $40.0 million to $45.0 million;
●
extend
the period during which we may make and repay borrowings under the Madison Credit Facility from July 30, 2013 to February 24, 2015
(the “Revolving Period”). The Revolving Period may, upon the occurrence of an event of default, by action of the lenders
or automatically, be terminated. All borrowings and other amounts payable under the Madison Credit Facility are due and payable five
years after the end of the Revolving Period; and
●
remove
the condition that we may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of Madison Capital Funding LLC.
On
September 17, 2014, we entered into a second amendment to the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
extend the commitment termination date from February 24, 2015 to September 17, 2017;
●
extend
the maturity date of the Madison Credit Facility from February 24, 2020 to September 17, 2022 (unless terminated sooner upon certain
events);
●
reduce
the applicable margin rate on base rate borrowings from 4.50% to 3.75%, and on LIBOR borrowings from 5.50% to 4.75%; and
●
reduce
the floor on base rate borrowings from 3.00% to 2.25%, and on LIBOR borrowings from 2.00% to 1.25%.
79
On
May 18, 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
extend
the commitment termination date from September 17, 2017 to September 17, 2020;
●
extend
the final maturity date of the Madison Credit Facility from September 17, 2022 to September 17, 2025 (unless terminated sooner upon
certain events);
●
reduce
the floor on base rate borrowings from 2.25% to 2.00%;
●
reduce
the floor on LIBOR borrowings from 1.25% to 1.00%; and
●
reduce
the commitment fee rate from 0.75% to 0.50% for any period during which the ratio of advances outstanding to aggregate commitments,
expressed as a percentage, is greater than or equal to 50%.
On
April 24, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
permit
certain amendments related to the Paycheck Protection Program (“Permitted PPP Amendment”) to Loan Asset Documents;
●
exclude
certain debt and interest amounts allowed by the Permitted PPP Amendments from certain calculations related to Net Leverage Ratio,
Interest Coverage Ratio and EBITDA; and
●
exclude
such Permitted PPP Amendments from constituting a Material Modification.
On
September 14, 2020, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
extend
the commitment termination date of the Madison Credit Facility from September 17, 2020 to September 17, 2021, with no change to the
maturity date of September 17, 2025.
●
provide
for the transition away from the LIBOR Rate in the market, and
●
expand
the definition of “Eligible Loan Asset” to allow investments with certain recurring revenue features to qualify as collateral
and be included in the borrowing base.
On
September 13, 2021, we entered into a sixth amendment to the Madison Credit Facility to, among other things:
●
Extend
the commitment termination date of the Madison Credit Facility from September 17, 2021 to October 1, 2021, with no change to maturity
date of September 17, 2025.
On
October 4, 2021, all outstanding amounts on the Madison Credit Facility were repaid and the Madison Credit Facility was terminated. The
repayment and termination of the Madison Credit Facility resulted in a realized loss on the extinguishment of debt of $ 0.8
million.
On
October 4, 2021, the Company entered into a $ 50.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility with the Lender, supported by loans
held by SIF II and pledged to the Encina Credit Facility. During the first two years following the closing date, SIF II may request an
increase in the commitment amount to up to $ 75.0
million. The terms of the Encina Credit Facility require a minimum drawn amount of $12.5
million at all times during the first six months following the closing date, which increases to the greater of $25.0 million or 50% of
the commitment amount in effect at any time thereafter. The term of the Encina Credit Facility is three years. Advances under the Encina
Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.0%, with LIBOR having a floor of 0.75%, with customary
provisions related to the selection by the Lender and the Company of a replacement benchmark rate. The commitment termination date is
October 4, 2024.
In
addition to any fees or other amounts payable under the terms of the Encina Credit Facility, an administrative agent fee per annum equal
to $ 0.1
million is payable in equal monthly installments in arrears.
80
As
of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, there were $ 25.0
million and $ 12.5
million outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility.
During the applicable periods, the Company was in compliance with all of the limitations and requirements of the Encina Credit Facility.
Financing costs of $ 1.4
million related to the Encina Credit Facility have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of
the Encina Credit Facility.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, we recorded $ 0.6
million and $ 0.2
million of interest expense related to the Encina Credit Facility and the Madison
Credit Facility, respectively, which includes commitment and administrative agent fees. For the three months ended November 30, 2022
and November 30, 2021, we recorded $ 0.1  million and $ 0.08
million of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Encina
Credit Facility and the Madison Credit Facility, respectively. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are reported
as interest and debt financing expense on the consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended November 30, 2022,
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility was
7.19 %, and the average dollar amount
of outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility was $ 32.8  million.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, we recorded $ 1.2
million and $ 0.6
million of interest expense related to the Encina Credit Facility and the Madison
Credit Facility, respectively, which includes commitment and administrative agent fees. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022
and November 30, 2021, we recorded $ 0.3  million and $ 0.2
million of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Encina
Credit Facility and the Madison Credit Facility, respectively. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are reported
as interest and debt financing expense on the consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, the
weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility was
6.16 %, and the average dollar amount
of outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility was $ 25.9  million.
The
Encina Credit Facility contains limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used, such as restrictions on industry concentrations, asset
size, weighted average life, currency denomination and collateral interests. The Encina Credit Facility also includes certain requirements
relating to portfolio performance, the violation of which could result in the limit of further advances and, in some cases, result in
an event of default, allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of amounts owed thereunder.
Availability on the Encina Credit Facility
will be subject to a borrowing base calculation, based on, among other things, applicable advance rates (which vary from 50.0% to 75.0%
of par or fair value depending on the type of loan asset) and the value of certain “eligible” loan assets included as part
of the borrowing base. The Company will pay the lender a commitment fee of 0.75% per year (or 0.50% if the ratio of advances outstanding
to aggregate commitments is greater than or equal to 50%) on the unused amount of the Encina Credit Facility.
Our borrowing base under the Encina Credit Facility
was $ 69.8
million subject to the Encina Credit Facility cap of $ 50.0
million at November 30, 2022. For purposes of determining the borrowing
base, most assets are assigned the values set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC. Accordingly, the November 30, 2022 borrowing base relies upon the valuations set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the period ended August 31, 2022. The valuations presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will not be incorporated into the
borrowing base until after this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC.
SBA
Debentures
Our
wholly owned SBIC subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which generally approximates equity
capital in respective SBIC) and is subject to customary regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, a periodic examination
by the SBA.
On August 14, 2019, the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, SBIC II LP, received an SBIC license from the SBA. On September 29, 2022, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
SBIC III LP, also received an SBIC license from the SBA. SBIC LP’s license provided up to $ 150.0
million in additional long-term
capital in the form of SBA debentures, while SBIC II LP’s and SBIC III LP’s SBIC licenses provide up to $ 175.0
million each.
Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed
$350.0 million with at least $175.0 million in combined regulatory capital.
With the third license approval, Saratoga can continue
to grow its SBA relationship from $150.0 million to $350.0 million of committed capital.
81
As of November 30, 2022, we have funded SBIC LP,
SBIC II LP and SBIC III LP with an aggregate total of equity capital of $ 75.0
million, $ 87.5
million and $ 2.5
million, respectively, and
have $ 242.7
million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, of which $ 67.7
million was held in SBIC LP, $ 175.0
million was held in SBIC
II LP, and $ 0.0
million held in SBIC III LP.
SBA debentures are non-recourse to us, have a 10-year maturity, and may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven
spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. SBA current regulations limit the amount that SBIC LP, SBIC II LP and SBIC III LP may borrow
to a maximum of $150.0 million, $175.0 million, and $175.0 million, respectively, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital.
Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed
$350.0 million with at least $175.0 million in combined regulatory capital.
SBICs
are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans
to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses
include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $ 24.0
million and have average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding
$ 8.0
million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote
25.0 % of its investment activity to ‘‘smaller
enterprises’’ as defined by the SBA. A smaller enterprise is one that has a tangible net worth not exceeding $ 6.0
million
and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $ 2.0
million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide
alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based
on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses,
invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services.
SBIC
LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining
certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that SBIC II LP or SBIC III LP will
receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon SBIC II LP and SBIC III LP continuing to be in compliance with SBA
regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP assets over our
stockholders and debtholders in the event we liquidate SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP or the SBA exercises its remedies under the
SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP upon an event of default.
The
Company received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit it to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC subsidiaries from the definition
of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. This allows the Company increased
flexibility under the asset coverage requirement by permitting it to borrow up to $ 325.0
million more than it would otherwise be able
to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On April 16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which
was signed into law on March 23, 2018, the independent directors of the Company approved of the Company becoming subject to a minimum
asset coverage ratio of
150.0 % from
200 % under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. The
150.0 % asset coverage ratio became
effective on April 16, 2019.
As noted above, as of November 30, 2022, there
was $242.7 million of SBA debentures outstanding and as of February 28, 2022, there was $185.0 million of SBA debentures outstanding.

12. Earnings Per Share
In
accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 260,
Earnings per Share
(“ASC 260”), basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a
diluted basis.
The following information sets forth the computation of the weighted average basic and diluted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations per share for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021 (dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts):

13. Dividend
On November 15, 2022, the Company declared a dividend
of $ 0.68
per share payable on January 4, 2023, to common stockholders of record on
December 15, 2022 . Shareholders have the option to
receive payment of the dividend in cash, or receive shares of common stock, pursuant to the DRIP. Based on shareholder elections, the
dividend consisted of approximately $ 6.8
million in cash and
53,615
newly issued shares of common stock, or
0.5 % of our outstanding common
stock prior to the dividend payment. The number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on a price
of $ 24.26
per share, which equaled
95 % of the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on December 20, 21,
22, 23, 27, 28, 29 and 30, 2022 and January 3 and 4, 2023.
On August 29, 2022, the Company declared a dividend
of $ 0.54
per share payable on September 29, 2022, to common stockholders of record on
September 14, 2022 . Shareholders have the option
to receive payment of the dividend in cash, or receive shares of common stock, pursuant to the DRIP. Based on shareholder elections,
the dividend consisted of approximately $ 5.3
million in cash and
52,313
newly issued shares of common stock, or
0.4 % of our outstanding
common stock prior to the dividend payment. The number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on
a price of $ 22.00
per share, which equaled
95 % of the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on September
16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28 and 29, 2022.

* Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
(1) Per
share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
(2) The continuous issuance of common stock may cause an incremental increase
in NAV per share due to the sale of shares at the then prevailing public offering price and the receipt of net proceeds per share by the
Company in excess of NAV per share on each subscription closing date. The per share data was derived by computing (i) the sum of (A) the
number of shares issued in connection with subscriptions and/or distribution reinvestment on each share transaction date multiplied by
(B) the differences between the net proceeds per share and the NAV per share on each share transaction date, divided by (ii) the total
shares outstanding during the period.
(3) Represents the anti-dilutive impact on the NAV per share of the Company
due to the repurchase of common shares. See Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity.
(4) Represents the dilutive effect of issuing common stock below NAV per
share during the period in connection with the satisfaction of the Company’s annual RIC distribution requirement and may include
the impact of the different share amounts used for different items (weighted average basic common shares outstanding for the corresponding
year and actual common shares outstanding at the end of the year) in the per common share data calculation and rounding impacts. See Note
13, Dividend.
(5) Ratios
are not annualized.
(6) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common
shares at the current market value on the first day and a sale at the current market value on the last day of the periods reported. Dividends
and distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under the DRIP. Total investment
return does not reflect brokerage commissions.

Incentive management fees included within the ratio are not annualized.
(9) Ratios
are annualized.
(10) Portfolio
turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of year-to-date sales or year-to-date purchases over the average of the invested assets
at fair value.
(11) Asset
coverage ratio per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of our total consolidated assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not
represented by senior securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness. Asset coverage ratio per unit

of indebtedness. Asset coverage ratio per unit does not include unfunded commitments.
The inclusion of unfunded commitments in the calculation of the asset coverage ratio per unit would not cause us to be below the required
amount of regulatory coverage.

Note
15. Subsequent Events
The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that there have been
no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements except for the following:
On December 13, 2022, the Company issued $52.5
million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% fixed-rate notes due 2027 (the “8.125% 2027 Notes”) for net proceeds of
$50.9 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.6 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.1
million. The Company has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $7.875 million in aggregate principal
amount of the 8.125% 2027 Notes. Interest on the 8.125% 2027 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and
November 30, at a rate of 8.125% per year, beginning February 28, 2023.  The 8.125% 2027 Notes mature on December 31, 2027 and commencing
December 13, 2024, may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. We expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering to make investments in middle-market companies (including investments made through our SBIC subsidiaries) in accordance
with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes. Financing costs of $1.6 million related to the 8.125%
2027 Notes have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 8.125% 2027 Notes. The 8.125% 2027 Notes are listed on the
NYSE under the trading symbol “SAY” with a par value of $25.00 per note.
On December 21, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised
their option to purchase an additional $7.875 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.125% 2027 Notes. Net proceeds to the Company
were $7.6 million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $0.2 million.
On January 9, 2023, our board of directors extended the Share Repurchase Plan for another year to January 15, 2024, increasing the number
of shares to
1.7
million shares of common stock.

OVERVIEW
We
are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
Act”). Our investment objective is to create attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income and long-term capital
appreciation from our investments. We invest primarily in senior and unitranche leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private
U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies having earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)
of between $2 million and $50 million, both through direct lending and through participation in loan syndicates. We may also invest up
to 30.0% of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include
investments in distressed debt, which may include securities of companies in bankruptcy, foreign debt, private equity, securities of
public companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we
have no current intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are
excluded from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which includes
private equity funds, to no more than 15.0% of its net assets. We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
Corporate
History
We
commenced operations, at the time known as GSC Investment Corp., on March 23, 2007 and completed an initial public offering of shares
of common stock on March 28, 2007. Prior to July 30, 2010, we were externally managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P., an entity affiliated
with GSC Group, Inc. In connection with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on July 30, 2010, as described below we engaged
Saratoga Investment Advisors to replace GSCP (NJ), L.P. as our investment adviser and changed our name to Saratoga Investment Corp.
As
a result of the event of default under a revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank we previously had in place, in December
2008 we engaged the investment banking firm of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company to evaluate strategic transaction opportunities and consider
alternatives for us. On April 14, 2010, GSC Investment Corp. entered into a stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors
and certain of its affiliates and an assignment, assumption and novation agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, pursuant to which
GSC Investment Corp. assumed certain rights and obligations of Saratoga Investment Advisors under a debt commitment letter Saratoga Investment
Advisors received from Madison Capital Funding LLC, which indicated Madison Capital Funding’s willingness to provide GSC Investment
Corp. with a $40.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In
addition, GSC Investment Corp. and GSCP (NJ), L.P. entered into a termination and release agreement, to be effective as of the closing
of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which GSCP (NJ), L.P., among other things, agreed to waive
any and all accrued and unpaid deferred incentive management fees up to and as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the
stock purchase agreement but continued to be entitled to receive the base management fees earned through the date of the closing of the
transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement.
On
July 30, 2010, the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates
were completed, the private sale of 986,842 shares of our common stock for $15.0 million in aggregate purchase price to Saratoga Investment
Advisors and certain of its affiliates closed, the Company entered into the Madison Credit Facility, and the Company began doing business
as Saratoga Investment Corp.
We
used the net proceeds from the private sale transaction and a portion of the funds available to us under the Madison Credit Facility
to pay the full amount of principal and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under our revolving securitized credit
facility with Deutsche Bank. The revolving securitized credit facility with Deutsche Bank was terminated in connection with our payment
of all amounts outstanding thereunder on July 30, 2010.
On
August 12, 2010, we effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split,
every ten shares of our common stock were converted into one share of our common stock. Any fractional shares received as a result of
the reverse stock split were redeemed for cash. The total cash payment in lieu of shares was $230. Immediately after the reverse stock
split, we had 2,680,842 shares of our common stock outstanding.
106
In
January 2011, we registered for public resale of the 986,842 shares of our common stock issued to Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain
of its affiliates.

license from the SBA. On September 29, 2022, our wholly owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC III LP (“SBIC III LP”),

In May 2013, we issued $48.3 million in aggregate
principal amount of our 7.50% fixed-rate unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) for net proceeds of $46.1 million after
deducting underwriting commissions of $1.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The proceeds included the underwriters’ full
exercise of their overallotment option. The 2020 Notes were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading
symbol “SAQ” with a par value of $25.00 per note. The 2020 Notes were redeemed in full on January 13, 2017 and are no longer

for approximately $19.5 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Plan. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 the Company purchased

notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased $17.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-3 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently,
the existing $2.5 million of Class F-R-2 Notes, $7.5 million of Class G-R-2 Notes and $25.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan were
repaid. The Company also paid $2.6 million of transaction costs related to the refinancing and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO,
to be reimbursed from future equity distributions. At August 31, 2021, the outstanding receivable of $2.6 million was paid in full.
On March 10, 2021, the Company issued $50.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of our 4.375% fixed-rate Notes due in 2026 (the “4.375% Notes 2026”) for net proceeds of $49.0
million after deducting underwriting commissions of approximately $1.0 million. Offering costs incurred were approximately $0.2 million. Interest
on the 4.375% Notes 2026 is paid semi-annually in arrears on February 28 and August 28, at a rate of 4.375% per year. The 4.375%
Notes 2026 mature on February 28, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time on or after November 28, 2025 at par plus a
“make-whole” premium, and thereafter at par. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes in
accordance with our investment objective and strategies. Financing costs of $1.2 million related to the 4.375% Notes 2026 have been
capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the 4.375% Notes 2026.
On July 15, 2021, the Company issued an additional
$125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 4.375% Notes 2026 (the “Additional 4.375% 2026 Notes”)
for net proceeds for approximately $123.5 million, based on the public offering price of 101.00% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Additional 4.375% 2026 Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount of $2.5 million and the offering expenses payable by the Company .
The net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all of the outstanding 6.25% 2025 Notes (as described above), and for general corporate
purposes in accordance with our investment objective and strategies. The Additional 4.375% 2026 Notes were treated as a single series
with the existing 4.375% 2026 Notes under the indenture and had the same terms as the existing 4.375% 2026 Notes.

On
July 30, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. and Compass Point Research and
Trading, LLC (the “Agents”), through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $150.0 million of our common stock
through the Agents, or to them, as principal for their account. As of November 30, 2022, the Company sold 4,840,361 shares for gross
proceeds of $124.0 million at an average price of $25.61 for aggregate net proceeds of $122.4 million (net of transaction costs). During
the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, there were no shares sold pursuant to the equity distribution agreement with the Agents.
On
August 9, 2021, the Company exchanged its existing $17.9 million Class F-R-3 Notes for $8.5 million Class F-1-R-3 Notes and $9.4 million
Class F-2-R-3 Notes at par. On August 11, 2021, the Company sold its Class F-1-R-3 Notes to third parties, resulting in a realized loss
of $0.1 million.
The
Company has formed a wholly owned special purpose entity, Saratoga Investment Funding II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SIF
II”), for the purpose of entering into a $50.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Encina Lender Finance, LLC
(the “Lender”), supported by loans held by SIF II and pledged to the Lender under the credit facility (the “Encina
Credit Facility). The Encina Credit Facility closed on October 4, 2021. During the first two years following the closing date, SIF II
may request an increase in the commitment amount under the Encina Credit Facility to up to $75.0 million. The terms of the Encina Credit
Facility require a minimum drawn amount of $12.5 million at all times during the first six months following the closing date, which increases
to the greater of $25.0 million or 50% of the commitment amount in effect at any time thereafter. The term of the Encina Credit Facility
is three years. Advances under the Encina Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.0%, with LIBOR
having a floor of 0.75%, with customary provisions related to the selection by the Lender and the Company of a replacement benchmark
rate. Concurrently with the closing of the Encina Credit Facility, all remaining amounts outstanding on the Company’s existing
revolving credit facility with Madison Capital Funding, LLC were repaid and the facility terminated.
On
October 26, 2021, the Company and TJHA JV I LLC (“TJHA”) entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC
Agreement”) to co-manage Saratoga Senior Loan Fund I JV LLC (“SLF JV”). SLF JV is invested in Saratoga Investment Corp
Senior Loan Fund 2022-1 Ltd (“SLF 2022”), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SLF JV. SLF 2022 was formed for the purpose
of making investments in a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated first lien and second lien term loans or bonds in the primary
and secondary markets.
The
Company and TJHA have equal voting interest on all material decisions with respect to SLF JV, including those involving its investment
portfolio, and equal control of corporate governance. No management fee is charged to SLF JV as control and management of SLF JV is shared
equally.
The Company and TJHA have committed to provide
up to a combined $50.0 million of financing to SLF JV through cash contributions, with the Company providing $43.75 million and TJHA providing
$6.25 million, resulting in an 87.5% and 12.5% ownership between the two parties. The financing is issued in the form of an unsecured
note and equity. The unsecured note will pay a fixed rate of 10.0% per annum and is due and payable in full on June 15, 2023. As of November
30, 2022, the Company and TJHA’s investment in SLF JV consisted of an unsecured note of $17.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively;
and membership interest of $17.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company earned $1.1
million of interest income related to SLF JV, which is included in interest income.
SLF JV’s initial investment in SLF 2022
was in the form of an unsecured loan. The unsecured loan paid a floating rate of LIBOR plus 7.00% per annum and was due and payable in
full on June 9, 2023. The unsecured loan was repaid in full on October 28, 2022, as part of the CLO closing.
The Company has determined that SLF JV is an investment
company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company
other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary. SLF JV is not a wholly owned investment company subsidiary as the Company and
TJHA each have an equal 50% voting interest in SLF JV and thus neither party has a controlling financial interest. Furthermore, ASC 810
concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision-making authority, it is not appropriate for one member to consolidate
the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate SLF JV.

Recent COVID-19 Developments
We have been closely monitoring, and will continue
to monitor, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including new variants of COVID-19) and its impact on all aspects of our business, including
how it will impact our portfolio companies, employees, due diligence and underwriting processes, and financial markets. Given the continued
fluidity of the pandemic, we cannot estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, future results of operations, financial
position or cash flows at this time. Further, the operational and financial performance of the portfolio companies in which we make investments
may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, which may in turn impact the valuation of our investments. We believe our portfolio companies
have taken, and continue to take, immediate actions to effectively and efficiently respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and related
restrictions imposed by state and local governments and other private businesses, including developing liquidity plans supported by internal
cash reserves, and shareholder support. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused,
and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and restrictions on travel, significant reductions in demand
for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain disruptions, labor difficulties
and shortages, commodity inflation and elements of economic and financial market instability in the United States and globally. Such effects
will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Basis of Presentation
The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
affecting amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue
recognition and the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate
our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently
available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates
follows.
Investment Valuation
The Company accounts for its investments at fair
value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities
are to be transferred at the measurement date in the principal market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal
market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in
the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.
Investments for which market quotations are readily
available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing services and market makers subject to
any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of these
investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved, in good faith, by our
board of directors based on input from Saratoga Investment Advisors, the audit committee of our board of directors and a third party independent
valuation firm. We use multiple techniques for determining fair value based on the nature of the investment and experience with those
types of investments and specific portfolio companies. The selections of the valuation techniques and the inputs and assumptions used
within those techniques often require subjective judgements and estimates. These techniques include market comparables, discounted cash
flows and enterprise value waterfalls. Fair value is best expressed as a range of values from which the Company determines a single best
estimate. The types of inputs and assumptions that may be considered in determining the range of values of our investments include the
nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis and
volatility in future interest rates, call and put features, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly
traded companies, discounted cash flows and other relevant factors.
113
We undertake a multi-step valuation process each
quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below:
●
Each investment is initially valued by the responsible investment professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; and
●
An independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors independently reviews a selection of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year. We use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO,the Class F-2-R-3 Notes  tranche of the Saratoga CLO and the Class E Notes tranche of the SLF 2022 every quarter.
In addition, all our investments are subject to
the following valuation process:
●
The audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves each preliminary valuation and Saratoga Investment Advisors and an independent valuation firm (if applicable) will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and
●
Our board of directors discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of Saratoga Investment Advisors, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors.
Our investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at fair
value, which is based on a discounted cash flows that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience
and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and market comparables for equity interests
in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available, as determined by Saratoga Investment Advisors and recommended
to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flows, or an appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of
our investment in Saratoga CLO. The cash flows use a set of inputs including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rates
and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The inputs are based on available market data and projections provided
by third parties as well as management estimates. We use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows) to perform
a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine the valuation for our investment in Saratoga CLO.
In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) adopted a new rule providing a framework for fund valuation practices. New Rule 2a-5 under the 1940
Act (“Rule 2a-5”) establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Rule 2a-5
will permit boards, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate certain parties to perform fair value determinations.
Rule 2a-5 also defines when market quotations are “readily available” for purposes of the 1940 Act and the threshold for determining
whether a fund must determine the fair value of a security. The SEC also adopted new Rule 31a-4 under the 1940 Act (“Rule 31a-4”),
which provides the recordkeeping requirements associated with fair value determinations. Finally, the SEC is rescinding previously issued
guidance on related issues, including the role of the board in determining fair value and the accounting and auditing of fund investments.
Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4 became effective on March 8, 2021, and had a compliance date of September 8, 2022. While our board of directors
has not elected to designate Saratoga Investment Advisors as the valuation designee, the Company has adopted certain revisions to its
valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4.
114
Revenue Recognition
Income Recognition
Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium
and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops
accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums on investments
purchased are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments
represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments.
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status
when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed
on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management’s
judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and,
in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient
collateral value and is in the process of collection.
Payment-in-Kind Interest
The Company holds debt and preferred equity investments
in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provision. The PIK interest, which represents contractually
deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the
extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing PIK interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal
and interest when due.
Revenues
We generate revenue in the form of interest income
and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains, if any, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect our
debt investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest at
either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our debt
or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be
payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate
principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at
the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for
providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be generated in connection
with our investments and recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or common equity securities that pay dividends on
a current basis.
On January 22, 2008, we entered into a collateral
management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced
in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016. On November 15, 2016, we completed a second refinancing of the
Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October 2018.
On December 14, 2018, we completed a third refinancing
and upsize of the Saratoga CLO. The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021,
and extended its legal maturity date to January 2030. A non-call period of January 2020 was also added. Following this refinancing, the
Saratoga CLO portfolio increased from approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount to approximately $500.0 million of predominantly
senior secured first lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we invested an additional $13.8 million in all of the
newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2 and
$7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of 3M USD LIBOR plus 8.75% and 3M USD
LIBOR plus 10.00%, respectively. As part of this refinancing, we also redeemed our existing $4.5 million in aggregate amount of the Class
F notes tranche at par and the $20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan was repaid.
On February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an
unsecured loan agreement with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd. (“CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2”), a wholly
owned subsidiary Saratoga CLO.
On February 26, 2021, the Company completed the
fourth refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This fourth Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment
period to April 2024, and extended its legal maturity to April 2033. The non-call period was extended to February 2022. In addition, and
as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO has also been upsized from $500 million in assets to approximately $650 million. As part
of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company invested an additional $14.0 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the
Saratoga CLO, and purchased $17.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-3 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing
$2.5 million of Class F-R-2 Notes, $7.5 million of Class G-R-2 Notes and $25.0 million of the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan were repaid.
The Company also paid $2.6 million of transaction costs related to the refinancing and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO, to be reimbursed
from future equity distributions. At August 31, 2021, the outstanding receivable of $2.6 million was repaid in full.
115
On August 9, 2021, the Company exchanged its existing
$17.9 million Class F-R-3 Notes for $8.5 million Class F-1-R-3 Notes and $9.4 million Class F-2-R-3 Notes at par. On August 11, 2021,
the Company sold its Class F-1-R-3 Notes to third parties, resulting in a realized loss of $0.1 million.
The Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100% owned
and managed by Saratoga Investment Corp. We receive a base management fee of 0.10% per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.40%
per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO’s assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. Prior
to the second refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Amended CLO Notes, we received a base management fee of 0.25% per annum and a
subordinated management fee of 0.25% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO’s assets, paid quarterly to the
extent of available proceeds.
Following the third refinancing and the issuance
of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0% of excess
cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.
Interest income on our investment in Saratoga CLO
is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 325-40,
Investments-Other, Beneficial
Interests in Securitized Financial Assets
(“ASC 325-40”), based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows
over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes
in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the
estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed.
Expenses
Our primary operating expenses include the payment
of investment advisory and management fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance, fees paid to directors who are not “interested
persons” (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of the Company (“independent directors”) and administrator
expenses, including our allocable portion of our administrator’s overhead. Our investment advisory and management fees compensate

●

●
direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and
●
administration fees and all other expenses incurred by us or, if applicable, the administrator in connection with administering our business (including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator’s overhead in performing its obligations under an Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs (including travel expenses)).
Pursuant to the investment advisory and management
agreement that we had with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser and administrator, we had agreed to pay GSCP (NJ), L.P. as investment
adviser a quarterly base management fee of 1.75% of the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including
assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and an incentive fee.
The incentive fee had two parts:
●
A fee, payable quarterly in arrears, equal to 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, that exceeded a 1.875% quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee. Since the hurdle rate was based on net assets, a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee.
●
A fee, payable at the end of each fiscal year, equal to 20.0% of our net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, in each case on a cumulative basis on each investment in the Company’s portfolio, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date.
We deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise
earned by our former investment adviser if, during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such
payment was to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total
assets less liabilities) (before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period) was less than 7.5% of our net assets
at the beginning of such period. These calculations were appropriately pro-rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and
adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. Such incentive fee would become payable on the next date
on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory
and management agreement. We commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended August 31, 2007 and
continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended May 31, 2010. As of July 30, 2010, the date on which GSCP (NJ), L.P.
ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator, we owed GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 million in fees for services previously provided to
us; of which $0.3 million has been paid by us. GSCP (NJ), L.P. agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining $2.6 million in connection
with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report.
The terms of the investment advisory and management
agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, our current investment adviser, are substantially similar to the terms of the investment
advisory and management agreement we had entered into with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser, except for the following material
distinctions in the fee terms:
●
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from May 31, 2010, and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors and, as a result, Saratoga Investment Advisors will be entitled to 20.0% of net gains that arise after May 31, 2010. In addition, the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 equal the fair value of such investment as of such date. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P., the capital gains fee was calculated from March 21, 2007, and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses.
●
Under the “catch up” provision, 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds 1.875% but is less than or equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors. This will enable Saratoga Investment Advisors to receive 20.0% of all net investment income as such amount approaches 2.344% in any quarter, and Saratoga Investment Advisors will receive 20.0% of any additional net investment income. Under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P. only received 20.0% of the excess net investment income over 1.875%.
●
We will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than 7.5% for the preceding four fiscal quarters.
Capital Gains Incentive Fee
The Company records an expense accrual relating
to the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to its Manager when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized
capital losses on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Manager if the Company were to
liquidate its investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to the Company’s Manager related to capital gains
will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference
Rate Reform
(“ASU 2020-04”). The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP
to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The Company
has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies and under the Encina Credit Facility. Many of these
agreements (including the credit agreements relating to the Encina Credit Facility) include an alternative successor rate or language
for choosing an alternative successor rate when LIBOR reference is no longer considered to be appropriate. With respect to other agreements,
the Company intends to work with its portfolio companies to modify agreements to choose an alternative successor rate. Contract modifications
are required to be evaluated in determining whether the modifications result in the establishment of new contracts or the continuation
of existing contracts. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management does not believe this optional
guidance has a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

At November 30, 2022, our investment in the subordinated
notes of Saratoga CLO, a collateralized loan obligation fund, had a fair value of $19.4 million and constituted 2.0% of our portfolio.
This investment constitutes a first loss position in a portfolio that, as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, was composed
of
$653.3
million and $660.2 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of primarily
senior secured first lien term loans. In addition, as of November 30, 2022, we also own $9.4 million in aggregate principal of the F-2-R-3
Notes in the Saratoga CLO, which only rank senior to the subordinated notes.
This investment is subject to unique risks. (See
Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors—“Our investment in Saratoga CLO constitutes a leveraged investment in a portfolio of predominantly
senior secured first lien term loans and is subject to additional risks and volatility” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended February 28, 2022).
We do not consolidate the Saratoga CLO portfolio
in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the metrics below do not include the underlying Saratoga CLO portfolio investments.
However, at November 30, 2022,
$574.7 million or 96.9%
of the Saratoga CLO portfolio investments
in terms of market value had a CMR (as defined below) color rating of green or yellow. At February 28, 2022, $630.3 million or 98.7%
of the Saratoga CLO portfolio investments in terms of market value had a CMR color rating of green or yellow and two Saratoga CLO portfolio
investments were in default with a fair value of $2.8 million. For more information relating to the Saratoga CLO, see the audited financial
statements for Saratoga in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022.
Saratoga Investment Advisors normally grades all
of our investments using a credit and monitoring rating system (“CMR”). The CMR consists of a single component: a color rating.
The color rating is based on several criteria, including financial and operating strength, probability of default, and restructuring risk.
The color ratings are characterized as follows: (Green)—performing credit; (Yellow)—underperforming credit; (Red)—in
principal payment default and/or expected loss of principal.
Portfolio CMR distribution
The CMR distribution for our investments at November 30,
2022 and February 28, 2022 was as follows:

For the three months ended November 30, 2022, total
operating expenses increased $5.0 million, or 44.5%, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. For the nine months ended November
30, 2022, total operating expenses increased $3.6 million, or 9.6%, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
For the
three months ended November 30, 2022, interest and debt financing expenses increased $3.6 million, or 74.5%, compared to the three months
ended November 30, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average outstanding debt from $425.9 million for the
three months ended November 30, 2021 to $679.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, primarily reflecting (i) the issuance
of the 4.375% 2026 Notes and the 4.35% 2027 Notes during the year ended February 28, 2022, and (ii) the issuance of the 6.00% 2027 Notes
and the 8.00% 2027 Notes during the three months ended November 30, 2022.
For the
nine months ended November 30, 2022, interest and debt financing expenses increased $8.9 million, or 61.8%, compared to the nine months
ended November 30, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average outstanding debt from $378.3 million for the
nine months ended November 30, 2021 to $476.3 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, primarily reflecting (i) the issuance
of the 4.375% 2026 Notes and the 4.35% 2027 Notes during the year ended February 28, 2022, and (ii) the issuance of the 6.00% 2027 Notes
and the 8.00% 2027 Notes during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
For the three
and nine months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was
4.43% and 3.98%, respectively and 5.74% and 4.24%, respectively. The decrease in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven
by the issuance of the lower-rate 4.375% 2026 Notes and 4.35% 2026 Notes, the redemption of the 6.25% 2025 Notes, the redemption of the
7.25% 2027 Notes and the issuance of lower cost SBA debentures over the past year.
As of November
30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the SBA debentures represented 34.6% and 36.2% of overall debt, respectively.
For the three
months ended November 30, 2022, base management fees increased $1.3 million, or 45.7%, from $3.0 million to $4.3 million compared to
the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in base management fees results from the 45.7% increase in the average value of
our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $670.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021 to $976.1 million for
the three months ended November 30, 2022. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, base management fees increased $3.4 million, or
40.1%, from $8.7 million to $12.2 million compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in base management fees results
from the 40.1% increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents, from $658.7 million for the nine months
ended November 30, 2021 to $922.6 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
For the
three months ended November 30, 2022, incentive management fees decreased $0.9 million, or 36.7%, compared to the three months ended
November 30, 2021. The incentive fee on income increased from $1.5 million to $2.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021
and 2022. The incentive fee on capital gains decreased from a $0.9 million expense for the three months ended November 30, 2021 to a
$(0.8) million benefit for the three months ended November 30, 2022, both reflecting the incentive fee income on net unrealized appreciation
and depreciation recognized during both these periods.
For the nine months ended November
30, 2022, incentive management fees decreased $9.5 million, or 97.8%, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The incentive
fee on income decreased from $4.8 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021 to $4.0 million for the nine months ended November
30, 2022, reflecting the Company’s net investment income being below the hurdle based on net asset value for incentive fee purposes
for part of the nine months. The incentive fee on capital gains decreased from a $4.9 million expense for the nine months ended November
30, 2021 to a $(3.7) million benefit for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, both reflecting the incentive fee income on net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation recognized during both these periods.
For the three and nine months ended November 30,
2022, professional fees increased $0.7 million, or 74.5%, and increased $0.5 million, or 55.7%, respectively, compared to the three and
nine months ended November 30, 2021.
For the three and nine months ended November 30,
2022, administrator expenses increased $0.07 million, or 634.8%, and increased $0.5 million or 55.7% compared to the three and nine
months ended November 30, 2022.
124

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We intend to continue to generate cash primarily
from cash flows from operations, including interest earned from our investments in debt in middle market companies, interest earned from
the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high- quality debt investments that mature in one year or less,
the Encina Credit Facility, our continued access to the SBA debentures, future borrowings and future offerings of debt and equity securities.
Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment
portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and our
equity ATM program, and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure
you that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has historically traded at a price below
our current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per
share, we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.
In addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders
substantially all of our operating taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code.
In satisfying this distribution requirement, in accordance with certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations
and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as
fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or
stock of the RIC subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20%
of the aggregate declared distribution. We may rely on the revenue procedure in future periods to satisfy our RIC distribution requirement.
Also, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet
a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities,
which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200.0%, reduced to 150.0% effective April 16, 2019
following the approval received from the board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, on April 16, 2018. This
requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 173.2% as of November 30,
2022 and 209.3% as of February 28, 2022. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional
capital from various sources, including the equity markets and other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable
terms, if at all.
Consequently, we may not have the funds or the
ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio
companies, to pay dividends or to repay borrowings. Also, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to
sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded
value.
Due to the diverse capital sources available to
us at this time, we believe we have adequate liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. As the impact of COVID-19 continues
to evolve, we will continually evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on the
current circumstances. This “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section should be read in conjunction with
“Recent COVID-19 Developments” above, as well as with the notes of our consolidated financial statements.
Madison Revolving Credit Facility
The senior secured revolving credit facility we
entered into with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the “Madison Credit Facility”) on June 30, 2010, was most recently amended
on September 3, 2021 and then fully repaid and terminated on October 4, 2021.
Encina Credit Facility
Below is a summary of the terms of the senior
secured revolving credit facility we entered into with Encina Lender Finance, LLC on October 4, 2021.
Commitment . The Company entered into a
senior secured revolving credit facility in the initial facility amount of $50.0 million (the “Facility Amount”). The Company
has the ability to request an increase in the Facility Amount during the first two years following the closing date to up to $75.0 million.
The commitment termination date is October 4, 2024.
129
Availability . The Company can draw up to
the lesser of (i) the Facility Amount and (ii) the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is an amount equal to (i) the difference of (A)
the product of the applicable advance rate which varies from 50.0% to 75.0% depending on the type of loan asset (Defaulted Loans being
excluded in that they carry an advance rate of 0%) and the value, determined in accordance with the Encina Credit Facility (the “Adjusted
Borrowing Value”), of certain “eligible” loan assets pledged as security for the loan (the “Borrowing Base Value”)
and (B) the Excess Concentration Amount, as calculated in accordance with the Encina Credit Facility, plus (ii) any amounts held in the
Prefunding Account and, without duplication, Excess Cash held in the Collection Account, less (iii) the product of (a) the amount of any
undrawn funding commitments the Company has under any loan asset and (b) the Unfunded Exposure Haircut Percentage, and less (iv) $100,000.
Each loan asset held by the Company as of the date on which the Encina Credit Facility was closed was valued as of that date and each
loan asset that the Company acquires after such date will be valued at the lowest of its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued
interest) and the purchase price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other
things and under certain circumstances, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency of the obligor,
acceleration of the loan asset, and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset.
The Encina Credit Facility contains limitations
on the type of loan assets that are “eligible” to be included in the Borrowing Base and as to the concentration level of certain
categories of loan assets in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, asset size and quality,
payment frequency, status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In addition, if an asset is to remain an “eligible”
loan asset, the Company may not make changes to the payment, amortization, collateral and certain other terms of the loan assets without
the consent of the administrative agent that will either result in subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the lenders.
The Encina Credit Facility requires certain minimum
drawn amounts. For the period beginning on the closing date and ended April 4, 2022, the minimum funding amount was $12.5 million. For
the period beginning on April 5, 2022 through maturity, the minimum funding amount is the greater of $25.0 million and 50% of the Facility
Amount in effect from time to time.
Collateral . The Encina Credit Facility
is secured by assets of Saratoga Investment Funding II LLC (“SIF II”) and pledged to the lender under the credit facility.
SIF II is a wholly owned special purpose entity formed by the Company for the purpose of entering into the Encina Credit Facility.
Interest Rate and Fees.
Under the Encina
Credit Facility, funds are borrowed from or through certain lenders at the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rate and 0.75%, plus an applicable
margin of 4.00%. The Encina Credit Facility includes benchmark replacement provisions which permit the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
to select a replacement rate upon the unavailability of LIBOR. In addition, the Company pays the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75% per
year (or 0.50% if the ratio of advances outstanding to aggregate commitments is greater than or equal to 50%) on the unused amount of
the Encina Credit Facility for the duration of the term of the credit facility. Accrued interest and commitment fees are payable monthly
in arrears. The Company was also obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the Encina Credit
Facility.
Collateral Tests . It is a condition precedent
to any borrowing under the Encina Credit Facility that the principal amount outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility, after giving
effect to the proposed borrowings, not exceed the Borrowing Base (the “Borrowing Base Test”). In addition to satisfying the
Borrowing Base Test, the following tests must also be satisfied (together with Borrowing Base Test, the “Collateral Tests”):
○
Interest Coverage Ratio.
The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of interest collections with respect to pledged loan assets, less certain fees and expenses relating to the Encina Credit Facility, to accrued interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the Encina Credit Facility for the last 6 payment periods must equal at least 175.0%.
○
Overcollateralization Ratio.
The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of “eligible” pledged loan assets plus the fair value of certain ineligible pledged loan assets (in each case, subject to certain adjustments) to outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility plus the Unfunded Exposure Amount must equal at least 200.0%.
130
The Encina Credit Facility also may require payment
of outstanding borrowings or replacement of pledged loan assets upon the Company’s breach of its representation and warranty that
pledged loan assets included in the Borrowing Base are “eligible” loan assets. Such ineligible collateral loans will be excluded
from the calculation of the Borrowing Base and may lead to a Borrowing Base Deficiency, which may be cured by effecting one or more (or
any combination thereof) of the following actions: (A) deposit into or credit to the collection account cash and eligible investments,
(B) repay outstanding borrowings (together with certain costs and expenses), (C) sell or substitute loan assets in accordance with the
Encina Credit Facility, or (D) pledge additional loan assets as collateral. Compliance with the Collateral Tests is also a condition to
the discretionary sale of pledged loan assets by the Company.
Priority of Payments . The priority of payments
provisions of the Encina Credit Facility require, after payment of specified fees and expenses, that collections of interest from the
loan assets and, to the extent that these are insufficient, collections of principal from the loan assets, be applied on each payment
date to payment of outstanding borrowings if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio
would not otherwise be met.
Operating Expenses . The priority of payments
provision of the Encina Credit Facility provides for the payment of certain operating expenses of the Company out of collections on interest
and principal in accordance with the priority established in such provision. The operating expenses payable pursuant to the priority of
payment provisions is limited to $200,000 per annum.
Covenants; Representations and Warranties;
Events of Default . The Encina Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants
and events of default. The Encina Credit Facility does not contain grace periods for breach by the Company of any negative covenants or
of certain of the affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, those related to preservation of the existence and separateness
of the Company. Other events of default under the Encina Credit Facility include, among other things, the following:
○
failure of the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio of less than 175.0%;
○
failure of the Company to maintain an Overcollateralization Ratio of less than 200.0%;
○
the filing of certain ERISA or tax liens on assets of the Company or the Equityholder;
○
failure by Specified Holders to collectively, directly or indirectly, own and control at least 51% of the outstanding equity interests of Saratoga Investment Advisor, or (y) possess the right to elect (through contract, ownership of voting securities or otherwise) at all times a majority of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of Saratoga Investment Advisor and to direct the management policies and decisions of Saratoga Investment Advisor, or (ii) the dissolution, termination or liquidation in whole or in part, transfer or other disposition, in each case, of all or substantially all of the assets of, Saratoga Investment Advisor;
○
indictment or conviction of Saratoga Investment Advisors or any “key person” for a felony offense, or any fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by Saratoga Investment Advisors or any “key person” and, in the case of “key persons,” without a reputable, experienced individual reasonably satisfactory to Encina Lender Finance appointed to replace such key person within 30 days;
○
resignation, termination, disability or death of a “key person” or failure of any “key person” to provide active participation in Saratoga Investment Advisors’ daily activities, all without a reputable, experienced individual reasonably satisfactory to Encina Lender Finance appointed within 30 days.
Fees and Expenses . The Company paid certain
fees and reimbursed Encina Lender Finance, LLC for the aggregate amount of all documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, incurred by Encina Lender Finance, LLC in connection with the Encina Credit Facility and
the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated thereunder up to and as of the date of closing. These amounts totaled $1.4 million.
As of November 30, 2022, we had $25.0 million
outstanding borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility and $242.6 million of SBA- guaranteed debentures outstanding (which are discussed
below).
131
SBA-guaranteed debentures
In addition, we, through three wholly owned subsidiaries,
sought and obtained licenses from the SBA to operate an SBIC. In this regard, on March 28, 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary, Saratoga
Investment Corp. SBIC LP, received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958. On August 14, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP, also received a license. On September
29, 2022, our wholly owned subsidiary, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC III LP (“SBIC III LP”), also received an SBIC license
from the SBA. SBICs are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations,
SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.
The SBIC licenses allows our SBIC subsidiaries
to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest
payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior
to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis
at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.
The SBIC LP, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP are regulated
by the SBA. SBA regulations previously limited the amount that our SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has
at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA
subsequent to licensing. This maximum has been increased by SBA regulators for new licenses to $175.0 million of SBA debentures when it
has at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital. SBIC II LP’s SBIC license provides up to $175.0 million in additional long-term
capital in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBIC III LP’s SBIC license provides up to $175.0 million in additional long-term
capital in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures. Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum
amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed $350.0 million with at least $175.0 million in combined regulatory capital. Our wholly
owned SBIC subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which generally approximates equity capital
in the respective SBIC) and is subject to customary regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, a periodic examination by
the SBA. With the third license approval, Saratoga can grow its SBA relationship from $150.0 million to $350.0 million of committed capital.
We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit
us to exclude the senior securities issued by of our SBIC subsidiaries from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage
requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage requirement by
permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On April
16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our independent directors
approved of our becoming subject to a reduced minimum asset coverage ratio of 150.0% from 200% under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of
the 1940 Act. The 150% asset coverage ratio became effective on April 16, 2019.
As of November 30, 2022, SBIC LP had $75.0 million
in regulatory capital and $67.7 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, SBIC II LP had $87.5 million in regulatory capital and
$175.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and SBIC III LP subsidiary had $35.0 million in regulatory capital and $0.0 million
in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our business activities contain elements of market
risk. We consider our principal market risk to be the fluctuation in interest rates. Managing this risk is essential to our business.
Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and thresholds
and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and
processes. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have experienced a higher level of stress due to the global
COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in value of
the securities held by us.
Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity
of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, including relative changes in different interest rates, variability of
spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may
have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between
the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing debt and
liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire leveraged loans, high yield bonds and
other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio.
Our investment income is affected by fluctuations
in various interest rates, including LIBOR, SOFR or BSBY and the prime rate. Substantially all of our portfolio is, and we expect will
continue to be, comprised of floating rate investments that utilize LIBOR, SOFR or BSBY.
Since March
2022, the Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates and has indicated that it would consider additional rate hikes in response
to ongoing inflation concerns.  In a rising interest rate environment,
our cost of funds
would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by
our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle could result the United States into a recession,
which would likely decrease interest rates.  A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income
and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such floating rates, are not offset by corresponding
increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease
in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. Our interest expense is affected by fluctuations in LIBOR only on our Encina Credit
Facility. In addition, substantially all of our assets and our Encina Credit Facility have LIBOR transition language to include the use
of an acceptable replacement rate, such as SOFR or BSBY. At November 30, 2022, we had $676.2 million of borrowings outstanding. In addition,
there were $25.0 million borrowings outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility as of November 30, 2022.
We have analyzed the potential impact of changes
in interest rates on interest income from investments. Assuming that our investments as of November 30, 2022 were to remain constant for
a full fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the current interest rate terms, a hypothetical change of a 1.0% increase in interest
rates would cause a corresponding increase of approximately $8.6 million to our interest income. Conversely, a hypothetical change of
a 1.0% decrease in interest rates would cause a corresponding decrease of approximately $8.6 million to our interest income.
Changes in interest rates would have no impact
to our current interest and debt financing expense, as all our borrowings, except for the Encina Credit Facility, are fixed rate.
Although management believes that this measure
is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition
of the assets on the statements of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could magnify or diminish our sensitivity
to interest rate changes, nor does it account for divergences in LIBOR and the commercial paper rate, which have historically moved in
tandem but, in times of unusual credit dislocations, have experienced periods of divergence. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that
actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in facilitating timely decisions regarding required disclosure of any material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
(b)
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

All or a portion of this investment has an unfunded commitment as of November 30, 2022. (See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
Percentages are based on net assets of $335,763,600 as of November 30, 2022.
Securities are exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are restricted securities.
Because there is no readily available market value for these investments, the fair values of these investments were determined using significant unobservable inputs and approved in good faith by our board of directors. These investments have been included as Level 3 in the Fair Value Hierarchy (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
Includes securities issued by an affiliate of the company.
This investment does not have a stated interest rate that is payable thereon. As a result, the 0.00% interest rate in the table above represents the effective interest rate currently earned on the investment cost and is based on the current cash interest and other income generated by the investment.
Represents an investment that is not a "qualifying asset" under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act"). As of November 30, 2022, non-qualifying assets represent 8.6% of the Company's portfolio at fair value. As a BDC, the Company generally has to invest at least 70% of its total assets in qualifying assets.
As defined in the 1940 Act, we "control" this portfolio company because we own more than 25% of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities. Transactions during the nine months ended November 30, 2022 in which the issuer was both an affiliate and a portfolio company that we control are as follows:
Non-income producing at November 30, 2022.
These securities are either fully or partially pledged as collateral under a senior secured revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
As of November 30, 2022, the investment was on non-accrual status. The fair value of these investments was approximately $9.7 million, which represented 2.9% of the Company's portfolio (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
As defined in the 1940 Act, this portfolio company is an "affiliate" as we own between 5.0% and 25.0% of the outstanding voting securities. Transactions during the nine months ended November 30, 2022 in which the issuer was an affiliate are as follows:
Included within cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents, reserve accounts in the Company's consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of February 28, 2022.
The Company’s equity investment in SLF JV is measured using the proportionate share of the net asset value, or equivalent, as a practical expedient and thus has not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Included within cash and cash equivalents in Saratoga CLO’s Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of February 28, 2022.
As of February 28, 2022, the investment was in default and on non-accrual status.
All or a portion of this investment has an unfunded commitment as of February 28, 2022
Represents the dilutive effect of issuing common stock below net asset value per share during the period in connection with the satisfaction of the Company’s annual RIC distribution requirement and may include the impact of the different share amounts used for different items (weighted average basic common shares outstanding for the corresponding year and actual common shares outstanding at the end of the year) in the per common share data calculation and rounding impacts. See Note 13, Dividend.
Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common shares at the current net asset value on the first day and a sale at the current net asset value on the last day of the periods reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Company’s DRIP. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage commissions.
The continuous issuance of common stock may cause an incremental increase in net asset value per share due to the sale of shares at the then prevailing public offering price and the receipt of net proceeds per share by the Company in excess of net asset value per share on each subscription closing date. The per share data was derived by computing (i) the sum of (A) the number of shares issued in connection with subscriptions and/or distribution reinvestment on each share transaction date multiplied by (B) the differences between the net proceeds per share and the net asset value per share on each share transaction date, divided by (ii) the total shares outstanding during the period.
Represents the anti-dilutive impact on the net asset value per share (“NAV”) of the Company due to the repurchase of common shares. See Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity.
Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common shares at the current market value on the first day and a sale at the current market value on the last day of the periods reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Company’s DRIP. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage commissions.
The Revolving Credit Facility, SBA Debentures, 7.75% Notes Payable 2025, 4.375% Notes Payable, 6.00% Notes Payable 2025, 7.00% Notes Payable 2025 and 6.25% Notes Payable 2027 are not registered for public trading.
