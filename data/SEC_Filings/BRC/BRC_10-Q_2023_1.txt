Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Brady Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Brady," "we," or "our") without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of the Company, the foregoing statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, its results of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2022, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from the estimates. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022. NOTE B —
New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted Standards In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires contract assets and contract liabilities (e.g. deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. The guidance is applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2021-08 during the quarter ended October 31, 2022. The adoption of the new standard will only have an impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements in the event of future acquisitions. NOTE C —

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges, and the unamortized gain on post-retirement plans, net of their related tax effects. 10 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the six months ended January 31, 2023: Unrealized gain on cash flow hedges Unamortized gain on post-retirement plans Foreign currency translation adjustments Accumulated other comprehensive loss Beginning balance, July 31, 2022 $ 954   $ 1,436   $ ( 111,467 ) $ ( 109,077 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification 1,593   —   12,890   14,483   Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 598 ) ( 178 ) —   ( 776 ) Ending balance, January 31, 2023 $ 1,949   $ 1,258   $ ( 98,577 ) $ ( 95,370 ) The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 31, 2023 compared to July 31, 2022 was primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain other currencies during the six-month period. The foreign currency translation adjustments column in the table above includes the impact of foreign currency translation, foreign currency translation on intercompany notes, and the settlements of net investment hedges, net of tax. The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, for the six months ended January 31, 2022 were as follows: Unrealized gain on cash flow hedges Unamortized gain on post-retirement plans Foreign currency translation adjustments Accumulated other comprehensive loss Beginning balance, July 31, 2021 $ 729   $ 1,888   $ ( 58,570 ) $ ( 55,953 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassification ( 142 ) ( 60 ) ( 22,141 ) ( 22,343 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 453 ) ( 190 ) —   ( 643 ) Ending balance, January 31, 2022 $ 134   $ 1,638   $ ( 80,711 ) $ ( 78,939 ) The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 31, 2022, compared to July 31, 2021, was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain other currencies during the six-month period.
Of the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, unrealized gains on cash flow hedges were reclassified to "Cost of goods sold" and unamortized gains on post-retirement plans were reclassified into "Investment and other income" on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value Measurements In accordance with fair value accounting guidance, the Company determines fair value based on the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: Level 1
— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that are accessible as of the reporting date. Level 2
— Other significant pricing inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable. Level 3
— Significant unobservable pricing inputs, which result in the use of management's own assumptions. 13 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022:   January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Fair Value Hierarchy Assets: Deferred compensation plan assets $ 17,558   $ 18,037   Level 1 Foreign exchange contracts 1,591   489   Level 2 Liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts ( 116 ) 32   Level 2 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: Deferred compensation plan assets:
The Company’s deferred compensation investments consist of investments in mutual funds, which are included in "Other assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These investments were classified as Level 1 as the shares of these investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Foreign exchange contracts:
The Company’s foreign exchange contracts were classified as Level 2 as the fair value was based on the present value of the future cash flows using external models that use observable inputs, such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates. See Note K, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” for additional information. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other liabilities approximated carrying values due to their short-term nature.
NOTE K —
Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company utilizes forward foreign exchange currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk of specific foreign currency denominated transactions. These contracts typically require the exchange of a foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a fixed rate on a future date, with maturities of less than
18
months, which qualify as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges under the accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The primary objective of the Company’s foreign currency exchange risk management program is to minimize the impact of currency movements due to transactions in other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency and to minimize the impact of currency movements on the Company’s net investment denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges a portion of known exposures using forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
Main foreign currency exposures are related to transactions denominated in the British Pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican Peso, Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore dollar. Generally, these risk management transactions will involve the use of foreign currency derivatives to minimize the impact of currency movements on non-functional currency transactions.
The U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of outstanding forward exchange contracts were as follows: January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Designated as cash flow hedges $ 12,651   $ 25,276   Non-designated hedges 4,456   4,057   Total foreign exchange contracts $ 17,107   $ 29,333   Cash Flow Hedges The Company has designated a portion of its forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and recorded these contracts at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For these instruments, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, unrealized gains of $ 1,911
and $ 1,040
have been included in OCI, respectively. 14 Table of Contents Net Investment Hedges The Company has designated certain third party foreign currency denominated debt borrowed under its credit agreement as net investment hedges. These debt obligations, denominated in Euros and British Pounds, were designated as net investment hedges to hedge portions of the Company's net investment in its European operations. The Company’s foreign currency denominated debt obligations are valued under a market approach using publicized spot prices, and the net gains or losses attributable to the changes in spot prices are recorded as cumulative translation within AOCI and are included in the foreign currency translation adjustments section of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the cumulative balance recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income were losses of $ 841
and $ 0 , respectively, on any outstanding foreign currency denominated debt obligations. The following table summarizes the amount of pre-tax gains and losses related to derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31,    2023 2022 2023 2022 Gains (losses) recognized in OCI: Forward exchange contracts (cash flow hedges) $ 776   $ 225   $ 1,669   $ 199   Foreign currency denominated debt (net investment hedges) ( 841 ) —   ( 841 ) —   Gains reclassified from OCI into cost of goods sold Forward exchange contracts (cash flow hedges) 217   36   798   604   Fair values of derivative instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows:   January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Prepaid expenses and other current assets Other current liabilities Long-term obligations Prepaid expenses and other current assets Other current liabilities Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts (cash flow hedges) $ 1,564   ( 116 ) —  $ 489   $ 30   Foreign currency denominated debt (net investment hedges) —  —  ( 38,981 ) —  —  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts (non-designated hedges) 27   —   —  —   2   Total derivative instruments $ 1,591   ( 116 ) ( 38,981 ) $ 489   $ 32   NOTE L —

Subsequent Events Effective February 1, 2023, the Company announced a modification of its organizational structure under new regional operating segments. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company will report sales and segment profit based on the following two operating segments: Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia. On
February 21, 2023 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of the Company’s Class A and Class B Common Stock of $ 0.23
per share payable on
April 28, 2023 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on
April 10, 2023 . 15 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Brady Corporation is a global manufacturer and supplier of identification solutions and workplace safety products that identify and protect premises, products and people. The IDS segment is primarily involved in the design, manufacture, and distribution of high-performance and innovative identification and healthcare products. The WPS segment manufactures a broad range of stock and custom identification products and sells a broad range of resale products. The ability to provide customers with a broad range of proprietary, customized and diverse products for use in various applications across multiple industries and geographies, along with a commitment to quality and service, have made Brady a leader in many of its markets. Brady's long-term sales growth and profitability will depend not only on the overall economic environment and our ability to successfully navigate changes in the macro environment, but also on our ability to develop and market innovative new products, deliver a high level of customer service, advance our digital capabilities, and continuously improve the efficiency of our global operations. In our IDS business, our strategy for growth includes an increased focus on certain industries and products, a focus on improving the customer buying experience, and the development of technologically advanced, innovative and proprietary products. In our WPS business, our strategy for growth includes a focus on workplace safety critical industries, streamlining our product offerings, enhancing our compliance and customization expertise, improving our price competitiveness, and improving our digital capabilities. The following are key initiatives supporting our strategy in fiscal 2023: • Investing in organic growth by enhancing our research and development process and utilizing customer feedback and observations to develop innovative new products that solve customer needs and improve environmental sustainability. • Providing our customers with the highest level of customer service. • Expanding and enhancing our sales capabilities through an improved digital presence and the use of data-driven marketing automation tools. • Maintaining profitability through pricing mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures while ensuring prices are market competitive. • Investing in acquisitions that enhance our strategic position and accelerate long-term sales growth and profitability. • Driving operational excellence and executing sustainable efficiency gains within our selling, general and administrative structures and within our global operations including insourcing of critical products and manufacturing activities while reducing our environmental footprint and managing working capital. • Building on our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion to increase employee engagement and enhance recruitment and retention practices in order to drive differentiated performance and execute our strategy. • Executing our reorganization to a regional operating structure to support continued growth in key geographies, facilitate new product development in our recent acquisitions, and simplify and further integrate our businesses. Macroeconomic Conditions and Trends The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, inflationary pressures; labor shortages in certain geographies; supply chain and other business disruptions as a result of the conflict in Ukraine; as well as disruptions caused by COVID-19 and government-mandated actions in response to COVID-19, particularly in China. The Company has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate inflation issues through pricing actions and the execution of sustainable efficiency gains. We believe we have the financial strength to continue to invest in organic sales growth opportunities including sales, marketing, and research and development ("R&D") and inorganic sales opportunities including acquisitions, while continuing to drive sustainable efficiency gains and automation in our operations and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") functions. At January 31, 2023, we had cash of $108.2 million, as well as a credit agreement with $221.1 million available for future borrowing, which can be increased up to $981.1 million at the Company's option and subject to certain conditions, for total available liquidity of $1,089.3 million. We believe that our financial resources and liquidity levels, including the remaining undrawn amount of our credit agreement and our ability to increase our credit line as necessary, are sufficient to manage the impact of economic or geopolitical events which may result in reduced sales, reduced net income, and reduced cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Risk Factors, included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, for further discussion of the potential impact of global economic or geopolitical events or the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations A comparison of results of operating income for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows: Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 %

The Company's organic sales disclosures exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying sales trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods. Net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023 increased 2.6% to $326.2 million, compared to $318.1 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase consisted of organic sales growth of 6.3%, which was partially offset by a decrease from foreign currency translation of 3.7%. Organic sales grew 7.4% in the IDS segment and 2.8% in the WPS segment during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2023 increased 1.5% to $648.8 million, compared to $639.5 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase consisted of organic sales growth of 6.6%, which was partially offset by a decrease from foreign currency translation of 5.1%. Organic sales increased 8.0% in the IDS segment and 2.0% in the WPS segment during the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross margin increased 4.7% to $156.4 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $149.4 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 48.0% from 47.0% in the three-month period. Gross margin increased 2.4% to $311.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $304.4 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 48.0% from 47.6% in the six-month period. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our ongoing efforts to streamline manufacturing processes to drive sustainable operating efficiencies as well as price increases, which were partially offset by an increase in the cost of materials and labor. R&D expenses increased 10.1% to $15.4 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $14.0 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 4.7% from 4.4% in the three-month period. R&D expenses increased 5.2% to $29.3 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $27.9 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased slightly to 4.5% from 4.4% in the six-month period. The Company remains committed to investing in new product development to increase sales within our IDS and WPS businesses. Investments in new printers, materials and the build out of industrial track and trace solutions remain the primary focus of R&D expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses include selling and administrative costs directly attributed to the IDS and WPS segments, as well as certain other corporate administrative expenses including finance, information technology, human resources, and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses decreased 0.3% to $92.3 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $92.5 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 28.3% from 29.1% in the three-month period. SG&A expenses decreased 3.7% to $182.2 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $189.3 million in the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 28.1% from 29.6% in the six-month period. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the three and six-month periods ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, reductions in catalog advertising expenses within the WPS segment. Operating income increased 13.8% to $48.8 million and increased 14.9% to $100.2 million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $42.9 million and $87.2 million in the same periods in the prior year. The
17 Table of Contents increase in operating income in both the three and six-month periods was primarily due to the increase in segment profit in the IDS segment as a result of organic sales growth, and an increase in segment profit in the WPS segment due to its reduced cost structure.

The increase in income during the three and six-month periods was primarily due to an increase in the market value of securities held in deferred compensation plans and to a lesser extent an increase in interest income. Interest expense increased to $1.2 million and $2.1 million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $0.3 million and $0.4 million in the same periods in the prior year. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in benchmark interest rates compared to the same periods in the prior year. The Company's income tax rate was 21.7% and 19.6% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the income tax rate was 21.7% and 20.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to Note L, "Income Taxes" for additional information on the Company's income tax rates. Business Segment Operating Results The Company evaluates short-term segment performance based on segment profit and customer sales. Interest expense, investment and other income (expense), income tax expense, and certain corporate administrative expenses are excluded when evaluating segment performance. 18 Table of Contents The following is a summary of segment information for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 SALES GROWTH INFORMATION IDS Organic 7.4  % 16.0  % 8.0  % 14.6  % Currency (3.0) % (1.7) % (4.3) % (0.5) % Acquisitions —  % 11.8  % —  % 11.7  % Total 4.4  % 26.1  % 3.7  % 25.8  % WPS Organic 2.8  % 5.2  % 2.0  % (2.0) % Currency (6.2) % (3.2) % (8.3) % (1.1) % Total (3.4) % 2.0  % (6.3) % (3.1) % Total Company Organic 6.3  % 13.1  % 6.6  % 10.0  % Currency (3.7) % (2.1) % (5.1) % (0.7) % Acquisitions —  % 8.6  % —  % 8.5  % Total 2.6  % 19.6  % 1.5  % 17.8  % SEGMENT PROFIT IDS $ 47,384  $ 44,129  $ 98,909  $ 92,945  WPS 6,249  4,515  12,627  6,808  Total $ 53,633  $ 48,644  $ 111,536  $ 99,753  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES IDS 18.5  % 18.0  % 19.3  % 18.8  % WPS 8.9  % 6.2  % 9.2  % 4.7  % Total 16.4  % 15.3  % 17.2  % 15.6  % IDS IDS net sales increased 4.4% to $255.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $245.0 million in the same period in the prior year, which consisted of organic sales growth of 7.4% and a decrease from foreign currency translation of 3.0%.

The organic sales declines in China were partially offset by strong sales growth in India and Japan during both the three and six-month periods.

19 Table of Contents January 31, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in segment profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to ongoing efforts to streamline processes to drive operational efficiencies as well as price increases, which were partially offset by an increase in costs due to inflationary pressures. WPS WPS net sales declined 3.4% to $70.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $73.1 million in the same period in the prior year, which consisted of organic sales growth of 2.8% and a decrease from foreign currency translation of 6.2%.

Organic sales in Australia increased in the mid-teens in both the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Organic sales were driven by consistent growth in both digital and sales from all other channels, including catalogs, in both the three and six-month periods, which was primarily the result of price increases implemented throughout the six months ended January 31, 2023. Segment profit increased 38.4% to $6.2 million from $4.5 million, and as a percentage of net sales, segment profit increased to 8.9% from 6.2% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year.

The increase in segment profit for both periods was primarily due to actions taken during fiscal 2022 to reduce the cost structure as well as ongoing reductions in catalog advertising expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world. At January 31, 2023, approximately 99% of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held outside the United States. The Company's organic and inorganic growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. The Company believes that its cash flow from operating activities and its borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, common stock repurchases, and dividend payments for the next 12 months and beyond. Although the Company believes these sources of cash are currently sufficient to fund domestic operations, annual cash needs could require repatriation of cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in additional tax payments. 20 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $108.2 million at January 31, 2023, a decrease of $5.9 million from July 31, 2022. The significant changes were as follows:   Six months ended January 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 57,384  $ 24,328  Investing activities (8,156) (16,381) Financing activities (57,128) (4,505) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 2,041  (3,370) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (5,859) $ 72  Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $24.3 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to reduced inventory purchases compared to increased inventory purchases in the prior year in order to reduce the risk of supply chain disruption. Net cash used in investing activities was $8.2 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $16.4 million in the same period of the prior year, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures in both periods. Prior year capital expenditures were elevated due to the purchase of two facilities that were previously leased. Net cash used in financing activities was $57.1 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $4.5 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to $17.7 million of net repayments on the credit agreement in the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $45.0 million of net borrowings on the credit agreement in the same period of the prior year, which was due to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the current six-month period. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, borrowings on our credit agreement and lease obligations. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items over the next 12 months and in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current and anticipated customer needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions, but we do not believe that the cash requirements to meet any of these liabilities will be material. Credit Agreement On August 1, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured $200 million multi-currency credit agreement with a group of five banks. On December 21, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the credit agreement dated August 1, 2019. The amendment modified the credit agreement to, among other things, (a) change the interest rate under the credit agreement for borrowings (i) denominated in British Pounds from the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") to a daily simple SONIA-based rate, (ii) denominated in Euro from a LIBOR-based rate to a rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate and (iii) denominated in Japanese Yen from a LIBOR-based rate to a rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, in each of the foregoing cases subject to certain adjustments specified in the credit agreement; and (b) provide mechanics relating to a transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR (with respect to borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars) and the designated benchmarks for the other eligible currencies as benchmark interest rates and the replacement of any such benchmark by a replacement benchmark rate. The amendment to the credit agreement did not have a material impact on the interest rate or related balances in the Company's consolidated financial statements. On November 14, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”) with a group of six banks, which amended the original credit agreement dated August 1, 2019. Amendment No. 2 amended the credit agreement to, among other items, (a) increase the lending commitments by $100 million for total lending commitments of $300 million, (b) extend the final maturity date to November 14, 2027, (c) increase the
21 Table of Contents interest rate on certain borrowings by 0.125%, and (d) increase the available amount under the credit agreement, at the Company's option and subject to certain conditions, from $300 million up to (i) an amount equal to the incremental borrowing necessary to bring the Company's consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined in the credit agreement to 2.5 to 1.0 plus (ii) $200 million. Borrowings under Amendment No. 2 are unsecured and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Company's credit agreement was $77.3 million. The maximum amount outstanding on the credit agreement during the six months ended January 31, 2023 was $103.0 million. As of January 31, 2023, the U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings of $38.3 million bear interest at 5.6%; the Euro-denominated borrowings of €20.0 million bear interest at 2.9%; and the British Pound-denominated borrowings of £17.3 million bear interest at 4.3% for a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. The Company had letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement of $1.6 million as of January 31, 2023, and there was $221.1 million available for future borrowing, which can be increased to $981.1 million at the Company's option, subject to certain conditions. The credit agreement has a final maturity date of November 14, 2027. As such, borrowings were classified as long-term on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Covenant Compliance The Company's credit agreement requires it to maintain certain financial covenants, including a ratio of debt to the trailing twelve months EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, of not more than a 3.5 to 1.0 ratio (leverage ratio) and the trailing twelve months EBITDA to interest expense of not less than a 3.0 to 1.0 ratio (interest expense coverage). As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants, with a ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, equal to 0.31 to 1.0 and the interest expense coverage ratio equal to 85.9 to 1.0. Forward-Looking Statements In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, statements that are not reported financial results or other historic information are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the Company's future financial position, business strategy, targets, projected sales, costs, income, capital expenditures, debt levels and cash flows, and plans and objectives of management for future operations. The use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “should,” “project” or “plan” or similar terminology are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain and are subject to risks, assumptions, and other factors, some of which are beyond Brady's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For Brady, uncertainties arise from: • Increased cost of raw materials, labor and freight as well as raw material shortages and supply chain disruptions • Decreased demand for the Company's products • Ability to compete effectively or to successfully execute the Company's strategy • Ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands • Ability to identify, integrate, and grow acquired companies, and to manage contingent liabilities from divested businesses • Adverse impacts of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic or other pandemics • Difficulties in protecting websites, networks, and systems against security breaches and difficulties in preventing phishing attacks, social engineering or malicious break-ins • Risks associated with the loss of key employees • Extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities • Litigation, including product liability claims • Foreign currency fluctuations • Potential write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets • Changes in tax legislation and tax rates • Differing interests of voting and non-voting shareholders • Numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including major public health crises and government responses thereto and those of a political, economic, business, competitive, and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited to, those factors listed in the “Risk Factors” section within Item 1A of Part I of Brady's Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022. These uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Brady does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Brady Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s President & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 23 Table of Contents PART II.
