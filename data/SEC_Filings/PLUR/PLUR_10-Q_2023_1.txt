NOTE 1: - GENERAL
a.
Effective July 26, 2022, Pluri Inc.,
a Nevada corporation (“Pluri”), changed its name from Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. The Company also changed its symbol
on the Nasdaq Global Market and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange From “PSTI” to “PLUR”.
Pluri was incorporated on May 11, 2001. Pluri
has a wholly owned subsidiary, Pluri Biotech Ltd. (the “Subsidiary”), which is incorporated under the laws of the State
of Israel. In January 2020, the Subsidiary established a wholly owned subsidiary, Pluristem GmbH (the “German Subsidiary”)
which is incorporated under the laws of Germany. In January 2022, the Subsidiary established a subsidiary, Plurinuva Ltd. (“Plurinuva”)
which is incorporated under the laws of Israel, which followed the execution of the collaboration agreement with Tnuva Food Industries
– Agricultural Cooperative in Israel Ltd., through its fully owned subsidiary, Tnuva Food-Tech Incubator (2019), Limited Partnership
(“Tnuva”). Pluri, the Subsidiary, the German Subsidiary and Plurinuva are referred to as the “Company” or
“Pluri.” The Subsidiary, the German Subsidiary and Plurinuva are referred to as the “Subsidiaries.”
b.
The Company is a bio-technology company with an advanced cell-based
technology platform, which operates in one business segment. The Company has developed a unique three-dimensional (“3D”)
technology platform for cell expansion with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice cell manufacturing facility.
Pluri currently uses its technology in the field of regenerative medicine and food tech and plans to utilize it in other industries
and verticals that have a need for a mass scale and cost-effective cell expansion platform such as agri-tech and biologics. Pluri
is focused on the research, development and manufacturing of cell-based products, conducting clinical studies and the business development
of cell therapeutics and cell-based technologies providing potential solutions for various fields.
The Company has incurred an accumulated
deficit of approximately $ 385,501
and incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total shareholders’ equity amounted to $ 23,191 . During the six-month period ended
December 31, 2022, the Company incurred losses of $ 14,523
and its negative cash flow from operating activities was $ 13,889 .
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s
cash position (cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, restricted cash and restricted bank deposits) totaled $ 48,596 . The
Company plans to continue to finance its operations from its current resources, by entering into licensing or other commercial and collaboration
agreements, from grants to support its research and development activities, from sales of its equity securities and from the proceeds
received from the loan previously provided by the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”) (see also note 4). The Company’s
management believes that its current resources, and the rest of the funds it will receive from the investment agreements signed in December
together with its existing operating plan, are sufficient for the Company to meet its obligations as they come due at least for a period
of twelve months from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The Company also implemented a cost reduction
and efficiency plan to align with the change in its business strategy. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able
to obtain an adequate level of financial resources that are required for the long-term development and commercialization of its products.

c.
On January 5, 2022, the Subsidiary entered into definitive agreements (the “Agreements”) with Tnuva pursuant to which the Subsidiary and Tnuva established Plurinuva, with the purpose of developing cultured meat products. Plurinuva received exclusive, global, royalty bearing licensing rights to use Pluri’s proprietary technology, intellectual property and knowhow in the field of cultured meat. Tnuva invested $ 7,500  in Plurinuva and received
187,500
of Plurinuva’s ordinary shares, representing  15.79 % of the Plurinuva share capital as of February 24, 2022 (the “Closing Date”). In addition, Tnuva received warrants to invest up to an additional $ 7,500
over a period of twelve months following the Closing Date.
The first warrant (the “First
Warrant”) issued to Tnuva permits Tnuva to purchase up to  125,000  ordinary shares of Plurinuva at an exercise price of
$ 40.00  per share, and has a term commencing on the Closing Date and ending at the earlier of (i) six months from the Closing Date,
(ii) immediately prior to and subject to the consummation of an initial public offering or acquisition of Plurinuva or (iii) the consummation
of a financing round with a non-affiliated investor. In addition, on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, and provided that
the First Warrant has not expired, Plurinuva agreed to issue a second warrant (the “Second Warrant”) to Tnuva which will permit
Tnuva to purchase up to a number of ordinary shares of Plurinuva, or the then most senior securities issued by Plurinuva, in consideration
for such amount equal to  200 % of the remaining balance of the aggregate purchase price of the First Warrant, provided that Tnuva
exercises at least  62,500  ordinary shares at a price per share of $ 40.00 , or $ 2,500  in the aggregate, of the First Warrant.
The Second Warrant’s exercise price per share equals $ 76.00 . The Second Warrant has a term commencing on the six month anniversary
of the Closing Date and ending at the earlier of (i) six months from its issuance, (ii) immediately prior to and subject to the consummation
of an initial public offering or acquisition of Plurinuva or (iii) the consummation of a financing round with a non-affiliated investor.
The Company determined the fair value
of the ordinary shares and the warrants utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model (Level 3 classification), which incorporates various
assumptions including expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected date of a qualifying event. The Company
estimated the volatility of the ordinary shares of Plurinuva based on data from similar companies operating in the food tech field.
The consideration allocated to the shares
issued was divided between the non-controlling interests (“NCI”) and the Company’s shareholders as this transaction
is a transaction with the NCI.
The consideration allocated to the warrants
was recognized against the NCI.
On August 23, 2022, (“Amendment
Date”), Plurinuva and Tnuva executed an amendment to the warrant agreement (“Amendment”), extending the exercise period
of the First Warrant from six months to nine months from the Closing Date. All other terms remained unchanged.
Following the Amendment, the Company
recalculated the fair value of the warrants utilizing the same Monte Carlo simulation model (Level 3 classification) before and after
the Amendment Date, which incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the
expected date of a qualifying event.

NOTE 1: - GENERAL (CONT.)
The main assumptions used in the Monte
Carlo simulation model are as follows:
Risk-free interest rate
3.25 %
Expected stock price volatility
70 %
The Company estimated the volatility
of the ordinary shares of Plurinuva based on data from similar companies operating in the food tech field. The additional fair value determined
was $ 385 .
On November 22, 2022, the warrants in
Plurinuva expired unexercised and $ 1,014
were classified from NCI to additional paid-in capital.
NOTE 2: - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The accompanying interim unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments). For further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. The year-end balance sheet data was derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2022, but not all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP are included.
Operating results for the six-month
period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023.
b.
Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies followed
in the preparation of these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are identical to those applied in the preparation
of the latest annual financial statements.
c.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that are
reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

d.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term bank deposits and other current assets, trade
payable and other accounts payable, approximate their fair value because of their generally short-term maturities.
The Company measures its derivative
instruments at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
(“ASC 820”). Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined
based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions,
ASC 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability.
The fair value hierarchy also requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company
categorized each of its fair value measurements in one of these three levels of hierarchy.
The Company measures its liability pursuant
to the Finance Agreement with the EIB based on the aggregate outstanding amount of the combined principal and accrued interest. The Company
does not reflect its liability for future royalty payments pursuant to the Finance Agreement with the EIB since the royalty payments are
to be paid as a percentage of the Company’s future consolidated revenues, pro-rated to the amount disbursed, beginning in the fiscal
year 2024 and continuing up to and including its fiscal year 2030, which cannot be measured at this time.

New Accounting Pronouncements
i.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
ASU 2021-04-Issuer’s Accounting
for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”).
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU
2021-04 that provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of
a freestanding equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as
an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the
difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification
or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment
for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination
or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on
or after the effective date. The Company has adopted ASU 2021-04, which has had an impact on the modification of the warrants to the non-controlling
interest in Plurinuva (see also note 1c).
ASU No. 2021-10-”Government
Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance” (“ASU 2021-10”):
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU
2021-10 “Government Assistance (Topic 832)”, which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions
involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the
effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021.
The adoption of this standard does not
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted
ASU No. 2016-13-“Financial Instruments
- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”):
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments
- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 changes
the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities,
loans, and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that generally
will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance also requires increased disclosures. The amendments contained
in ASU 2016-13 were originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those
fiscal years for the Company. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which delayed the effective date of ASU 2016-13
for smaller reporting companies (as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules (“SRC”)) to fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods.
Early adoption is permitted.  The
Company meets the definition of an SRC and is adopting the deferral period for ASU 2016-13. The guidance requires a modified retrospective
transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect that the
adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 3: - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a.
As of December 31, 2022, an amount of $ 1,350
of cash and deposits was pledged by the Subsidiary for bank guarantees related to its facility operating lease agreement and to secure its credit line for hedging transactions.
b.
Under the Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development, 1984, (the “Research Law”), research and development programs that meet specified criteria and are approved by the IIA are eligible for grants of up to
50 % of the project’s expenditures, as determined by the research committee, in exchange for the payment of royalties from the sale of products developed under the program. Regulations under the Research Law generally provide for the payment of royalties to the IIA of
3 % on sales of products and services derived from a technology developed using these grants until
100 % of the dollar-linked grant is repaid. The Company’s obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on its actual sale of such products and services. In the absence of such sales, no payment is required. Outstanding balance of the grants will be subject to interest at a rate equal to the 12 month LIBOR applicable to dollar deposits that is published on the first business day of each calendar year. Following the full repayment of the grant, there is no further liability for royalties.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s
contingent liability in respect to royalties to the IIA amounted to $ 27,574 , not including LIBOR interest as described above.

2022, or the 2022 Annual Report, as well as Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider
the various disclosures we have made in that report.
As used in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” and “Pluri”
mean Pluri Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Pluri Biotech Ltd. and Pluristem GmbH, and our subsidiary Plurinuva Ltd., unless otherwise
indicated or as otherwise required by the context.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company
with an advanced cell-based technology platform. We have developed a unique three-dimensional, or 3D, technology platform for cell expansion
with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, cell manufacturing facility. We are utilizing our technology in
the field of regenerative medicine and food tech and plan to utilize it in other industries and verticals that have a need for our mass
scale and cost-effective cell expansion platform.
We use our advanced cell-based
technology platform in the field of regenerative medicine to develop placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment
of inflammatory, muscle injuries and hematologic conditions. Our placental expanded, or PLX, cells are adherent stromal cells that are
expanded using our 3D platform.  Our PLX cells can be administered to patients off-the-shelf, without blood or tissue matching or
additional manipulation prior to administration. PLX cells are believed to release a range of therapeutic proteins in response to the
patient’s condition.
Our operations are focused
on the research, development and manufacturing of cells and cell-based products, conducting clinical studies and the business development
of cell therapeutics and cell-based technologies, such as our collaboration with Tnuva Food Industries – Agricultural Cooperative
in Israel Ltd., through its fully owned subsidiary, Tnuva Food-Tech Incubator (2019), Limited Partnership, or Tnuva, to use our technology
to establish a cultivated food platform and the recent collaboration agreement we signed with a leading European manufacturer of active
pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, to use our expansion technology, which aims to revolutionize the production of biologics by enabling
a cost-effective, sustainable and cruelty-free ingredient.
We expect to demonstrate a
real-world impact and value from our cell-based technology platform, our current PLX pipeline and from other cell-based product candidates
that may be developed based on our platform. Our business model for commercialization and revenue generation includes, but is not limited
to, licensing deals, joint ventures, partnerships, joint development agreements and direct sale of our products.
In the pharmaceutical area,
we completed a Phase III multinational clinical study in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture and two Phase II clinical
studies in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS, associated with COVID-19 in the United States, Europe and Israel. In addition,
we completed a Phase I clinical study for incomplete recovery following bone marrow transplantation in the United States and Israel,
and our PLX cells are used in an investigator-led Phase I/II Chronic Graft versus Host Disease study in Israel. PLX R-18 product candidate
is also being tested as a potential treatment for Acute Radiation Syndrome under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration animal rule. We
believe that each of these indications is a severe unmet medical need.
20
Food Tech
On February 24, 2022, we announced
the closing of the joint venture pursuant to joint venture agreement, or the Joint Venture Agreement, with Tnuva through the Subsidiary.
Under the Joint Venture Agreement, we established a new company, Plurinuva, with the purpose of developing cultivated meat products of
all types and kinds.
Pursuant to the Joint Venture
Agreement, Tnuva entered into a share purchase agreement, or the SPA, with Plurinuva and the Subsidiary, pursuant to which Plurinuva
issued on the closing date of the SPA, or the Closing Date, 187,500 ordinary shares, representing 15.79% of its share capital, to Tnuva,
as well as a warrant to purchase additional shares of Plurinuva, in consideration of an aggregate of $7.5 million in cash.
The first warrant, or the
First Warrant, issued to Tnuva permits Tnuva to purchase up to 125,000 ordinary shares of Plurinuva at an exercise price of $40.00 per
share and has a term commencing on the Closing Date and ending at the earlier of (i) six months from the Closing Date, (ii) immediately
prior to and subject to the consummation of an initial public offering or acquisition of Plurinuva or (iii) the consummation of a financing
round with a non-affiliated investor. In addition, on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, and provided that the First Warrant
has not expired, Plurinuva shall issue to Tnuva a second warrant, or the Second Warrant, which will permit Tnuva to purchase up to a
number of ordinary shares of Plurinuva, or the then most senior securities issued by Plurinuva, in consideration for such amount equal
to 200% of the remaining balance of the aggregate purchase price of the First Warrant, provided that Tnuva exercises at least 62,500
ordinary shares at a price per share of $40.00, or $2,500,000 in the aggregate, of the First Warrant. The Second Warrant’s exercise
price per share equals $76.00. The Second Warrant has a term commencing on the six months anniversary of the Closing Date and ending
at the earlier of (i) six months from its issuance, (ii) immediately prior to and subject to the consummation of an initial public offering
or acquisition of Plurinuva or (iii) the consummation of a financing round with a non-affiliated investor. On August 23, 2022, the First
Warrant was extended for an additional 90-day period, so that the exercise period would end on November 22, 2022. On November 22, 2022,
the First Warrant expired unexercised.
In December 2022, we reported
that our joint venture successfully completed proof of concept in its development of cultivated meat based on our cell-based technology
platform.
Technology Collaboration the Biologics
Field
In September 2022, we entered
into a collaboration agreement with a leading European manufacturer of APIs for liver and gastroenterological diseases. As part of our
collaboration, our platform is being utilized to develop and manufacture a unique biologic API used in drugs that treat liver and gastroenterological
diseases. The current source of this API is derived from animals that are sacrificed during the extraction process. The joint goal of
the collaboration is to grow the specific cells needed for this API in our 3D cell expansion bioreactor systems that secrete the biological
molecule without harming animals.
We believe that proof of concept
with this agreement and APIs will open opportunities for us to serve additional API manufacturers in the rapidly growing biologics market.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – THREE AND SIX
MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021.
Revenues
Revenues for each of the six-month
and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 were $89,000 and $2,000, respectively, as compared to no revenues during the six-month
and three-month periods ended December 31, 2021. Revenues for the six-month and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 were mainly
related to our collaboration in the biologic field.
Research and Development Expenses, Net
Research and development,
or R&D, expense, net (costs less participation and grants by the Horizon 2020 program, the IIA and other parties) for the six-month
period ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 37% from $12,860,000 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 to $8,056,000. The
decrease is mainly attributed to: (1) a decrease in clinical studies subcontractor expenses following the completion of our critical
limb ischemia and ARDS associated with COVID-19 studies and the end of enrollment of our muscle regeneration following hip fracture study
in November 2021, (2) a decrease in materials purchases in accordance with our manufacturing needs and plan, (3) a decrease in salaries
and related expenses as part of our cost reduction, specifically a reduction of 29 R&D employees (108 on December 31, 2022, compared
to 137 on December 31, 2021), (4) a decrease in share-based compensation expenses and (5) higher participation by the European Union
with respect to the Horizon 2020 grants, which relate to our critical limb ischemia and muscle regeneration following hip fracture studies.
R&D expense, net (costs
less participation and grants by the Horizon 2020 program, the IIA and other parties) for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022
decreased by 42% from $6,507,000 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 to $3,785,000. The decrease is mainly attributed
to: (1) a decrease in clinical studies subcontractor expenses following the completion of our critical limb ischemia and ARDS associated
with COVID-19 studies and the end of enrollment of our muscle regeneration following hip fracture study in November 2021, (2) a decrease
in salaries and related expenses as part of our cost reduction, specifically a reduction of 29 R&D employees (108 on December 31,
2022, compared to 137 on December 31, 2021), (3) a decrease in share-based compensation expenses and (4) higher participation by the
European Union with respect to the Horizon 2020 grants which relates to muscle regeneration following hip fracture program that commenced
during the 2018 calendar year.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative
expenses for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 40% from $9,376,000 for the six-month period ended December 31,
2021 to $5,635,000. The decrease is mainly attributed to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses related to market based vesting
conditioned restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman which was recorded as an expense
of $7,283,000 between September 11, 2020 and October 30, 2021, employee terminations and RSU expenses amortization over time.
General and administrative
expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 32% from $4,288,000 for the three-month period ended December
31, 2021 to $2,896,000. The decrease is mainly attributed to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses related to market based
vesting conditioned restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman which was recorded as an
expense of $7,283,000 between September 11, 2020 and October 30, 2021, employee terminations and RSU expenses amortization over time.
Other Financial Income (Expenses), net
Other financial income (expenses)
decreased from $317,000 in financial income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 to $515,000 in financial expenses for the
six-month period ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly attributable to expenses relating to exchange rate differences related
to the EIB loan provided to us in June 2021 pursuant to the finance agreement executed with the EIB, or the EIB Finance Agreement, following
the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
Other financial income (expenses)
decreased from $80,000 in financial income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 to $1,363,000 in financial expenses for
the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly attributable to expenses from exchange rate differences, related
to the EIB loan provided to us in June 2021 pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement, following the strength of the Euro against the U.S.
dollar.
Interest Expenses
Interest expenses decreased
from $453,000 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 to interest expenses of $406,000 for the six-month period ended December
31, 2022. This decrease is attributable solely to exchange rate differences due to the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
Interest expenses decreased
from $225,000 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 to interest expenses of $212,000 for the three-month period ended December
31, 2022. This decrease is attributable solely to exchange rate differences due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
22
Net Loss
Net loss for six-month and
three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 was $14,523,000 and $8,254,000, respectively, as compared to net loss of $22,372,000 and
$10,940,000 for the six-month and three-month periods ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to a decrease in general and administrative
expenses and research and development expenses, as a result of our cost reduction plan and the implementation of our new business strategy,
alongside the completion or termination of several clinical studies (in critical limb ischemia, ARDS associated with COVID 19, incomplete
recovery following bone marrow transplantation and completion of enrollment of muscle regeneration following hip fracture). Net loss
per share attributed to shareholders for the six-month and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 was $0.44 and $0.24, respectively,
as compared to $0.70 and $0.34 for the six-month and three-month periods ended December 31, 2021. We had net loss attributed to our non-controlling
interest in Plurinuva for the six-month and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 of $285,000 and $137,000, respectively.
For the six-month and three-month
periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had weighted average common shares outstanding of 32,878,434, 33,194,622, and 32,068,271,
32,136,352, respectively, which were used in the computations of net loss per share for the six and three-month periods.
The increase in weighted average
common shares outstanding reflects the issuance of additional shares pursuant to a private placement offering we conducted in December
2022, or the December 2022 Private Placement, and the issuance of additional shares upon the vesting of RSUs issued to directors, employees
and consultants.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, our
total current assets were $50,140,000 and total current liabilities were $5,284,000. On December 31, 2022, we had a working capital surplus
of $44,856,000, total equity of $24,966,000, out of which $1,775,000 is attributed to the non-controlling interest in Plurinuva, and
an accumulated deficit of $385,501,000.
Our cash and cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2022 amounted to $8,818,000, compared to $18,715,000 as of December 31, 2021, and compared to $9,772,000 as of June
30, 2022. Cash balances changed in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the reasons presented below.
Net cash used for operating
activities was $13,889,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $18,652,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease is mainly attributed to a decrease in net loss following the completion of clinical trials and the implementation of our
cost reduction and efficiency plan that we initiated in order to align with the change in our business strategy. Cash used in operating
activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of payments of fees to our suppliers, subcontractors,
professional services providers and consultants, and payments of salaries to our employees, partially offset by grants from the IIA,
the EU’s Horizon 2020 program, Israel’s Ministry of Economy and other research grants.
Investing activities provided
cash of $7,062,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $7,075,000 for the six months ended December 31,
2021. The investing activities in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of the withdrawal of $7,203,000 of
short-term deposits. The investing activities in the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of the investment of
$5,539,000 in short-term deposits and proceeds of $12,658,000 from withdrawal of long-term deposits.
The cash provided in the six
months ended December 31, 2022 by financing activities was related to net proceeds of $5,693,000 related to issuances of common shares
and warrants, net of issuance cost that were paid in cash, in the December 2022 Private Placement. No cash was used or provided from
financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
23
Between December 13, 2022
and December 27, 2022, we entered into a series of securities purchase agreements with several purchasers for an aggregate of 8,155,900
common shares and warrants, or the Warrants, to purchase up to 8,155,900 common shares. On December 13, 2022, we executed securities purchase

our authorized shares. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreements executed with the purchasers, we agreed to hold a meeting of shareholders
within 200 days of the execution of the securities purchase agreements for the purpose of increasing our authorized shares.
On December 14, 2022, Yaky
Yanay, our Chief Executive Officer, agreed to forgo, starting January 1, 2023, $375,000 of his annual cash salary for the next twelve
months in return for equity grants, issuable under the our existing equity compensation plans. In that regard, we granted Mr. Yanay (i)
334,821 RSUs, vesting ratably each month, and (ii) options to purchase 334,821 common shares, vesting ratably each month, with a term
of 3 years, at an exercise price of $1.12 per share. In addition, the Board of Directors also agreed to grant Mr. Yanay options to purchase
1,500,000 common shares, with a term of 3 years, with the following terms: (i) options to purchase 500,000 common shares at an exercise

options were granted in January 2023 and will expire three years from the later of the vesting date or the date upon which the Company
increases its authorized share capital.
On July 16, 2020, we entered
into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM , or the ATM Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we were able
to issue and sell our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $75,000,000 from time to time through Jefferies. Upon
entering into the ATM Agreement, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July
23, 2020.
On September 21, 2022, as a
result of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, and in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we reduced the amount available
to be sold under the ATM Agreement to a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $11,800,000 of our common shares from time to time through
Jefferies.
During the six-month period
ended December 31, 2022, we did not sell of our any common shares under the ATM Agreement.
24
In April 2020, we and our
subsidiaries, Pluri Biotech Ltd. and Pluristem GmbH, executed the EIB Finance Agreement for non–dilutive funding of up to €50
million in the aggregate, payable in three tranches. The proceeds from the EIB Finance Agreement were intended to support our research
and development in the European Union to further advance our regenerative cell therapy platform, and to bring the products in our pipeline
to market. The term of the project was three years commencing on January 1, 2020.
During June 2021, we received
the first tranche in the amount of €20 million pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement. The amount received is due to be repaid on
June 1, 2026 and bears annual interest of 4% to be paid together with the principal of the loan. As of December 31, 2022, the interest
accrued was in the amount of €1,262,000. In addition to the interest payable, the EIB is also entitled to royalty payments, pro-rated
to the amount disbursed from the EIB loan, on the Company’s consolidated revenues beginning in the fiscal year 2024 up to and including
its fiscal year 2030, in an amount equal to up to 2.3% of the Company’s consolidated revenues below $350 million, 1.2% of the Company’s
consolidated revenues between $350 million and $500 million and 0.2% of the Company’s consolidated revenues exceeding $500 million.
As the project term ended on December 31, 2022, we do not expect to receive additional funds pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement.
According to the IIA grant
terms, we are required to pay royalties at a rate of 3% on sales of products and services derived from technology developed using this
and other IIA grants until 100% of the dollar-linked grants amount plus interest are repaid. In the absence of such sales, no payment
is required. Through December 31, 2022, total grants obtained from the IIA aggregated to approximately $27,743,000 and total royalties
paid and accrued amounted to $169,000.
In
June 2020, we announced that we were selected as a member of the CRISPR-IL consortium, a group funded by the IIA. CRISPR-IL brings together
the leading experts in life science and computer science from academia, medicine, and industry, to develop Artificial Intelligence, or
AI, based end-to-end genome-editing solutions. These next-generation, multi-species genome editing products for human, plant, and animal
DNA, have applications in the pharma, agriculture, and aquaculture industries. CRISPR-IL is funded by the IIA with a total budget of approximately
$10,000,000 of which, an amount of approximately $480,000 was a direct grant allocated to us, for the initial period of 18 months. During
October 2021, we received an approval for an additional grant of approximately $583,000 from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium
program, for an additional period of eighteen months. The CRISPR-IL consortium program does not include any obligation to pay royalties.
Through
December 31, 2022, we received total grants of approximately $757,000 in cash from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium program,
out of which an amount of $62,429 was received during the six-months ended December 31, 2022.
As
of December 31, 2022, we received total grants of approximately $6,614,000 in cash from the European Union research and development consortiums
pursuant to the Horizon 2020 program. During December 2022, we received an approval for an additional grant of approximately $735,000
to be used towards our PLX-PAD cell program in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture.
On
September 6, 2022, we announced that a €7.5 million non-dilutive grant from the European Union’s Horizon program was awarded
to PROTO (Advanced PeRsOnalized Therapies for Osteoarthritis), an international collaboration led by Charité Berlin Institute
of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies. The goal of the PROTO project is to utilize our PLX-PAD cells in a Phase I/IIa study for
the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. Final approval of the grant is subject to completion of the consortium agreement.
The funds from the grant are expected to be allocated between Pluri and other members of the consortium in accordance with budget and
work packages which will be determined by the consortium. An amount of approximately Euro 500,000 (approximately $533,745) is a direct
grant that will be allocated to us.
25
The
Phase I/II study will be carried out by Charité, together with us and other members of the international consortium under the
leadership of Professor Tobias Winkler, Principal Investigator, at the Berlin Institute of Health Center of Regenerative Therapies, Julius
Wolff Institute and Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery.
The currency of our financial
portfolio is mainly in U.S. dollars and we use options contracts and other financial instruments in order to hedge our exposures to currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. For more information, please see Item 7A. - “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk” in the 2022 Annual Report.
We have an effective Form
S-3 registration statement (File No. 333-239890), filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the SEC using a “shelf”
registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to time, sell our common shares, preferred shares and
warrants to purchase common shares, and units of two or more of such securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount
of $250,000,000. As of February 13, 2022, other than the $11,800,000 of common shares we are eligible to sell pursuant to the ATM Agreement,
and the $30,000,000 of common shares we sold in a registered direct offering in February 2021, no securities have been sold pursuant
to our effective Form S-3 registration statement.
Outlook
We have accumulated a deficit
of $385,501,000 since our inception in May 2001. We do not expect to generate any significant revenues from sales of products in the next
twelve months. We expect to generate revenues, from the sale of licenses to use our technology or products, but in the short and medium
terms will unlikely exceed our costs of operations.
We may be required to obtain
additional liquidity resources in order to support the commercialization of our products and technology and maintain our research and
development and clinical study activities.
We are continually looking
for sources of funding, including non-diluting sources such as collaboration with other companies via licensing agreements, the IIA grants,
the European Union grant and other research grants, and sales of our common shares.
We believe that we have sufficient
cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.
26
Item 4. Controls and
Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures -
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed for the purposes of ensuring
that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
As of the end of the period
covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Changes in Internal Control

of fiscal year 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item

135,000 common shares and warrants to purchase 135,000 common shares, with an exercise price of $1.12 per share and a term of three years.
The warrants will be exercisable upon the later of six months from their issuance date, or until we increase our authorized shares. In
addition, the purchaser agreed to execute a proxy permitting our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to vote the securities
purchased in favor of any shareholder vote relating to a future increase of our authorized shares. Pursuant to the securities purchase
agreement, we agreed to hold a meeting of shareholders within 200 days of the execution of the securities purchase agreement for the purpose
of increasing our authorized shares.
The
aforementioned securities issued are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities

from registration.
Item 5. Other Information.
On
February 13, 2023, we, through our subsidiary Pluri Biotech Ltd., entered into a consulting agreement, or the Consulting Agreement, with
Mr. Zami Aberman, pursuant to which Mr. Aberman shall serve as the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors. A copy of the
