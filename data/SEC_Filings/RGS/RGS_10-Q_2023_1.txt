Adjustments consist only of normal recurring items, except for any discussed in the notes below. The results of operations and cash flows for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations and cash flows for the full year. The accompanying interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 and other documents filed or furnished with the SEC during the current fiscal year. Inventories: The Company has inventory valuation reserves for excess and obsolete inventories or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical costs. The Company exited its distribution centers in fiscal year 2022 and now stores inventory at a third-party facility. To facilitate the exit of the distribution centers, the Company sold inventory at discounts.
The inventory valuation reserve as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 1.9
and $ 1.9
million, respectively. In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, an inventory reserve charge of $ 1.2
million was recorded in Inventory reserve on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, an inventory reserve charge of $ 1.2
and $ 1.5
million, respectively, was recorded in Company-owned salon expense on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had inventory related to discontinued operations of $ 1.3
and $ 1.8
million, respectively, net of a reserve of $ 1.3
and $ 1.1
million, respectively. The increase in the reserve during fiscal year 2023 reduced the gain from discontinued operations. See Note 3 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill: As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Franchise reporting unit had $ 173.3
and $ 174.4
million, respectively, of goodwill. The change in goodwill for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is due to foreign currency translation. The Company assesses goodwill impairment on an annual basis, during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. An interim impairment analysis was not required in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation: Depreciation expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes $ 0.2
and $ 0.3
million, respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes $ 0.4
and $ 0.6
million, respectively, of asset retirement obligations, which are cash expenses. Depreciation expense in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 includes a $ 2.6
million accelerated depreciation charge related to the consolidation of office space within the Company's corporate headquarters. 7 2.      REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue: Revenue recognized over time Royalty and advertising fund revenues represent sales-based royalties that are recognized in the period in which the sales occur. Generally, royalty and advertising fund revenues are billed and collected monthly in arrears. Advertising fund revenues and expenditures, which must be spent on marketing and related activities per the franchise agreements, are recorded on a gross basis within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The treatment increases both the gross amount of reported revenue and expense and generally has no impact on operating income and net income. Franchise fees are billed and received upon the signing of the franchise agreement. Recognition of these fees is deferred until the salon opens and is then recognized over the term of the franchise agreement, which is typically
10 years . Franchise rental income is a result of the Company signing leases on behalf of franchisees and entering into sublease arrangements with the franchisees. The Company recognizes franchise rental income and expense when it is due to the landlord. Revenue recognized at point of sale Company-owned salon revenues are recognized at the time when the services are provided or the guest receives and pays for the merchandise. Revenues from purchases made with gift cards are also recorded when the guest takes possession of the merchandise or services are provided. Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability (deferred revenue) upon sale and recognized as revenue upon redemption by the guest. Gift card breakage, the amount of gift cards which will not be redeemed, is recognized proportional to redemptions using estimates based on historical redemption patterns. Product sales to franchisees and other partners are recorded at the time product is delivered. Information about receivables, broker fees and deferred revenue subject to the current revenue recognition guidance is as follows: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Balance Sheet Classification (Dollars in thousands) Receivables from contracts with customers, net $ 9,419   $ 10,263   Receivables, net Broker fees 14,006   15,592   Other assets Deferred revenue:      Current Gift card liability $ 1,950   $ 2,037   Accrued expenses Deferred franchise fees open salons 5,533   5,770   Accrued expenses Total current deferred revenue $ 7,483   $ 7,807        Non-current Deferred franchise fees unopened salons $ 2,664   $ 3,211   Other non-current liabilities Deferred franchise fees open salons 23,963   26,827   Other non-current liabilities Total non-current deferred revenue $ 26,627   $ 30,038   8 Receivables relate primarily to payments due for royalties, advertising fees, rent, product sales and sales of salon services and product paid by credit card. The receivables balance is presented net of an allowance for expected losses (i.e., doubtful accounts), primarily related to receivables from franchisees.
The following table is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the period: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Balance at beginning of period $ 6,559   $ 7,774   Provision for doubtful accounts 369   ( 41 ) Provision for franchisee rent (1) ( 208 ) 811   Reclass of accrued rent (2) 73   396   Write-offs ( 1,129 ) ( 589 ) Balance at end of period $ 5,664   $ 8,351   _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) The provision for franchisee rent is recognized as rent in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. (2) The reclass of accrued rent represents franchisee rent obligations guaranteed by the Company that were unbilled and deemed unrecoverable as of June 30, 2021. The amounts billed in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and the related accrual were reclassified to allowance for doubtful accounts. Broker fees are the costs associated with using external brokers to identify new franchisees. These fees are paid upon the signing of the franchise agreement and recognized as general and administrative expense over the term of the franchise agreement.
The following table is a rollforward of the broker fee balance for the periods indicated: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Balance at beginning of period $ 15,592   $ 19,254   Additions —   25   Amortization ( 1,586 ) ( 1,625 ) Write-offs —   ( 366 ) Balance at end of period $ 14,006   $ 17,288   Deferred franchise fees related to open salons are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. Franchise fee revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.7
and $ 1.6
million, respectively, and for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3.2
and $ 3.2
million, respectively.
Estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to deferred franchise fees for open salons as of December 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands): Remainder of 2023 $ 2,766   2024 5,378   2025 4,986   2026 4,521   2027 4,058   Thereafter 7,787   Total $ 29,496   9 3.     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: On June 30, 2022, the Company sold its Opensalon ®

million remains under the prospectus supplement, which equates to
9.5
million shares based on the share price as of December 31, 2022. 11 5.       INCOME TAXES:   A summary of income tax benefit (expense) and corresponding effective tax rates is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Income tax benefit (expense) $ —   $ 164   $ ( 28 ) $ 213   Effective tax rate —   % 3.8   % ( 0.6 ) % 1.6   % The recorded tax provision and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were different than what would normally be expected, primarily due to the impact of the deferred tax valuation allowance. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA) was signed into law. The IRA contains a number of tax related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations, as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. The Company has evaluated the IRA and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. With limited exceptions, due to net operating loss carryforwards, our federal, state and foreign tax returns are open to examination for all years since 2014, 2012 and 2016, respectively. 6.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: The Company is a plaintiff or defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Like certain other franchisors, the Company has faced allegations of franchise regulation and agreement violations. Additionally, because the Company may be the tenant under a master lease for a location subleased to a franchisee, the Company has faced allegations of nonpayment of rent and associated charges. Further, similar to other large retail employers, the Company has faced, and may continue to face, allegations of purported class-wide consumer and wage and hour violations.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 0.4
and $ 0.9
million, respectively, of expense related to litigation, and $ 0.6
and $ 1.1
million was paid during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company's previous point-of-sale system supplier had challenged the development of certain parts of the Company's technology systems in litigation brought in the Northern District of California. The Company and the supplier entered into an agreement, effective June 25, 2021, that provided for the dismissal of the lawsuit and set forth a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the supplier will assist in the transfer of franchise salons from its point-of-sale system to the Company's salon management system, OSP. The Company and the supplier entered into an amendment to the Settlement Agreement, effective June 15, 2022, in which the Company agreed to pay $ 2.0  million to the supplier in installments commencing on June 15, 2022, and ending on December 10, 2022, in consideration of a release of claims arising out of or related to the Transition Services Agreement and for the supplier to continue to provide the services set forth in that agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has made all payments under the agreement. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Although the actions are being vigorously defended, the Company could incur judgments in the future or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period. 12 7.     CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH: The table below reconciles the cash and cash equivalents balances and restricted cash balances, recorded within other current assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to the amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,406   $ 17,041   Restricted cash, included in other current assets (1) 13,052   10,423   Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
$ 22,458   $ 27,464   _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Restricted cash within other current assets primarily relates to consolidated advertising cooperatives funds, which can only be used to settle obligations of the respective cooperatives, and contractual obligations to collateralize the Company's self-insurance programs. 13 8.     LEASES: At contract inception, the Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining whether it conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. If the contract provides the Company the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, the Company considers it to be, or contain, a lease. The Company leases its company-owned salons and some of its corporate facilities under operating leases. The original terms of the salon leases range from
one
to
20
years with many leases renewable for an additional
five
to
10-year
term at the option of the Company. In addition to the obligation to make fixed rental payments for the use of the salons, the Company also has variable lease payments that are based on sales levels. For most leases, the Company is required to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.
Total rent includes the following: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Office and warehouse rent
$ 834   $ 1,202   $ 1,706   $ 2,815   Lease termination expense (1) 848   238   1,306   1,578   Lease liability benefit (2) ( 615 ) ( 496 ) ( 1,217 ) ( 2,927 ) Franchise salon rent (3) 9   246   ( 44 ) 575   Company-owned salon rent 1,014   1,852   2,092   2,748   Total $ 2,090   $ 3,042   $ 3,843   $ 4,789   _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred costs of $ 0.8
and $ 1.3  million, respectively, to exit salons before the lease end date in order to relieve the Company of future lease obligations. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred costs of $ 0.2  million to exit salons before the lease end date to relieve the Company of future lease obligations. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $ 0.9  million to exit its distribution centers before the lease end dates and incurred costs of $ 0.7  million to exit salons before the lease end dates in order to relieve the Company of future lease obligations. (2) Upon termination of previously impaired leases, the Company derecognizes the corresponding ROU assets and lease liabilities, which results in a net gain. In addition, the Company recognizes a benefit from lease liabilities decreasing in excess of previously impaired ROU assets for ongoing leases that were previously impaired. (3) Franchise salon rent in fiscal year 2023 includes the benefit of incurring less cost to terminate a lease than estimated. The Company leases salon premises in which the majority of its franchisees operate and has entered into corresponding sublease arrangements with franchisees. All lease-related costs are passed through to the franchisees. The Company records the rental payments due from franchisees as franchise rental income and the corresponding amounts owed to landlords as franchise rent expense on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, franchise rental income and franchise rent expense were $ 28.9
and $ 33.8
million, respectively, and $ 59.2
and $ 67.5
million, respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These leases generally have lease terms of approximately
five years . The Company expects to renew the SmartStyle ®
master lease and some leases for locations subleased to our franchisees upon expiration of those leases. Other leases are expected to be renewed by the franchisee upon expiration. 14 All the Company's leases are operating leases. The lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, including
one
lease term option when the lease is expected to be renewed. The ROU asset is initially and subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, less any accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives received, if any. Expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the lease renewal option when the lease is expected to be renewed. Generally, the non-lease components, such as real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses, are separate from rent expense within the lease and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability because these charges are variable. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company's estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot generally be determined. The Company uses the portfolio approach in applying the discount rate based on the original lease term. The weighted average remaining lease term was
5.77
and
6.02
years and the weighted average discount rate was
4.34 % and
4.25 % for all salon operating leases as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. A lessee's ROU asset is subject to the same asset impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, applied to other elements of property, plant, and equipment. The Company has identified its asset groups at the individual salon level as this represents the lowest level that identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Poor salon performance in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 resulted in ASC 360-10-35-21 triggering events. As a result, management assessed underperforming salon asset groups, which included the related ROU assets, for impairment in accordance with ASC 360. The first step in the impairment test under ASC 360 is to determine whether the long-lived assets are recoverable, which is determined by comparing the net carrying value of the salon asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. Estimating cash flows for purposes of the recoverability test is subjective and requires significant judgment. Estimated future cash flows used for the purposes of the recoverability test were based upon historical cash flows for the salons, adjusted for expected changes in future market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors. The period of time used to determine the estimates of the future cash flows for the recoverability test was based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the group, which was the ROU asset in all cases. The second step of the long-lived asset impairment test requires that the fair value of the asset group be estimated when determining the amount of any impairment loss. For the salon asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company applied the fair value guidance within ASC 820-10 to determine the fair value of the asset group from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. To determine the fair value of the salon asset groups, the Company utilized market-participant assumptions rather than the Company's own assumptions about how it intends to use the asset group. The significant judgments and assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the salon asset groups include the market rent of comparable properties and a discount rate. In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not recognize long-lived asset impairment charges related to ROU assets in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $ 0.1
and $ 0.2  million, respectively, primarily related to ROU assets in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The impairment loss for each salon asset group that was recognized was allocated among the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using their relative carrying amounts. Additionally, the impairment losses did not reduce the carrying amount of an individual asset below its fair value, including the ROU assets included in the salon asset groups. Assessing the long-lived assets for impairment requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions it uses to calculate impairment losses for its long-lived asset, including its ROU assets. If actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, the Company may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material. 15 As of December 31, 2022, future operating lease commitments, including
one
renewal option for leases expected to be renewed, to be paid and received by the Company were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Leases for Franchise Salons Leases for Company-owned Salons Corporate Leases Total Operating Lease Payments Sublease Income to be Received from Franchisees Net Rent Commitments Remainder of 2023 $ 54,914   $ 1,292   $ 1,061   $ 57,267   $ ( 54,914 ) $ 2,353   2024 99,860   1,617   1,301   102,778   ( 99,860 ) 2,918   2025 83,570   536   1,334   85,440   ( 83,570 ) 1,870   2026 69,825   290   1,367   71,482   ( 69,825 ) 1,657   2027 59,363   63   1,401   60,827   ( 59,363 ) 1,464   Thereafter 122,479   36   4,417   126,932   ( 122,479 ) 4,453   Total future obligations $ 490,011   $ 3,834   $ 10,881   $ 504,726   $ ( 490,011 ) $ 14,715   Less amounts representing interest 56,953   121   1,500   58,574   Present value of lease liability $ 433,058   $ 3,713   $ 9,381   $ 446,152   Less short-term lease liability 90,342   2,246   1,352   93,940   Long-term lease liability $ 342,716   $ 1,467   $ 8,029   $ 352,212   16 9.      FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: The Company's debt consists of the following:   Maturity Date December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022   (Fiscal Year) (Interest rate %) (Dollars in thousands) Term loan 2026 8.21 % $ 173,816   $ —   Deferred financing fees ( 7,970 ) —   Term loan, net $ 165,846   $ —   Revolving credit facility 2026 8.21 % 9,000   179,994   Total long-term debt, net $ 174,846   $ 179,994   In August of 2022, the Company amended its credit agreement. The amendment, among other things, converted $ 180.0  million of the previous $ 295.0  million revolving credit facility to a new term loan, reduced commitments under the revolving credit facility to $ 55.0  million, and extended the term of the credit facility from March 26, 2023 to August 31, 2025, with no scheduled amortization prior to maturity. The amendment is accounted for as a modification of debt and any unamortized financing fees that existed at the date of the amendment and new financing fees incurred are amortized through the extended term of the credit facility. At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding standby letters of credit under the revolving credit facility of $ 11.8
million, primarily related to the Company's self-insurance program. As of December 31, 2022, total liquidity and available credit under the revolving credit facility, as defined by the agreement, were $ 43.7
and $ 34.3
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 9.4
million and current liabilities of $ 138.9
million. The agreement utilizes an interest rate margin that is subject to annual increases. The margin applicable to term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) loans is currently
3.875 %. Effective March 27, 2023, the margin will increase to
6.25 %, of which
4.25 % will be paid currently in cash and
2.00 % will be PIK interest (added to the principal balance and thereafter accruing interest). Effective March 27, 2024, the margin will increase to
7.25 %, of which
4.25 % will be paid currently in cash and
3.00 % will be PIK interest. The margin applicable to base rate loans will be 100 basis points ( 1.00 %) less than the margin applicable to term SOFR loans. The agreement contains typical provisions and financial covenants regarding minimum EBITDA, maximum leverage and minimum fixed-charge coverage and a minimum liquidity threshold of $ 10.0  million. The Company was in compliance with its covenants and other requirements of the financing arrangements as of December 31, 2022. 17 10.      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: Fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, inventory, deferred compensation assets, accounts payable and debt approximated their carrying values.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We measure certain assets, including the Company's equity method investments, tangible fixed and other assets and goodwill, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections. 11.      EARNINGS PER SHARE: The Company's basic earnings per share is calculated as net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested outstanding stock options (SOs), stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock-settled performance units (PSUs). The Company's diluted earnings per share is calculated as net loss divided by weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, which includes shares issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based awards with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the Company's common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The computation of weighted average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, excluded
4,143,828
and
2,960,122
of stock-based awards during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and excluded
3,662,602
and
2,635,055
of stock-based awards during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as they were not dilutive under the treasury stock method. 18 12.      SEGMENT INFORMATION: Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.
The Company's reportable operating segments consisted of the following salons: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 FRANCHISE SALONS: Supercuts 2,160   2,264   SmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart Stores 1,605   1,646   Portfolio Brands 1,293   1,344   Total North American salons 5,058   5,254   Total International salons (1) 138   141   Total Franchise salons 5,196   5,395   as a percent of total Franchise and Company-owned salons 98.6   % 98.1   % COMPANY-OWNED SALONS: Supercuts 10   18   SmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart Stores 48   49   Portfolio Brands 17   38   Total Company-owned salons 75   105   as a percent of total Franchise and Company-owned salons 1.4   % 1.9   % OWNERSHIP INTEREST LOCATIONS: Equity ownership interest locations 76   76   Grand Total, System-wide 5,347   5,576   _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Canadian and Puerto Rican salons are included in the North American salon totals. As of December 31, 2022, the Franchise operating segment is comprised primarily of Supercuts ® , SmartStyle ® , Cost Cutters ® , First Choice Haircutters ® , Magicuts ® , and Roosters ®
concepts and the Company-owned operating segment is comprised primarily of Supercuts ® , SmartStyle ® , and other regional trade names. 19 Financial information concerning the Company's reportable operating segments is shown in the tables below. Segment information is presented in the same way that the Company internally organizes the business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company revised its internal reporting such that the CODM’s primary measures of segment performance are revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA. Revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA are regularly reviewed by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments, assess current performance and forecast future performance. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. C onsistent with our internal management reporting, unallocated expenses include certain items
impacting comparability. These unallocated items are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. They are based on how management views the business, makes financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance and are not attributable to either segment. Unallocated fees include distribution center wind down fees, inventory reserve, one-time professional fees and settlements, severance expense, the benefit from lease liability decreases in excess of previously impaired ROUA, lease termination fees, asset retirement obligation costs and long-lived asset impairment charges. Figures for prior reporting periods have been restated to conform to the current period.   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021   (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Franchise $ 57,354   $ 64,227   $ 116,111   $ 133,040   Company-owned 2,613   5,043   5,727   13,048   Total revenue 59,967   69,270   121,838   146,088   Segment adjusted EBITDA: Franchise 7,532   5,721   12,523   2,256   Company-owned 303   ( 3,133 ) ( 863 ) ( 4,688 ) Total

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A included in our June 30, 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed or furnished with the SEC during the current fiscal year. MANAGEMENT'S OVERVIEW Regis Corporation (NYSE:RGS) is a leader in the beauty salon industry. As of December 31, 2022, the Company franchised, owned or held ownership interests in 5,347 worldwide locations. Our locations consisted of 5,271 system-wide North American and international salons, and 76 locations in which we maintained a non-controlling ownership interest less than 100 percent. Regis’ franchised and corporate locations operate under concepts such as Supercuts ® , SmartStyle ® , Cost Cutters ® , Roosters ®
and First Choice Haircutters ® . Regis maintains an ownership interest in Empire Education Group in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 545 employees worldwide. Merchandising Strategy As part of the Company's transformation to focus on managing and nurturing brands, and in line with its capital-light business, the Company shifted its product business from a wholesale model to a third-party distribution model in fiscal year 2022. Management expects the change will positively impact franchisees by providing them access to industry-leading pricing, loyalty programs, promotional benefits, educational assets, and ongoing support. The Company receives a rebate from the third-party distributor, which is included in fees on the interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of the change, product sales to franchisees will continue to decrease and are expected to provide less revenue and costs in fiscal year 2023 as compared to prior year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing the interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make various judgments, estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and (2) other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of the June 30, 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Notes 1 and 2 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe the accounting policies related to the valuation of goodwill and the valuation and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations. Discussion of each of these policies is contained under "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7 of our June 30, 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our policies related to revenue recognition guidance can be found in Note 2 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS System-wide results As an asset-light franchise platform, our results are impacted by our system-wide sales, which include sales by all points of distribution, whether owned by our franchisees or the Company. While we do not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that this operating measure is important in obtaining an understanding of our financial performance. We believe system-wide sales information aids in understanding how we derive royalty revenue and in evaluating performance. System-wide same-store sales by concept are detailed in the table below: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Supercuts 7.2  % 30.8  % 8.0  % 30.6  % SmartStyle (2.9) 13.2  (3.1) 15.1  Portfolio Brands 6.0  16.6  4.8  17.6  Consolidated system-wide same-store sales (1) 4.5  % 22.1  % 4.5  % 22.6  % _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) System-wide same-store sales are calculated as the total change in sales for system-wide franchise and company-owned locations that were open on a specific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior period. Quarterly and year-to-date system-wide same-store sales are the sum of the system-wide same-store sales computed on a daily basis. Franchise salons that do not report daily sales are excluded from same-store sales. System-wide same-store sales are calculated in local currencies to remove foreign currency fluctuations from the calculation. 22 Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations (Unaudited) The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information derived from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Consolidated revenues are comprised of royalties, fees, product sales to franchisees, advertising fund contributions, franchise rental income and company-owned salon revenue. Consolidated revenue decreased $9.3 and $24.3 million, or 13.4% and 16.6%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Royalty revenue increased $0.1 and $0.6 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, due to improved system-wide same-store sales and average royalty rates. The overall decrease in revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 is due to the decrease in company-owned salon revenue of $2.4 and $7.3 million, respectively, due primarily to salon closures, the decline in product sales to franchisees of $1.3 and $8.8 million, respectively, and the decline in franchise rental income of $4.9 and $8.3 million, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 17 salons were sold to franchisees and 452 and 20 system-wide salons were closed and constructed, respectively (2023 Net Salon Count Changes).
Royalties During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, royalties increased $0.1 and $0.6 million, or 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily due to higher average royalty rates and improved system-wide same-store sales partially offset by a decrease in franchise salon count. Fees During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, fees decreased $0.7 and $0.4 million, or 17.9% and 6.5%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in terminated development agreements in fiscal year 2023 partially offset by an increase in the rebate received from the Company's shift in its product business to a third-party distribution model. Product Sales to Franchisees Product sales to franchisees decreased $1.3 and $8.8 million, or 54.2% and 84.6%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the Company's shift in its product business to a third-party distribution model. Advertising Fund Contributions Advertising fund contributions did not change significantly year-over-year, declining slightly due to a reduction in salon count partially offset by an increase in system-wide same-store sales. Franchise Rental Income During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, franchise rental income decreased $4.9 and $8.3 million, or 14.5% and 12.3%, respectively, primarily due to a lower franchise salon count. Company-owned Salon Revenue During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, company-owned salon revenue decreased $2.4 and $7.3 million, or 48.0% and 56.2%, respectively, due to the decrease in company-owned salon count and a decline in product sales. Cost of Product Sales to Franchisees The 1,100 basis point decrease in cost of product as a percent of product revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher marketing and freight expense in fiscal year 2022. The 870 basis point increase in cost of product as a percent of product revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the Company reducing prices to liquidate distribution center inventory. Inventory Reserve In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an inventory reserve charge of $1.2 million related to slow moving products. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded inventory reserve charges of $1.2 and $1.5 million, respectively, which were included in company-owned salon expense related to distribution center inventory. 24 General and Administrative General and administrative expense decreased $3.4 and $9.8 million, or 22.5% and 27.3%, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Lower administrative and field management compensation resulting from headcount reductions, a decrease in expenses associated with the distribution center closures in fiscal year 2022 and a favorable actuarial adjustment of $0.6 million contributed to the decrease.
Rent Rent expense decreased $0.9 and $1.0 million, or 30.0% and 20.8%, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. There was a benefit of $0.1 and $1.2 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 related to Canadian COVID-19 rent relief, which was offset by the net reduction in the number of company-owned salons in fiscal year 2023.
Advertising Fund Expense Advertising fund expense did not change significantly year-over-year, declining slightly due to a reduction in salon count partially offset by an increase in system-wide same-store sales. Franchise Rent Expense During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, franchise rent expense decreased $4.9 and $8.3 million, or 14.5% and 12.3%, respectively, primarily due to a lower franchise salon count. Company-owned Salon Expense Company-owned salon expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $2.9 and $7.8 million, or 56.9% and 60.0%, respectively, primarily due to the reduction in company-owned salon count and a decline in product sales, partially offset by $0.8 and $1.4 million of Canadian wage relief received in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization The increases of $2.2 and $1.9 million, or 137.5% and 61.3%, in depreciation and amortization during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, were primarily due to a $2.6 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the consolidation of office space within the Company's corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower asset retirement obligations ("white boxing" salons at lease end) and the net reduction in company-owned salon count. Long-Lived Asset Impairment In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not record a long-lived asset impairment charge, and in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $0.1 and $0.2 million, respectively. The decreases in long-lived asset impairment was primarily due to salons being impaired in prior periods. Interest Expense The $1.2 and $1.9 million increases in interest expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, were primarily due to the amortization of fees related to the credit amendment that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and a higher interest rate on outstanding borrowings. Loss from Sale of Salon Assets to Franchisees, Net There was one salon sold in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 13 and 94 in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, which resulted in $0.6 and $1.7 million decreases in the loss from sale of salon assets to franchisees, net. 25 Other, Net
Other, net increased $1.1 and $0.9 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily due to a $1.1 million grant received from the state of North Carolina related to COVID-19 relief. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized no tax benefit or expense, as compared to recognizing a tax benefit of $0.2 million, with a corresponding effective tax rate of 3.8% during the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized tax expense of $0.03 million, with a corresponding effective tax rate of (0.6)%, as compared to recognizing a tax benefit of $0.2 million, with a corresponding effective tax rate of 1.6% during the six months ended December 31, 2021. See Note 5 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations of $0.1 and $3.4 million, respectively, and in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss of $0.8 and $1.9 million, respectively. The gain in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to receipt of $4.5 million in sales proceeds, of which $0.5 million were received in the second quarter, which were previously held back. See Note 3 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Results of Operations by Segment Based on our internal management structure, we report two segments: Franchise and Company-owned salons. See Note 12 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant results of continuing operations are discussed below with respect to each of these segments. Franchise Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (1) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) (1) (Dollars in millions) (Dollars in millions) Royalties $ 16.2  $ 16.1  $ 0.1  $ 33.3  $ 32.7  $ 0.6  Fees 3.2  3.9  (0.7) 5.8  6.2  (0.4) Product sales to franchisees 1.1  2.4  (1.3) 1.6  10.4  (8.8) Advertising fund contributions 8.0  8.0  —  16.2  16.1  0.1  Franchise rental income 28.9  33.8  (4.9) 59.2  67.5  (8.3) Total franchise revenue (1) $ 57.4  $ 64.2  $ (6.8) $ 116.1  $ 133.0  $ (16.9) Franchise same-store sales (2) 4.5  % 22.4  % 4.6  % 23.0  % Franchise adjusted EBITDA $ 7.5  $ 5.7  $ 1.8  $ 12.5  $ 2.3  $ 10.2  Total franchise salons 5,196 5,553 (357) _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not sum to total due to rounding. (2) Franchise same-store sales are calculated as the total change in sales for franchise locations that were open on a specific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior period. Quarterly and year-to-date franchise same-store sales are the sum of the franchise same-store sales computed on a daily basis. Franchise salons that do not report daily sales are excluded from same-store sales. Franchise same-store sales are calculated in local currencies to remove foreign currency fluctuations from the calculation. Franchise Revenue Franchise revenues decreased $6.8 and $16.9 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The decreases in franchise salon revenue during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to the decrease in product sales to franchisees due to the Company's shift to a third-party distributor and franchise rental income. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, franchisees purchased 17 salons from the Company and constructed (net of relocations) and closed 19 and 393 franchise salons, respectively.
Franchise Adjusted EBITDA During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, franchise adjusted EBITDA totaled $7.5 and $12.5 million, respectively, an improvement of $1.8 and $10.2 million compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The improvements are primarily due to an increase in average royalty revenues and a decrease in general and administrative expense. 27 Company-owned Salons Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Decrease) Increase (1) 2022 2021 (Decrease) Increase (1) (Dollars in millions) (Dollars in millions) Total revenue $ 2.6  $ 5.0  $ (2.4) $ 5.7  $ 13.0  $ (7.3) Company-owned salon adjusted EBITDA $ 0.3  $ (3.1) $ 3.4  $ (0.9) $ (4.7) $ 3.8  Total company-owned salons 75  150  (75) _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not sum to total due to rounding. Company-owned Salon Revenue Company-owned salon revenues decreased $2.4 and $7.3 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily due to the 2023 Net Salon Count Changes and a decline in product sales in salons. Company-owned Salon Adjusted EBITDA During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, company-owned salon adjusted EBITDA improved $3.4 and $3.8 million, respectively, primarily due to the closure of unprofitable salons and a $1.1 million grant received from the state of North Carolina related to COVID-19 relief in the three months ended December 31, 2022. 28 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In August 2022, the Company reached an agreement to amend its credit agreement and extend the maturity to August 2025 from March 2023. Under the amendment, the $295.0 million revolving credit facility was converted to a $180.0 million term loan and $55.0 million revolving credit facility with the minimum liquidity covenant reduced to $10.0 million from $75.0 million. The amended credit agreement includes typical provisions and financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA, leverage and fixed-charge coverage ratio covenants, the latter two of which are not tested until December 31, 2023. See Note 9 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and our borrowing agreements are our most significant sources of liquidity. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity, cash on hand and borrowing capacity, to meet its obligations in the next twelve months and beyond. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $9.4 million, with $8.4 and $1.0 million within the United States and Canada, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's borrowing arrangements include a $173.8 million term loan and a $55.0 million revolving credit facility that expires in August 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the unused available credit under the revolving credit facility was $34.3 million, the credit agreement has a minimum liquidity covenant of $10.0 million, and total liquidity per the agreement was $43.7 million. See Note 9 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, in February 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement and $50.0 million prospectus supplement with the SEC under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0 million worth of its Class A common stock in "at-the-market offerings." Net proceeds from sales of shares under the "at-the-market" program, if any, may be used to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, repay debt and support our brands and franchisees. The timing and amount of sales of shares, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including prevailing market conditions, the trading price of shares, and other factors as determined by the Company. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not issue shares under the prospectus supplement. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 9.3 million shares and received net proceeds of $37.2 million. As of December 31, 2022, $11.6 million remains outstanding under the share issuance program. Uses of Cash The Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. The Company's liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment needed to support its business strategies, the performance of the business, credit facilities and borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. The Company has a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities as discussed within Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Cash Requirements The Company's most significant contractual cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 were lease commitments and interest payments. See Note 8 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further lease commitment detail.
29 Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities During the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $6.9 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year. Cash used in operations improved due to lower general and administrative expense, a $1.1 million cash grant received from the state of North Carolina related to COVID-19 relief and less cash used for working capital. Cash use in fiscal year 2023 included a $2.5 million payment of previously deferred social security contributions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities During the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities of $3.6 million, primarily related to cash received of $4.5 million from the sale of OSP, net of a $0.5 million transaction fee. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities of $2.9 million was primarily due to capital expenditures, primarily related to internally-developed capitalized software. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million, primarily as a result of debt refinancing fees of $4.4 million, partially offset by a net $2.8 million borrowing under the Company's revolving credit facility. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $43.6 million, primarily as a result of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and a net draw on the Company's revolving credit facility. Financing Arrangements See Note 9 of the Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, for additional information regarding our financing arrangements. Debt to Capitalization Ratio Our debt to capitalization ratio, calculated as the principal amount of debt as a percentage of the principal amount of debt and shareholders' deficit at fiscal quarter end, was as follows: Debt to Capitalization (1) December 31, 2022 120.9  % June 30, 2022 120.8  % _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Excludes the long-term lease liability as that liability is offset by the ROU asset. The debt to capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2022 did not change significantly compared to June 30, 2022. 30 Share Issuance Program In February 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement and $50.0 million prospectus supplement with the SEC under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0 million worth of its Class A common stock in "at-the-market" offerings. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not issue shares under the prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2022, 9.3 million shares have been cumulatively issued for $38.4 million, and $11.6 million remains outstanding under the share issuance program. Share Repurchase Program In May 2000, the Board approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date. Since that time and through December 31, 2022, the Board has authorized $650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the Company's stock under this program. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The timing and amounts of any repurchases depend on many factors, including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of December 31, 2022, 30.0 million shares have been cumulatively repurchased for $595.4 million, and $54.6 million remains outstanding under the approved stock repurchase program. 31 SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as information included in, or incorporated by reference from, future filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and information contained in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of the Company contains or may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts.

There has been no material change to the factors discussed within Part II, Item 7A in the Company's June 30, 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 33 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.  Legal Proceedings The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Like certain other franchisors, the Company currently faces, and in the past has faced, allegations of franchise regulation violations, breach of franchise agreements, fraud and unfair or deceptive trade practices. These claims have increased following the Company's franchising of its company-owned locations. Additionally, the Company currently faces, and in the past has faced, allegations of non-payment of rent and associated charges pursuant to leases in which the Company is the tenant under a master lease for a location subleased to a franchisee. These claims have increased since the advent of COVID-19 and can be attributed in part to decreases in salon revenue causing franchisees to fail to pay rent or cease operations. The Company has incurred judgments and settled these lawsuits and claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Although the actions are being vigorously defended, in the future, the Company could incur judgments or settle claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period.   Item 1A.  Risk Factors
There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. 34 Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Share Issuance Program In February 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement and $50.0 million prospectus supplement with the SEC under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0 million worth of its Class A common stock in "at-the-market" offerings. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not issue shares under the prospectus supplement. On December 31, 2022, $11.6 million remains under the prospectus supplement, which equates to 9.5 million shares based on the share price as of December 31, 2022. Share Repurchase Program In May 2000, the Board approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date. Since that time and through December 31, 2022, the Board has authorized $650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the Company's stock under this program. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The Company last purchased shares in fiscal year 2020. As of December 31, 2022, a total accumulated 30.0 million shares have been repurchased for $595.4 million. At December 31, 2022, $54.6 million remains outstanding under the approved stock repurchase program.
