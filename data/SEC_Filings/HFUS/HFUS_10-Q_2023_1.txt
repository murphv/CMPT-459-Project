HARTFORD
GREAT HEALTH CORP.
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This
summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The financial
statements and notes are the responsibility of the Company’s management. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
financial statements. This disclosure should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended July 31,
2022, including footnotes, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Organization
Hartford
Great Health Corp. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its
name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018 and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our
business plans.
Through
its wholly owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd (“HZHF) and HZHF’s
60
percent owned
subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. (“HZLJ”), and through Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health
Management, Ltd. (“HFSH”) and its
90
percent owned subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Qiao
Garden Int’l Travel”), the Company engages in hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int’l Travel was disposed
on December 31, 2020.
The
Company started to engage in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd (“HF Int’l
Education”). On July 24, 2019 and March 23, 2020, HF Int’l Education established two
100 %
owned subsidiaries, Pudong Haojin
Childhood Education Ltd. (“PDHJ”) and Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.(“HDFD”), respectively, to
operate the early childhood education service under the brand name of “HaiDeFuDe” in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF
Int’l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education
Center (“Gelinke”). Gelinke temporally ceased its operations by the end of August 2021. On August 31, 2021, PDHJ established
one
96 %
owned subsidiary, Shanghai HDFD Zhongli Education Technology Co., Ltd. (“Zhongli”), two individual investors hold
the remaining
4 %
ownership.
Impacted
by the government regulation implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control the pandemic
in China since 2021, to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related party, Shanghai Oversea
Chinese Culture Media Ltd. (“SH Oversea”), to sell
90
percent ownership of HF Int’l Education and its subsidiaries
for $ 900
(RMB
5,850 ). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual, to sell
100
percent ownership
of HZHF and its subsidiaries for $ 1,000
(RMB
6,500 ). See Note 3 Acquisitions and Disposals.
Basis
of Presentation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hartford Great Health Corp, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries
in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests of the consolidated entities as a component of equity
separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries have been eliminated in the consolidation. The Company’s net income (loss) excludes income (loss) attributable to
the noncontrolling interests.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the identification and disclosure of impaired assets and contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain
amounts on the prior-year consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and cash flows were reclassified to conform
to current-year presentation, with no effect on ending stockholders’ equity.
8
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset
and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more
likely than not to be realized.
The
Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the
2017 Tax Act also creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”)) earned
by controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) must be included in the gross income of the CFCs’ U.S. shareholder income.
The tax law in PRC applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises.
The Company’s subsidiary does not receive any preferential
tax treatment from local government. The Company has been in loss position for years and zero amount of tax provisions, including GILTI.
Deferred tax assets as of the reporting periods ended were fully reserved for valuation allowance as they are more likely than not to
be realized.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606) on August 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective
method to all contracts that were not completed as of August 1, 2019. Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services
is transferred to our customers in an amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
We follow the five steps approach for revenue recognition under Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify
the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Billings to customers for which
services are not rendered are considered deferred revenue. ASC 606 has no material impacts on the Company’s financial positions.
The Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products or
providing services to a customer. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant
financing components or payment terms.
a.
Early
childhood education services: HF Int’l Education generates revenue from childhood education classes provided to its customers.
The educational services consist of parent-child and bilingual childcare classes. Each contract of educational classes is accounted
for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied proportionately over the service period. Tuition fee is generally collected
in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue and transferred to contract liabilities after trial period. Refunds are
provided to parents if they decide within the trial period that they no longer want to take the class. After the trial period, if
a parent withdraws from a class, usually only that unearned portion of the fee is available to be returned. Nil of revenue has been
generated during the three and six months ended January 31, 2023. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, $ 169,548
and
$ 324,912 , respectively, of revenue were derived from early childhood education classes provided.
b.
Hospitality
services: HZLJ generates revenue primarily from the room rentals, sale of food and beverage and other miscellaneous hospitality services.
The Company recognizes room rental and services daily as services are provided. Under ASC 606, the pattern and timing of recognition
of income from hotel facility is consistent with the prior accounting model.
Impacted
by the Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese regulation on education industry, both early childhood education services and hospitality services
have been sold on August 1 2022. Thus, there was no revenue recognized from the two-revenue-stream for the six-month ended January 31,
2023. See Note 3 Acquisitions and Disposals.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements .
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”. The standard, including subsequently
issued amendments (ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11), requires a financial asset measured at amortized
cost basis, such as accounts receivable and certain other financial assets, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected
based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to postpone the effective
date of ASU No. 2016-13 for public business entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on
its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE
2.
GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of obligations in the normal course of business. However, Hartford Great Health Corp. has incurred losses since inception, resulting
in an accumulated deficit of $ 6,945,669
as of January 31, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of Hartford
Great Health Corp. to continue as a going concern.
In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity
funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to Hartford Great Health Corp., and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management
believes that Hartford Great Health Corp.’s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However,
management cannot provide assurance that Hartford Great Health Corp. will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation.
The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of Hartford Great Health Corp. to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE
3.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
In
January 2019, HFSH entered agreements to acquire
100
percent equity interest of Shanghai Luo Sheng International Trade Ltd. (“SH
Luosheng”). On August 1, 2022, HFSH decided to withdraw from the agreement entered in January 2019 to acquire
100
percent equity
interest of Shanghai Luo Sheng International Trade Ltd. (“SH Luosheng”). There was no penalty levied or to be levied due
to delayed execution or inexecution.
Impacted
by the government regulation newly implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control
the pandemic in China since 2021, the Company’s business hasn’t been developed as planned and occurred significant loss from
the early child education practice. To avoid further operation losses, subsequently on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a
related party, Shanghai Oversea Chinese Culture Media Ltd. (“SH Oversea”), to sell
90
percent ownership of HF Int’l
Education and its subsidiaries for $ 900
(RMB
5,850 ). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual,
to sell
100
percent ownership of HZHF and its subsidiaries for $ 1,000
(RMB
6,500 ).

Overview
of the Business
Hartford
Great Health Corp. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008, under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its
name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018, and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement
our business plan as set forth below.
Ability
to continue as a “going concern ”.
The
independent registered public accounting firms’ reports on our financial statements as of July 31, 2022, includes a “going
concern” explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans in regard to the factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed in the financial statements, including
footnotes thereto.
Plan
of Operation
As
of January 31, 2023, the company has issued a total of 100,108,000 shares of common stock. On December 11, 2018, 96,090,000 shares of
common stock were issued at the price of $0.02 per share to raise an additional $1,921,800 in capital. On November 24, 2020, the Company

On
December 28, 2018, the Company acquired Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd (“HZHF”). On March 22, 2019,
the Company acquired 60 percent of Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. (“HZLJ”). On March 20, 2019, the Company
acquired Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. (“HFSH”) with 90 percent of Shanghai Qiao Garden International
Travel Agency (“Qiao Garden Int’l Travel”), which was disposed on December 31, 2020, and formed a joint venture entity,
Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd (“HF Int’l Education”).
The
subsidiary of HFUS in Shanghai (HFSH) advances operating funds from two related party entities, SH Qiao Hong and SH Oversea Chinese Culture
Media Ltd. The main purpose of the funding is to invest in Hartford International Education Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (HF Int’l
Education). Upon signing of supplemental agreement, HFUS currently holds 75.5% ownership of HF Int’l Education and maintains control
over HF Int’l Education. On July 24, 2019, HF Int’l Education established a 100% owned subsidiary, Pudong Haojin Childhood
Education Ltd. (“PDHJ”). On October 28, 2019, PDHJ had its childhood education center opened. On March 23, 2020, HF Int’l
Education established Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.(“HDFD”) and was approved the business license to conduct
childcare operations in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF Int’l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire
the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education Center (“Gelinke”). During the board meeting, SH Jingyu and another
noncontrolling shareholders also sold a total of 14.5% equity at zero value to HFSH. As a result, HFSH holds 90% of HF Int’l Education
and a total of 10% equity is held by two individual noncontrolling shareholders.
HF
Int’l Education has developed an enhanced model of childcare franchise management program and registered a new brand name, “HaiDeFuDe”.
HF Int’l Education has recruited a team of knowledgeable childcare teachers to develop series of independent textbooks designed
to targeted age of young children and register for the copyrights for these textbooks in September of 2020. Since then, HF Int’l
Education has begun marketing and promoting the enhanced model of franchise operation and management packaged program, under “HaiDeFuDe”
brand, to an initial of 50 franchisees throughout different regions of China. To achieve that, HF Int’l Education has incorporated
existing market resources throughout other major cities and provinces in China. The promotion of HF Int’l Education franchise operation
and management model was expected to attract other childcare education centers to join the “HaiDeFuDe” brand, and HF Int’l
Education expected to generate revenue from franchise and management fees.
Due
to market uncertainties during the pandemic, the board of HFSH adopted a new management approach to ease cash flow and reduce operation
loss. In March 2021, HF Int’l Education entered agreements with Hartford Health Management (Shanghai), Co. Ltd. (“HFHM”).
HFHM purchased seven education & intellectual property copy rights and ten “HaiDeFuDe” registered trademarks from HF
Int’l Education for a total amount of RMB1.2M and RMB1.0M, respectively. In June 2021, HF Int’l Education and its three subsidiaries
entered license agreements with HFHM for the rights to use the intellectual Properties (the “IPs”) HFHM owns. The IPs cover
in the license agreements are four sets of curriculum structure designed and fifteen trademarks including “HaiDeFuDe” registered
trademarks purchased from HF Int’l Education. As a return, on a monthly basis, HF Int’l Education and its subsidiaries pays
20% of its tuition revenue generated to HFHM as license usage fee.
Impacted
by Covid-19 pandemic and the government regulation implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government
to control the pandemic in China since 2021, to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related
party, Shanghai Oversea Chinese Culture Media Ltd. (“SH Oversea”), to sell 90 percent ownership of HF Int’l Education
and its subsidiaries for $900 (RMB 5,850). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual, to sell
100 percent ownership of HZHF and its subsidiaries for $1,000 (RMB 6,500).
The
company’s sole subsidiary, HFSH is currently working with herbal manufacturers to develop new herbal health supplement products
for wholesale distribution in China. The expected marketing and product launch date is in July of this year.

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms due to material
weaknesses in our internal controls described below.
