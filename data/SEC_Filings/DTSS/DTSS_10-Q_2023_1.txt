NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION
AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Datasea

October 27, 2016, Mr. Sun sold his remaining  1,666,667  shares of Common Stock of the Company to Ms. Liu. As a holding company
with no material operations, the Company conducts a majority of its business activities through organizations established in the People’s
Republic of China (“PRC), primarily by variable interest entity (the “VIE”). The Company does not have any equity ownership
of its VIE, instead it controls and receives economic benefits of the VIE’s business operations through certain contractual arrangements.
On October

the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with the shareholders (the “Shareholders”)
of Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited (“Shuhai Skill (HK)”), a limited liability company (“LLC”) incorporated

under the laws of the PRC (“Shuhai Beijing”), to become a VIE of the Company through a series of contractual agreements between
Shuhai Beijing and Tianjin Information. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, with Shuhai Skill (HK) and its subsidiaries

In December 7 2022, the joint prevention and control
mechanism of the State Council of China issued a notice, announcing ten targeted measures to further optimize epidemic prevention and
control (hereinafter referred to as the ” New Ten Rules”). This is a major adjustment made by the Chinese authorities to the
previous epidemic control policy. Later, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and other cities in China announced the follow-up implementation
of the “New Ten Rules”. The introduction of the New Ten Rules announced that China’s previous “dynamic zero” epidemic
prevention policy had officially come to an end. So far, except for some special medical key places, people do not need to provide nucleic
acid test negative reports when traveling. During the period when the new policy was introduced, the number of COVID-19 cases in China
has increased significantly, and people’s focus on COVID-19 has shifted from pre protection to better indoor living environment to avoid
repeated infection.

Facing challenges that are also opportunities, the needs for air sterilization
has likely become a permanent way of life for many and will likely continue into common. Datasea has developed five models Air Sterilizers
under its in-house advanced acoustic intelligence technology, to target public and private application scenarios such as hospitals, airport,
logistic warehouse, cold chain transportation and home care. In 3rd December 2022, the Company unveiled national Hailijia air sterilizer
product campaign with an online event and offline product showcases in various cities in China, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Tianjin,
Hangzhou and Harbin. More than 50 institutions specializing in trade and distribution from China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East
participated in the event, highlighting the market interest in the products. During the product campaign, Datasea has entered into eight
marketing and distribution agreements in order to expand the business and reach to customers and sell certain Hailijia air sterilizers
and purifiers in China. Moreover, Datasea Enters into an Approximately $ 20.5
Million Sales Agreement with an Online Distributor for the
Supply of Hailijia Air Purifiers.
We currently believe
that our financial situation will be benefited us through the new products and rising demands. However, in the event that the demands
continues on for a longer period of time, we may need to raise capital to accompany the business development in the future.
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GOING
CONCERN
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements (“CFS”) were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the six months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a net loss of approximately $ 2.63  million and $ 3.12  million. For the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a net loss of approximately $ 1.29  million and
$ 1.68  million. The Company had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $ 21.21  million as of December 31, 2022, and negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately
$ 1.77  million and $ 3.82  million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The historical
operating results including recurring losses from operations which raise doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. Although the range of such recurring operating losses has narrowed in recent years, there can be no assurance the
Company will become profitable or obtain necessary financing for its business or that it will be able to continue in business.
If deemed
necessary, management could seek to raise additional funds by way of admitting strategic investors or. private or public offerings, or
by seeking to obtain loans from banks or others, to support the Company’s research and development (“R&D”), procurement,
marketing and daily operation. While management of the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues
and its ability to raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. There is no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds
the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations. If the Company is unable
to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it may be forced to delay, reduce or cease its operations.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION
The CFS
were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC regarding CFS. The accompanying CFS include the financial statements of the Company and
its
100 % owned subsidiaries Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited (“Shuhai Skill (HK)”), and Shuhai Information Technology
Co., Ltd. (“Tianjin Information”), and its VIE, Shuhai Beijing, and Shuhai Beijing’s
100 % owned subsidiaries –
Heilongjiang Xunrui Technology Co. Ltd. (“Xunrui”), Guozhong Times (Beijing) Technology Ltd. (“Guozhong Times”),
Guohao Century (Beijing) Technology Ltd. (“Guohao Century”), Guozhong Haoze, and Shuhai Jingwei (Shenzhen) Information Technology
Co., Ltd. (“Jingwei”), and Guohao Century’s
99 % owned subsidiary – Hangzhou Zhangqi Business Management Partnership
(“Zhangqi”, a limited partnership) and
99.81 % owned subsidiary – Hangzhou Shuhai Zhangxun Information Technology Co.,
Ltd. (“Zhangxun”) which consisted of
81 % ownership from Guohao Century and
19 % ownership from Zhangqi, and Shuhai Beijing’s
99 % owned subsidiary - Nanjing Shuhai Equity Investment Fund Management Co. Ltd. (“Shuhai Nanjing”). During the year ended
June 30, 2022, the Company incorporated two new subsidiaries Shuhai (Shenzhen) Acoustic Effect Technology Co., Ltd (“Shuhai Acoustic”)
and Shenzhen Acoustic Effect Management Partnership (“Shenzhen Acoustic MP”). All significant inter-company transactions and
balances were eliminated in consolidation. The chart below depicts the corporate structure of the Company as of the date of this
report.
VARIABLE
INTEREST ENTITY
Pursuant
to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 810, “Consolidation”
(“ASC 810”), the Company is required to include in its CFS, the financial statements of Shuhai Beijing, its VIE. ASC 810 requires
a VIE to be consolidated if the Company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority
of the VIE’s residual returns. A VIE is an entity in which a company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys
the rewards of such entity, and therefore the Company is the primary beneficiary of such entity.
Under ASC
810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both
of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic
performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The reporting entity’s determination of whether it has this power is not affected by the existence of kick-out rights or participating
rights, unless a single enterprise, including its related parties and de - facto agents, have the unilateral ability to exercise those
rights. Shuhai Beijing’s actual stockholders do not hold any kick-out rights that affect the consolidation determination.
8
Through
the VIE agreements, Tianjin Information, an indirect subsidiary of Datasea is deemed the primary beneficiary of Shuhai Beijing and its
subsidiaries. Accordingly, the results of Shuhai Beijing and its subsidiaries were included in the accompanying CFS. Shuhai Beijing has
no assets that are collateral for or restricted solely to settle their obligations. The creditors of Shuhai Beijing do not have recourse
to the Company’s general credit.

Operation
and Intellectual Property Service Agreement  – The Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement allows Tianjin
Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd (“WFOE”) to manage and operate Shuhai Beijing and collect an operating fee
equal to Shuhai Beijing’s pre-tax income, per month. If Shuhai Beijing suffers a loss and as a result does not have pre-tax income,
such loss shall be carried forward to the following month to offset the operating fee to be paid to WFOE if there is pre-tax income of
Shuhai Beijing the following month. Furthermore, if Shuhai Beijing cannot pay off its debts, WFOE shall pay off the debt on Shuhai Beijing’s
behalf. If Shuhai Beijing’s net assets fall lower than its registered capital balance, WFOE shall provide capital for Shuhai Beijing
to make up for the deficit.
Under the
terms of the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement, Shuhai Beijing entrusts Tianjin Information to manage its operations,
manage and control its assets and financial matters, and provide intellectual property services, purchasing management services, marketing
management services and inventory management services to Shuhai Beijing. Shuhai Beijing and its stockholders shall not make any decisions
nor direct the activities of Shuhai Beijing without Tianjin Information’s consent.
Stockholders’
Voting Rights Entrustment Agreement  – Tianjin Information has entered into a stockholders’ voting rights entrustment
agreement (the “Entrustment Agreement”) under which Zhixin Liu and Fu Liu (collectively the “Shuhai Beijing Stockholders”)
have vested their voting power in Shuhai Beijing to Tianjin Information or its designee(s). The Entrustment Agreement does not have an
expiration date, but the parties can agree in writing to terminate the Entrustment Agreement. Zhixin Liu, is the Chairman of the Board,
President, CEO of DataSea and Corporate Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of the DataSea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu).
Equity
Option Agreement  – the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders and Tianjin Information entered into an equity option agreement (the
“Option Agreement”), pursuant to which the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have granted Tianjin Information or its designee(s)
the irrevocable right and option to acquire all or a portion of Shuhai Beijing Stockholders’ equity interests in Shuhai Beijing
for an option price of RMB 0.001  for each capital contribution of RMB 1.00 . Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Tianjin
Information and the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to certain restrictive covenants to safeguard the rights of Tianjin Information
under the Option Agreement. Tianjin Information agreed to pay RMB 1.00  annually to Shuhai Beijing Stockholders to maintain the option
rights. Tianjin Information may terminate the Option Agreement upon prior written notice. The Option Agreement is valid for a period of  10  years
from the effective date and renewable at Tianjin Information’s option.
Equity
Pledge Agreement  – Tianjin Information and the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders entered into an equity pledge agreement on October
27, 2015 (the “Equity Pledge Agreement”). The Equity Pledge Agreement serves to guarantee the performance by Shuhai Beijing
of its obligations under the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement and the Option Agreement. Pursuant to the Equity Pledge
Agreement, Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to pledge all of their equity interests in Shuhai Beijing to Tianjin Information. Tianjin
Information has the right to collect any and all dividends, bonuses and other forms of investment returns paid on the pledged equity interests
during the pledge period. Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to certain
restrictive covenants to safeguard the rights of Tianjin Information. Upon an event of default or certain other agreed events under the
Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Equity Pledge Agreement, Tianjin Information may exercise
the right to enforce the pledge.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation
of CFS in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant areas requiring the use of
management estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimated useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment, provision
for staff benefits, recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Although
these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the future, actual
results may ultimately differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the CFS.
10
CONTINGENCIES
Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the CFS are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that
are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates
the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of
the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s CFS.
If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated,
the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be
disclosed. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company has no such contingencies.
CASH
AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and
equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities
when purchased of three months or less.
ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE
The Company’s policy is
to maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable
and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had a $ 0
bad debt
allowance for accounts receivable.
INVENTORY
Inventory
is comprised principally of intelligent temperature measurement face recognition terminal and identity information recognition products,
and is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The value of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
The Company periodically estimates an inventory allowance for estimated unmarketable inventories when necessary. Inventory amounts are
reported net of such allowances. There were $ 54,900  and $ 56,971  allowances for slow-moving and obsolete inventory (mainly for
Smart-Student Identification cards) as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs and improvements that significantly extend original useful
lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line
method over estimated useful lives as follows:
Furniture and fixtures
3 - 5  years
Office equipment
3 - 5  years
Vehicles
5  years
Leasehold improvement
3  years
Leasehold
improvements are depreciated utilizing the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease term.
11
INTANGIBLE
ASSETS
Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Evaluation of the recoverability
of intangible assets is made to take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate
that impairment exists. All of the Company’s intangible assets are subject to amortization. No impairment of intangible assets has
been identified as of the balance sheet date.
Intangible
assets include licenses, certificates, patents and other technology and are amortized over their useful life of  three years .
FAIR
VALUE (“FV”) OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying
value of the Company’s short-term financial instruments, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable,
advance from customers, accrued expenses and other payables approximates their FV due to their short maturities. FASB ASC Topic 825, “Financial
Instruments,” requires disclosure of the FV of financial instruments held by the Company. The carrying amounts reported in the balance
sheets for current liabilities qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FV because of the short period
of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and the current market rate of interest.
FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES
FASB ASC
Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures that enhances
disclosure requirements for FV measures. The three levels are defined as follows:
●
Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include other than those in level 1 quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the FV measurement.
As of December
31,2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company did not identify any assets or liabilities required to be presented on the balance sheet at FV
on a recurring basis.
IMPAIRMENT
OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In accordance
with FASB ASC 360-10, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, long-lived assets such as property
and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable, or it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other changes.
The determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is made by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such
assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its FV. FV generally is determined using the asset’s expected future undiscounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or FV less cost to sell. For the six and three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no impairment loss recognized on long-lived assets.
UNEARNED
REVENUE
The Company
records payments received in advance from its customers or sales agents for the Company’s products as unearned revenue, mainly consisting
of deposits or prepayment for 5G products from the Company’s sales agencies. These orders normally are delivered based upon contract
terms and customer demand, and will recognize as revenue when the products are delivered to the end customers.
12
DEFERRED
REVENUE
Deferred
revenue consists primarily of local government’s financial support under “2020 Harbin Eyas Plan” to Xunrui for technology
innovation of developing the Intelligent Campus Security Management Platform.
LEASES
The Company
determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception under FASB ASC Topic 842. Right of Use Assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities
are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the
Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of its leases do not provide an implicit
rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value
of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit
rating would be. The ROU assets include adjustments for prepayments and accrued lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease
payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options.
ROU assets
are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the
impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets.
ROU assets
are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from
the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which
represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and
liabilities. The Company recognized no impairment of ROU assets as of December 31 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Operating
leases are included in operating lease ROU and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current), on the consolidated balance sheets. As
of December 31, 2022, the net ROU was $ 316,305  for the operating leases of the Company’s offices in various cities of China
and senior officers’ dormitory in Beijing. As of December 31, 2022, total operating lease liabilities were $ 339,571 , which was for
the operating leases of the Company’s offices in various cities of China and senior officers’ dormitory in Beijing.
REVENUE
RECOGNITION
The Company
follows Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).
The core
principle underlying FASB ASC 606 is that the Company will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company
to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based
on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are identified when possession of goods
and services is transferred to a customer.
FASB ASC
Topic 606 requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires the Company
(i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
each performance obligation.
The Company
derives its revenues from product sales and 5G messaging service contracts with its customers, with revenues recognized upon delivery
of services and products. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via product sale contracts and professional service contracts,
with performance obligations identified. The transaction price, such as product selling price, and the service price to the customer with
corresponding performance obligations are fixed upon acceptance of the agreement. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies each
performance obligation, the customer receives the products and passes the inspection and when professional service is rendered to the
customer, collectability of payment is probable. These revenues are recognized at a point in time after each performance obligations is
satisfied. Revenue is recognized net of returns and value-added tax charged to customers.
13
During
the six and three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s revenue of $ 1.45
million and $ 0.41  million  was
mainly from 5G messaging services includ ing 5G integrated message marketing cloud platform (“5G IMMCP”), 5G Short
Message Services (“SMS”) and 5G value-added service. In addition, during the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company’s revenue of $ 42,700
was from Smart Public Broadcasting project which was mainly for the auditory system design, music
database management and update, and intelligent broadcasting system customization; and $ 85,161
from sale of Hailijia series air purification
and sterilizers, which is the Company’s foundational acoustic intelligence product.
SEGMENT
INFORMATION
FASB ASC
Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The
management approach model is based on the method a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating
decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management
structure, or any other manners in which management disaggregates a company. Management determining the Company’s current operations
constitutes a single reportable segment in accordance with ASC 280. The Company’s only business and industry segment is high technology
and advanced information systems (“TAIS”). TAIS include smart city solutions that meet the security needs of residential
communities, schools and commercial enterprises, and 5G messaging services including 5G SMS, 5G MMCP and 5G multi-media video messaging.
All of the
Company’s customers are in the PRC and all revenues for the six and three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were generated
from the PRC. All identifiable assets of the Company are located in the PRC. Accordingly, no geographical segments are presented.
INCOME
TAXES
The Company
uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.”
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current period and (ii)
deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial
statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets also include the prior years’ net operating losses carried forward. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred
tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company
follows FASB ASC Topic 740, which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets
and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated
with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures.
14
Under the
provisions of FASB ASC Topic 740, when tax returns are filed, it is likely some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by
the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that
would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based
on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions
taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying
balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest
associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the statement of income.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and no charges during
the six and three months ended December 31, 2022, and accordingly, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits. There was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. The Company files a U.S. and PRC
income tax return. With few exceptions, the Company’s U.S. income tax returns filed for the years ending on June 30, 2018 and thereafter
are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities; the Company uses calendar year-end for its PRC income tax return filing,
PRC income tax returns filed for the years ending on December 31, 2017 and thereafter are subject to examination by the relevant taxing
authorities.
RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research
and development expenses are expensed in the period when incurred. These costs primarily consist of cost of materials used, salaries
paid for the Company’s development department, and fees paid to third parties.
NONCONTROLLING
INTERESTS
The Company
follows FASB ASC Topic 810,  “Consolidation,”  governing the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
interests (“NCIs”) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions
of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCI (previously referred to as minority interests) be treated as a separate component
of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent’s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated
as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially-owned consolidated
subsidiary be allocated to non-controlling interests even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance.
The net
income (loss) attributed to NCI was separately designated in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

CONCENTRATION
OF CREDIT RISK
The Company
maintains cash in accounts with state-owned banks within the PRC. Cash in state-owned banks less than RMB 500,000  ($ 76,000 ) is covered
by insurance. Should any institution holding the Company’s cash become insolvent, or if the Company is unable to withdraw funds
for any reason, the Company could lose the cash on deposit with that institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in these bank accounts. Cash denominated in RMB with a U.S. dollar equivalent
of $ 37,413  and $ 153,607  as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, was held in accounts at financial institutions
located in the PRC‚ which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies.
15
Cash held in accounts at U.S.
financial institutions is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other programs subject to certain limitations up to
$ 250,000  per depositor. Cash was
maintained at financial institutions in Hong Kong, and was insured by the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board up to a limit of HK $ 500,000  ($ 64,000 ).
As of December 31, 2022, the cash balance of $ 5,808  was maintained at financial institutions in Hong Kong. The Company, its subsidiaries
and VIE have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe the cash is exposed to any significant risk.
FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
The accounts
of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB and the accounts of the U.S. parent company are maintained in United States
dollar (“USD”). The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign
Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’
equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange
rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the
statements of operations.
The Company
follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and
all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional
paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.
The exchange
rates used to translate amounts in RMB to USD for the purposes of preparing the CFS were as follows:

BASIC
AND DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS)
Basic EPS
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS is computed similarly, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted EPS is
based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to have been exercised at the beginning of the period (or
at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during
the period. For the six and three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s basic and diluted loss per share are the
same as a result of the Company’s net loss.  1,319,953   warrants were anti-dilutive for each of the six and three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
STATEMENT
OF CASH FLOWS
In accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 230, “Statement of Cash Flows,” cash flows from the Company’s operations are calculated
based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts shown on the statement of cash flows may not necessarily agree with changes in the
corresponding asset and liability on the balance sheet.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected
credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured
at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2022. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its CFS.
In August
2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts
in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU
2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion
accounting models. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion
feature that is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components.
This modification will reduce the issue discount and result in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also
updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume share settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in
cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by ASU 2020-06 are freestanding
and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement assessment
by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract will be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether collateral
is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning
of such fiscal year. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective July 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the
Company’s CFS presentation or disclosures.
In May 2021,
the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation
— Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):
Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”).
ASU 2021-04 provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original
instrument for a new instrument.  An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the
fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then
apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category
(equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification).
ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the
effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt
ASU 2021-04 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
The adoption of ASU 2021-04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s CFS presentation or disclosures.
The Company’s
management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would
have a material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

NOTE
11 – INCOME TAXES
The Company
is subject to income taxes by entity on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which each entity is domiciled. The
Company’s PRC subsidiaries file their income tax returns online with PRC tax authorities. The Company conducts all of its businesses
through its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, principally in the PRC.
The Company’s
U.S. parent company is subject to U.S. income tax rate of  21 % and files U.S. federal income tax return.  As of December 31,
2022 and June 30, 2022, the U.S. entity had net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forwards for income tax purposes of $ 2.53  million
and $ 2.19  million. The NOL arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may reduce  80 % of a taxpayer’s taxable income, and
be carried forward indefinitely.  However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“the CARES Act”) passed
in March 2020, provides tax relief to both corporate and noncorporate taxpayers by adding a five-year carryback period and temporarily
repealing the 80% limitation for NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Management believes the realization of benefits from these
losses remains uncertain due to the parent Company’s limited operating history and continuing losses. Accordingly, a  100 % deferred
tax asset valuation allowance was provided.
The Company’s
offshore subsidiary, Shuhai Skill (HK), a HK holding company is subject to 16.5% corporate income tax in HK. Shuhai Beijing received a
tax holiday with a 15% corporate income tax rate since it qualified as a high-tech company. Tianjin Information, Xunrui, Guozhong Times,
Guozhong Haoze, Guohao Century, Jingwei, Shuhai Nanjing, Zhangxun are subject to the regular 25% PRC income tax rate.
As of December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022, the Company has approximately $ 15.29  million and $ 13.91  million of NOL from its HK holding company, PRC subsidiaries
and VIEs that expire in calendar years 2021 through 2025. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets depends upon the Company’s future generation of taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences
representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all the information available,
management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore
established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

The primary operational
goals are with the company’s core digital technology as the benchmark and include the following:
1. To provide best-in-class products and solutions in 5G messaging, acoustic intelligence, and smart city
technology.
2. Increase global sales of acoustic intelligent series hardware products represented by Hailijia Air Purifiers.
3. Maximize long-term sustainable growth of earnings and operating funds.
28
Business Strategy
The Company intends to accomplish these objectives by diversifying
its product portfolio, improving operating efficiency and accelerating market reach and client acquisition.
Datasea believes sustaining
growth and remaining competitive depends on leveraging technological innovation to provide customers with more quality and convenient
options. With a combination of comprehensive solutions for hardware and software products, Datasea not only can flexibly meet different
needs of customers but also serve customers on a large scale. The Company is committed to staying ahead of emerging market trends, creating
diverse revenue resources, and continuously improving its business model.
Meanwhile, Datasea is
aware of global environmental issues, and the physical and transitional risks a business will be exposed with the global transition to
more sustainable and socially responsible economy. To better assess and manage material ESG risks and impacts on stakeholders, as well
as identify opportunities to improve sustainability and stakeholder relations. Datasea decided to adopt an ESG analysis framework to understand
and mitigate ESG risks, identify opportunities, and make strategic decisions that support long-term success and resilience.
5G messaging :
Datasea’s VIE entity, Shuhai Beijing, has
subsidiaries, Guohao Century (Beijing) Technology Ltd. (“Guohao Century”) and Hangzhou Shuhai Zhangxun Information Technology
Co., Ltd. (“Zhangxun”), that increase and improve how people and businesses communicate, while delivering brands a platform
to engage, convert and efficiently nurture buying relationships by leveraging 5G messaging service.
The 5G messaging service is known as RCS (“Rich
Communication Suite”) and integrates phones, messages, and contacts. Specifically, this communication suite enables users to enjoy
various effective interfaces with integrated messages, including texts, pictures, audio, video and emojis, as well as status, location
and other communication capabilities. It has the characteristics of high touch rate, rich media, strong interactivity, convenient service,
and high security. By using 5G messaging, can serve the individuals, public and thousands of industries.
5G technology can create a new message ecosystem
in which customers and enterprises can directly and efficiently connect via short messages on mobile phone terminals. When businesses
apply 5G messaging to marketing initiatives, faster speeds, better transmission quality, and lower latency create new and improved customer
experience.
As a leading service provider in China’s
5G communication field, Datasea has three primary products targeting different customers and needs:
1.
5G Message-Marketing Cloud Platform (“5G
MMCP”) .
An all-in-one solution for all the communication
and marketing needs of merchants and customers from early communication, sales, and later maintenance. The goal is to use data to empower
marketing, drive user growth, lead enterprises to achieve digital innovation, and help enterprises create long-term value for customers .
2.
5G Integrated Messaging Marketing Cloud Platform
(“5G IMMCP”).
Expands the connection with existing clients through
SMS, email, push notifications, WeChat, Applets, and other third-party tools and user management functions. The platform’s converged
cloud products provide customers with a comprehensive one-stop service. Among them are AI voice, the ReadyTrust overseas communication
service, ReadyTrust+big data (Pink Plus), and other personalized functional services. These products provide more advantageous and valuable
support for customers and offer an avenue to add channels or purchase DICT value-added products and services according to the situation.
3.
“Smart Push.”
A new precision marketing solution that integrates
5G technology, big data, and data mining to transform marketing experiences. Because 5G wireless can accurately pinpoint locations, a
retailer, when using this integrated solution, can see who is near the store and immediately trigger SMS and video SMS to promote products
or services to the nearby customer.
29
Acoustic Intelligence :
Shuhai Beijing and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shuhai
Jingwei (Shenzhen) Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shuhai Jingwei”), and Shuhai (Shenzhen) acoustic Effect Technology Co.,
Ltd. (“Shuhai acoustic Effect”) further demonstrate a vision and ability to stay ahead of emerging trends with cutting-edge
acoustic intelligence solutions. Acoustic intelligence is a new field that integrates fundamental acoustic theory with artificial intelligence
to gather and process acoustic data and solve problems.
There can be numerous
real-world applications with acoustic-intelligence systems.   As it aims to introduce this transformative
technology and its applications to China and the world, Shuhai Beijing, together with Shuhai Jingwei and Shuhai acoustic Effect, combines
artificial intelligence technology and acoustic technology to offer dynamic instead of static products, such as its Ultrasonic Sound Air
Disinfection Equipment.
Datasea’s Ultrasonic Sound Sterilization
and Antivirus Equipment are some of the earliest products available worldwide to incorporate innovative ultrasonic disinfection with optics
against Covid-19. Leading labs like the Wuhan Institute of Virology have proven this ultrasonic disinfection technology to have 99.83%
efficacy in nine seconds against Covid-19 and 99.99% efficacy against Staphylococcus Albus and E-coli.
Effectively using the
mechanical effect, thermal effect, cavitation effect and other physical characteristics of ultrasound as well as the superposition of
chemical effects, under ultrasound excitation, will cause the coronavirus and microorganisms to vibrate. The amplitude of that vibration
will be substantial, producing strains that could break certain parts of the virus, damaging the outer shell and the RNA inside. Eventually,
the high-speed movement of the protons in the ultrasound will destroy the formation of microorganisms and effectively kill off harmful
bacteria and viruses.
Digital Smart City
Datasea’s digital smart city platform includes
a smart campus, smart community, smart scenic area, and smart security solutions. The smart city is based on the Internet of Things, big
data, and AI algorithm platforms and relies on the Datasea big data center, Internet of Things cloud platform, and artificial intelligence
cloud platform to create various applications for multiple industries. Through the application of various scenarios in the city and in-depth
integration of informatization, multiple factors can be realized and improved, such as:
1. Industrialization and urbanization
2. Refined and dynamic management
3. Effectiveness of urban management
4. Improved quality of life of citizens
Shuhai Beijing and its two subsidiaries, Guozhong
Haoze (Beijing) Technology Ltd. (“Guozhong Haoze”) and Heilongjiang Xunrui Technology Co., Ltd (“Xunrui Technology),”
are hereafter referred to as the “SCB Operating Entities” as they mainly and collectively focus on the Smart City Business.

have had a material impact on the Company’s quarterly earnings.
Although revenue managed
to increase year-over-year, Datasea saw a quarterly decline. Much of this is due to China’s “Zero-COVID” policies which caused
stringent lockdowns and supply chain bottlenecks. With much of the world interconnected through China-centric supply chains, Zero-COVID
measures caused a lag in production, and international roll-out plans, mainly because factories in China produce a more significant share
of the world’s manufacturing than the United States, Germany, and Japan combined. Under the late fall’s renewed lockdowns, China’s
ports saw slowdowns in delivering manufacturing orders, resulting in a lower amount of exports. Since the onset of the pandemic, these
have been some of the worst supply chain challenges.
30
Even though Datasea saw
and continues to see considerable demand, particularly for its air purifiers, the Zero-COVID measures led to a shutdown of many businesses
and factories across the country. These shutdowns, which increased in October and November, had a material impact on the Company’s operations
and growth initiatives.
Regardless, the Company
is cautiously optimistic about China’s “New Ten Rules,” which it implemented on December 7, 2022, effectively ending the “Zero-COVID”
measures. The abrupt end of “Zero-COVID” could mean a renewed focus from China on economic growth and promoting global business
activity. Despite the headwinds of the previous quarter, Datasea’s recent business developments indicate the Company’s resiliency
and progress in general business developments, contract acquisitions, product upgrades, marketing efforts, and industry recognition.

5G Messaging
1.A. Business developments:
Forecasts show that 5G mobile subscriptions worldwide
could increase from around 236 million in 2020 to almost two billion by 2024. Further projections show that China will have the fastest
growth and largest number of 5G connections over the next five years, with revenue expected to skyrocket from 0.6 trillion yuan to over
six trillion yuan in this decade.
China’s booming 5G market is disrupting everything
from autonomous vehicles to Internet-of-things (IoT) and cloud computing. Yet the wide acceptance of 5G applications across the country
may be transforming messaging and business communications the most, especially with the acceleration of digitalization and intelligent
construction in the Chinese business community. The growth of 5G in China has led to a rapid increase in the demand for smart-related
systems and promotional services. Much of that is because of China’s 48.42+ million enterprises; over 99% are SMEs (small and medium-sized
enterprises).
As a leading 5G RCS business solution provider
in China, Datasea had many exciting business developments in the quarter through its core 5G MMCP, 5G IMMCP, and smart push products.
In December 2022, Datasea’s converged cloud platform
product passed the relevant audits and officially came to market as the SaaS product of China Mobile Cloud Energy Center. Following this
approval, the product is formally a provider for China Mobile’s ecosystem. According to the enterprise search engine APP, this means Datasea
can meet the potential needs of more than 60000 business entities, more than 17 million group enterprise customers, and more than 957
million mobile customers.
With a unique SaaS and PaaS business model and
subscription service, Datasea provides personalized launch services for different industries, rapidly enhanced brand strength, and helps
enterprise customers achieve sustainable marketing growth. With customizable solutions and applications that can serve broad industries,
the Company intends to target more enterprise customers in various sectors such as finance, e-commerce, logistics, tourism, government
affairs, education, and power.

Specifically, these three major upgrades included
the following initiatives:
1. Integrate 5G IMMCP with the WeChat ecosystem (such as WeChat external chain, official account management,
applet management and other function development)
2. 5G IMMCP marketing tool development (including sharing fission, voting assistant, and lucky draw)
3. Content design of sop library
4. Public template library development and content design (including video message template library and letter
reading template library)
5. Data statistics optimization (WeChat external chain, official account management, applet management, and
detailed statistics of H5 page)
6. Development of log and personal sensitive information encryption function
7. Financial billing and adding balance functions (including 5G MMCP, 5G IMMCP, intelligent push to add balance
recharge, revenue and expenditure details, balance settlement, balance deduction, and other functions)
8. Migrating sending related functions of 5G MMCP to 5G IMMCP (text messaging, video messaging, AIM messaging,
5G messaging and other functional modules)
1.D. Industry recognition:
Datasea and its subsidiaries actively contributed
to creating 5G messaging frameworks and initiatives with some of China’s most important and influential institutions and enterprises during
the reporting period.
We are actively involved
in the discussion and creation of 5G messaging ecological regulations. Datasea participated in the compilation of the “5G Messaging
Development White Paper” jointly issued by the China Academy of Information and Communication Technology and the China Association
of Communications Enterprises in 2022. The white paper comprehensively analyzes the history and current situation of the development of
5G messages, systematically combs the development results of the industrial chain, and puts forward suggestions to promote the rapid development
of 5G messages based on the current development situation. The core points of the white paper include: 5G messages are an important part
of 5G public applications, which can help the high-quality development of information services, the current development of 5G messages
is in a critical window period of rapid development, and the development of 5G messages should fully rely on market mechanisms to promote
development.
32
Customers, Sales and Distribution
We sell our 5G messaging
products through our distributors and channel partners. $1,446,431, typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. A relatively
small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 100% and 100% of
our net revenue for this and last quarter, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels,
accounted for approximately 99% of our net revenue for this and last quarter.
2.
Acoustic Intelligence
2.A.
Business developments:
As the core platform
of Shuhai Beijing’s Acoustic intelligence business, Shuhai Jingwei and Shuhai acoustic Effec devote themselves to the technological
development and product design of smart products in significant fields such as healthcare, medicine, agriculture, supply chain management,
promotions, and sales.
During the reporting
period, it continued to develop its ultrasonic sterilization and antivirus products under the brand name Hailijia. Hailijia focuses specifically
on air purification and has five different models focused on in-vehicle sterilization and deodorization, restroom sterilization and deodorization,
and air disinfection and sterilization meant to respond to a wide range of market needs.
First, during October
2022, Datasea’s Shuhai Jingwei subsidiary entered into a $20.5 million sales agreement with Shanghai Chengming Shengyuan Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (“Chengming Shengyuan”) to provide Hailijia air purifiers. In return, Chengming Shengyuan will promote and distribute
the Hailijia air purifiers primarily through its e-commerce platform.
December 3, 2022 also
saw the Company kick off a national Hailijia marketing campaign with an online event and in-person product showcase events in some of
China’s largest cities, such as Beijing, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Harbin. With over 50 trade and distribution institutions from
China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East participating in the event, Datasea entered into eight marketing and distribution agreements.
On December 23, 2022,
as announced by the Heilongjiang Provincial Government Procurement Network, Shuhai Beijing won the equipment procurement project bid to
supply disinfection and sterilization equipment to Tieli Fangcang Hospital, the designated hospital in Yichun City. According to the purchase
contract signed on December 27, 2022, the Company will complete the supply of products within 30 days and obtain the full payment after
acceptance. This achievement is especially notable because procurement projects are characterized by “high requirements and strict
review”, which is a “touchstone” to test an enterprise’s comprehensive strength. The agreement also shows that key customers
recognize the technical capacity of the Company’s disinfection and sterilization equipment.
Simultaneously, Datasea
continues to strengthen the core team, so products can meet market demand and bolster supply chain capabilities to ensure support for
the rapid development of acoustic intelligent hardware products.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Shuhai’s
“Hailijia” ultrasonic air disinfection equipment can meet various disinfection needs and help protect families, staff, patients,
students, and visitors in private homes or public places. The Company believes that the innovative research and development behind the
Hailijia brand may one day replace conventional air purification equipment with a single purification function and significantly disrupt
a market worth roughly 10 billion yuan.
2.B.

Hailijia air purifiers are Datasea’s foundational
acoustic intelligence product and have the Company well-positioned for sustained success. Despite the headwinds of the previous quarter,
Datasea believes that acoustic intelligence-powered products will provide it with long-term revenue-generating opportunities and expand
its brand deeper into the market. Various businesses recently partnered with Datasea to integrate its acoustic intelligence products with
their own strategic initiatives.
During the reporting period, Datasea’s Shuhai
Jingwei subsidiary, in total, received more than a dozen sales contracts or purchase orders from a wide range of customers.
33

ESG Management
Datasea believes incorporating ESG considerations
into our operations and strategy will effectively help manage risks and identify opportunities that support our long-term success and
resilience. Furthermore, a strong ESG approach can foster positive relationships with stakeholders and enhance the company's reputation,
positioning us for competitive advantage in an industry undergoing rapid change. Therefore, Datasea decides to adopt a comprehensive ESG

preparation and analysis, and commenced ESG disclosure aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework. This
is an initial step in our evolution as we build a more unified sustainability framework.
Datasea opts for SASB framework to effectively
communicate ESG performance and risk management practices to our investors in a consistent and material manner. By doing so, we identify
specific sustainability metrics and disclosures that are tailored to our industry, and report ESG information that is most relevant and
important to our stakeholders. In addition, the information also assists the management team to make informed business decisions and assess
the company's overall sustainability and risk profile. There are several goals related to our ESG management in the long term:
● Improvement of the environment: commit to improvement of the environment. The company works actively to
safeguard the environment and conserving natural resources is manifested in its modus operandi and the products it delivers, and to satisfy
stakeholders’ sustainability concerns and requirements.
● Risk management: to help the company identify and manage sustainability-related risks, such as regulatory
changes, community opposition, and supply chain disruptions. By proactively addressing ESG risks, company can reduce exposure to potential
financial losses and reputational damage.

36
Datasea plans to distribute the first ESG report

our trust and credibility. This, in turn, provides our management team with a deeper understanding of the company's sustainability risks
and opportunities, and guidelines of the actions needed to maintain a responsible and sustainable business approach, mitigate risks, and
capitalize on opportunities. We believe a strong ESG program has the potential to elevate the company’s reputation, solidify brand
image, and grant us a competitive advantage over its peers in the long term.
Competition
The markets in which we participate are highly
competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing
in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries, as some of
our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect
this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing
competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively
depends on a number of factors, including quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system.
Going Concern
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a net loss of approximately $2.63
million and $3.12 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company had a net loss of approximately $1.29 million and $1.68 million.
The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $21.21 million as of December 31, 2022, and negative cash flow from operating
activities of approximately $1.77 million and $3.82 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The historical
operating results indicate the Company has recurring losses from operations which raise the question related to the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. although the range of such recurring operating losses has narrowed in recent years. There can be no assurance
the Company will become profitable or obtain necessary financing for its business or that it will be able to continue in business. The
unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
On July 20, 2021, the Company sold 2,436,904 shares of common stock at $3.48 per share. The net proceeds from the transactions were approximately
$7,640,000, after deducting offering costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $43,309.
If deemed necessary,
management could seek to raise additional funds by way of introducing strategic investors or.private or public offerings, or by obtaining
loans from banks or others, to support the Company’s research and development (“R&D”), procurement, marketing and
daily operation. However, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available,
will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We may be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means,
including debt or equity financings. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders.
Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for new investors. Further, we may incur
substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing
and distribution expenses and other costs. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets
and our history of losses, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise
from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent
that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to cease operations.

Revenues
We had revenues of $1,590,015
and $9,650,609 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which shows a $8,060,594 or 84% decrease by comparing
with the same period of 2021. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to during the global COVID-19 pandemic situation the reduced demand
for 5G SMS business in China, the decrease of the revenue from 5G messaging. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues
mainly consisted of service fees from our 5G SMS service platform.
From July 1, 2022 to
December 31, 2022, the Company generated $1,590,015 for revenue which consisted of 5G message business with an amount of $1,446,431, including
$390,373 from 5G SMS and $1,056,058 from 5G IMMCP; $42,700 from Smart Public broadcasting projects, $85,161 from Hailijia series air purification
and sterilizers, and $15,723 from others.
From
July 2021 to December 2021, the Company generated a revenue of $9,650,609, consisting of 5G business with an amount of $9,616,811, including
$7,786,104 from 5G SMS, $1,830,707 from 5G IMMCP mobile projects on the cloud as value-added service, and $33,798 from smart city projects.
During the six months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company significantly reduced 5G SMS business due to the low gross profit margin and focused on developing
the customers who have the ability to make prepayment for 5G SMS.
Cost of Revenues
We recorded $1,385,488
and $9,340,715 cost of revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which shows a $7,955,227 or 85% decrease
by comparing with the same period of 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cost of revenues was mainly the 5G SMS
service platform fees to suppliers. The decrease in cost of revenues was due mainly to the decrease sales of 5G SMS. The cost for 5G SMS
service, Smart Public Broadcasting and Hailijia series air purification and sterilizers was $1.31 million and $35,907 and $37,630, respectively,
for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
38
Operating costs incurred
from July 2021 to December 2021 were $9,340,715, and cost of 5G messaging service was $9,321,224 including $7,517,733 for 5G SMS, $1,803,490
for 5G IMMCP and mobile on cloud projects, and $19,491 for smart city projects.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 was $204,527 compared to $309,894 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, which shows a $105,367
or 34% decrease by comparing with the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to the decrease delivery
of services related to the 5G SMS service platform in 2022.
Gross margin is 12.9%
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross margin was
mainly due to our decrease of 5G SMS business that has lower profit margin during six months ended December 31, 2022. In China’s
mature and transparent market today, gross margins on services are far greater than those on hardware sales The improvement of gross profit
margin shows that the company’s measures to improve gross profit margin are gradually showing effect 1) costs will be reduced by
economic of scale over a larger number of customers basis and the increase of production 2) by adopting differentiation strategy, growing
brand recognition and customer loyalty will strengthen the Company’s pricing power; 3) after the commercialization of 5G messaging
in the Chinese market (expected in the fourth quarter of 2022), the target customers and product forms will be expanded. For example,
the Company will provide the 5G IMMCP as SaaS software, customization and value-added services to improve profit margin. The company will
continue to increase the share of high gross profit products in the sales while expanding the revenue, so as to further improve the gross
profit rate on the basis of the existing, and give investors a better return on investment.
Selling, General and
Administrative, and Research and Development Expenses
Selling expenses were
$422,779 and $386,991 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of $35,788 or 9%. The
increase was mainly due to the increase in payroll expense of salespersons by $33,350 and increased meal and entertainment fee by $2,600.
Currently, we are focusing
on developing products and software to assist digital city in addressing safety issues and public health issues, expanding the Company’s
leading acoustic intelligent application technologies and products, and continuing to develop 5G-related applications. We incurred R&D

With the wide acceptance
of 5G applications across the country, especially the acceleration of digitalization and intelligent construction in the Chinese business
community has led to a rapid increase in the demand for smart-related systems and promotion services based on 5G technology in the Chinese
market. This is because there are more than 48.42 million enterprises and business of all types and over 99% are SMEs.
As the global COVID-19
pandemic continues, Shuhai’s “Hailijia” ultrasonic air disinfection equipment is able to meet various disinfection needs
and help protect families, staff, patients, students and visitors in private homes or public places. It is expected to usher in a wider
market breakout period and the rapid growth of revenue.

with the same period of 2021. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to during the global COVID-19 pandemic situation the reduced demand
for 5G SMS business in China, decrease of the 5G SMS business which has low gross profit margin, and the Company’s focus on developing
the customers who have the ability to make prepayment for 5G SMS.

and $8,733,180 cost of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which shows a $8,361,800 or 96% decrease
by comparing with the same period of 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cost of revenues was mainly the 5G SMS
service platform fees to suppliers. The decrease in cost of revenues was due mainly to the decrease of sales of 5G SMS service in 2022.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 was $54,330 compared to $246,299 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, which shows a $191,969
or 78% decrease by comparing with the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to the decreased delivery
of services related to the 5G SMS service platform in 2022.
Gross margin is 12.8%
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross margin
was mainly due to decreased low profit margin business of 5G SMS. In China’s mature and transparent market today, gross margins
on services are far greater than those on hardware sales The improvement of gross profit margin shows that the company’s measures
to improve gross profit margin are gradually showing effect 1) costs will be reduced by economic of scale over a larger number of customers
basis and the increase of production 2) by adopting differentiation strategy, growing brand recognition and customer loyalty will strengthen
the Company’s pricing power; 3) after the commercialization of 5G messaging in the Chinese market (expected in the fourth quarter
of 2023), the target customers and product forms will be expanded. For example, the Company will provide the 5G IMMCP as SaaS software,
customization and value-added services to improve profit margin. The company will continue to increase the share of high gross profit
products in the sales while as the COVID-19 epidemic gradually eases expanding the revenue, so as to further improve the gross profit
rate on the basis of the existing, and give investors a better return on investment.

$129,715 and $156,192 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an decrease of $26,477 or 17%.
The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in payroll expense of salespersons by $30,050, which was partly offset by decreased meal and
entertainment fee by $3,700.
Currently, we are focusing
on developing products and software to assist digital city in addressing safety issues and public health issues, expanding the Company’s
leading acoustic intelligent application technologies and products, and continuing to develop 5G-related applications. The
investment in R&D is gradually regional precise. We incurred R&D expenses of $149,058 and $432,355 during the three months ended

the collection control, and promoted the fund collection of contracted delivery projects, which led to the benign return of funds and
had a far-reaching impact on the future.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Historically, we have
funded our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock and shareholder loans. To enhance our ability to continue to operate
as a going concern, we are dedicating resources to generate recurring revenues and sustainable operating cash flows. Given the development
of 5G technology, digital and intelligent development is the new normal to real economies and people’s daily life in China,
we believe there is great demand for our 5G and acoustic intelligent technology and products.
We expect to generate
revenues through expanding our current smart city, 5G messaging and acoustic intelligence business, and through continuous product innovation
and development as well as various types of value-added services. In order to maintain working capital sufficient to support our operations
and finance the future growth of our business, we expect to fund any cash flow shortfall through financial support from our majority stockholders
(who are also our board members or officers) and public or private issuance of securities. However, such additional cash resources may
not be available to us on desirable terms, or at all, if and when needed by us.
As of December 31, 2022,
we had working capital deficit of $2,796,249 or a current ratio of 0.32:1. Our current assets were $1,325,151. As of June 30, 2022, we
had a working capital deficit of $867,774 or a current ratio of 0.59:1. Our current assets were $1,256,801.
We expect the Company
to continue to support its ongoing operations and financing through revenue growth and increased financing activities. However, there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional working capital on commercially viable terms or at all.
The following is a summary

characteristics of rich media, high accessibility and lightweight. For individual users, 5G messaging provides point-to-point messaging
and group chat services, and supports text, pictures, audio and video and other forms. Users can send and receive 5G messaging without
downloading APP and adding friends; For industry users, 5G messaging can realize "message as a service", and support users to
directly pay and recharge, order tickets, query logistics, and place delivery orders in the message window. With rich multimedia message
delivery capabilities and high-speed service promotion capabilities, 5G messaging provide huge exploration space for the industry. Especially
for many "waist enterprises" and small and medium-sized enterprises, 5G messaging provide a fair and fast user access channel,
opening up unlimited space and possibilities.
44
In view of the significance of 5G news, the company
participated in the preparation of the 5G Communication Development Report (i. e., the White Paper of 5G news Development) jointly issued
by China Academy of Information and Communication Technology and China Communication Enterprise Association in 2022, which laid the foundation
for the future development of the 5G communication industry.
2. 5G messaging enterprise application has a huge market volume,
and is expected to create a new message distribution mode _ The 5G media news story has emerged.5G messaging will further realize
the service distribution of micro-scenarios,The 5G news will also be a new driving force for the digital economy which is a great
opportunity for the company's future development.
3. 5G messaging is a new opportunity for global
competition.
At present, the development of 5G business is
being promoted all over the world and has risen to the height of national development strategy. As one of the fastest and most popular
applications of 5G, 5G messaging will participate in global cooperation and competition.
Faced with the huge market scale of 5G messaging
enterprise applications, several seas are positioned as the leader of the cloud communication industry, the linker of industrial ecology,
and the innovator of traffic management. They will fully invest in and continue to innovate, integrate more closely with upstream and
downstream enterprises in the industry, and create greater commercial value.

standing in the bank and can get strong support from the bank in time. In 2023, the company will combine its own development situation
and development strategy, and make reasonable use of various ways to raise funds for the company's development.
Risks faced by the company and countermeasures
Innovation investment risk of 5G news and smart
city products _ Although the company has independent research and development and technological innovation strength, the 5G messaging
business of Shuhai is still in the early stage of growth. If the company cannot accurately judge the market development trend, or cannot
continue to update the 5G body messaging products with market competitiveness, the company's competitive advantage will be weakened, and
the company's profitability growth will be lower than expected. In this regard, the company has established a technical innovation system
with the RESEARCH and development institute as the main carrier, adjusted the business direction, strengthened the construction of the
existing team, introduced high-end talents, and improved the management level of the R & D innovation system. At the same time, an
active and effective research and development incentive mechanism should be implemented to improve the work enthusiasm, initiative and
creativity of r & d technical personnel, so as to improve the efficiency of product research and development and improve the quality
and reliability of products.
Risks faced by the company and countermeasures
The risk of new product market development The
company is optimistic about the acoustic product business for the long time, and the establishment of service business is one of the important
strategic deployments of the company. In order to quickly seize the market, for 5G acoustic new business companies need to invest more
capital, technology, human resources and other resources to rapidly expand the market share. If the company's marketing strategy and expansion
plan cannot well adapt to and guide customer needs, the market development may not meet the expectations. Risks faced by the company and
countermeasures.
