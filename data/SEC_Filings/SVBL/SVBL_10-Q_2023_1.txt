NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (the “Company”)
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral
properties. The Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 1996, the Company’s name
was changed to Metalline Mining Company. On April 21, 2011, the Company’s name was changed to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. The Company’s
fiscal year-end is October 31. The Company has not realized any revenues from its planned operations and is considered an exploration
stage company. The Company has not established any reserves with respect to its exploration projects and may never enter into the development
stage with respect to any of its projects.
The Company has been engaged in the business
of mineral exploration. The Company currently owns a number of property concessions located in Coahuila, Mexico (collectively known as
the “Sierra Mojada Property”). The Company conducts its operations in Mexico through its wholly-owned subsidiary corporations,
Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. (“Minera Metalin”) and Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V. (“Minas”).
On April 16, 2010, Metalline Mining Delaware,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in the State of Delaware, was merged with and into Dome Ventures Corporation
(“Dome”), a Delaware corporation. As a result, Dome became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Dome has a wholly-owned
subsidiary Dome Asia Inc., which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.
The Company’s efforts and expenditures have
been concentrated on the exploration of properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, Mexico (the “Sierra
Mojada Project”). The Company has not determined whether its exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable.
The ultimate realization of the Company’s investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the success of future property
sales, the existence of economically recoverable reserves, and the ability of the Company to obtain financing or make other arrangements
for exploration, development, and future profitable production activities. The ultimate realization of the Company’s investment
in exploration properties cannot be determined at this time.
Illegal
Blockade of Sierra Mojada Property
The Company’s efforts and expenditures
have been concentrated on the exploration of properties, principally with respect to the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, Mexico.
On June 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries
Minera Metalin and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. entered into an earn-in option agreement (the “South32 Option Agreement”)
with South32 International Investment Holdings Pty Ltd (“South32”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of South32 Limited (ASX/JSE/LSE:
S32), whereby South32 was able to obtain an option to purchase
70 % of the shares of Minera Metalin (the “South32 Option”).
On October 11, 2019, the Company and
its subsidiary Minera Metalin issued a notice of force majeure to South32 pursuant to the South32 Option Agreement. Due to an illegal
blockade by a cooperative of local miners called Sociedad Cooperativa de Exploración Minera Mineros Norteños, S.C.L. (“Mineros
Norteños”), the Company halted all work on the Sierra Mojada Property. The notice of force majeure was issued because the
Company and its subsidiary Minera Metalin was unable to perform their obligations under the South32 Option Agreement due to the blockade.
Pursuant to the South32 Option Agreement, any time period provided for in the South32 Option Agreement was to be generally extended by
a period equal to the period of delay caused by the event of force majeure.
On August 31, 2022, due to the ongoing blockade
of the site, the South32 Option Agreement was mutually terminated by South32 and the Company.
On March 2, 2023, the Company filed a Notice
of Intent with Mexico’s Directorate General of Foreign Investment to initiate a legacy NAFTA claim under Annex 14-C of the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to recover economic damages resulting from the illegal blockade of the Sierra Mojada Property by Mineros
Norteños (“NAFTA Notice of Intent”). The Company has been unable to access the project since the illegal blockade commenced
in September 2019. Despite numerous demands and requests for action by the Company, Mexican governmental agencies have allowed this unlawful
behaviour to continue and, as such, failed to protect the Company’s investment.
Arras Minerals
Corp. Spin-Off
On August 12, 2020, the Company entered
into an option agreement (the “Beskauga Option Agreement”) with Copperbelt AG, a corporation existing under the laws of Switzerland
(“Copperbelt Parent”), and Dostyk LLP, an entity existing under the laws of Kazakhstan and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Copperbelt
(the “Copperbelt Sub,” and together with Copperbelt Parent, “Copperbelt”), pursuant to which the Company has the
exclusive right and option to acquire Copperbelt’s right, title and
100 % interest in the Beskauga property located in Kazakhstan
(the “Beskauga Property”), which consists of the Beskauga Main project (the “Beskauga Main Project”) and the Beskauga
South project (the “Beskauga South Project,” and together the Beskauga Main Project, the “Beskauga Project”).
The transaction contemplated by the Beskauga Option Agreement closed on January 26, 2021.
On
February 5, 2021, Arras Minerals Corp. (“Arras”) was incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. On March 19, 2021, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Arras, the Company transferred its right, title and interest
in and to the Beskauga Option Agreement, among other things, to Arras in exchange for
36,000,000
common shares of Arras. On September 24, 2021, the Company distributed to its shareholders one Arras common share for each Silver Bull
share held by such shareholders, or
34,547,838
Arras shares in total. Upon completion of the distribution, the Company retained
1,452,162
Arras common shares as a strategic investment and Arras became a stand-alone company.
Exploration Stage
The
Company has established the existence of mineral resources for the Sierra Mojada Project. The Company has not established proven or probable
reserves, as defined by the United States Securities and
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
subpart
1300 of Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”), through the completion of a “final” or “bankable” feasibility
study for Sierra Mojada Project. Furthermore, the Company has no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for Sierra Mojada Project.
As a result, and despite the fact that the Company commenced extraction of mineral resources at the Sierra Mojada Property, the Company
remains an exploration stage company, as defined by the SEC.
Beginning with the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
October 31, 2022, the Company reports its mineral resources in accordance with S-K 1300.
8
Going Concern
Since its inception in November 1993, the Company
has not generated revenue and has incurred an accumulated deficit of $ 137,740,000 . Accordingly, the Company has not generated cash flows
from operations, and since inception the Company has relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings
of the Company’s equity securities, sales of investments and warrant exercises as the primary sources of financing to fund the
Company’s operations. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 746,000 . Based on the
Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents, and history of losses, there is substantial doubt as to whether the Company’s
existing cash resources are sufficient to enable the Company to continue its operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. Management
plans to pursue possible financing and strategic options including, but not limited to, obtaining additional equity financing, and the
exercising of warrants by warrantholders. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in pursuing these plans.
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities
that may be necessary in the event the Company can no longer continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.
NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Company’s interim condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
and applicable rules of the SEC regarding interim reporting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated during consolidation.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
All figures are in United States dollars unless
otherwise noted.
The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary
for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are inherent
in the preparation of the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, operating results for the
three months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending October
31, 2023 or any future period.
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies are defined
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 26, 2023.
Other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and
the SEC did not or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 4 – SOUTH32 OPTION AGREEMENT
On June 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries
Minera Metalin and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. entered into the South32 Option Agreement
with South32, a wholly-owned subsidiary of South32 Limited (ASX/JSE/LSE:
S32), whereby South32 was able to obtain an option to purchase
70 % of the shares of Minera Metalin.
9
On October 11, 2019, the Company and its
subsidiary Minera Metalin issued a notice of force majeure to South32 pursuant to the South32 Option Agreement. Due to a blockade by a
cooperative of local miners called Sociedad Cooperativa de Exploración Minera Mineros Norteños, S.C.L. (“Mineros Norteños”),
the Company halted all work on the Sierra Mojada Property. The notice of force majeure was issued because of the blockade’s impact
on the ability of the Company and its subsidiary Minera Metalin to perform their obligations under the South32 Option Agreement. Pursuant
to the South32 Option Agreement, any time period provided for in the South32 Option Agreement was to be generally extended by a period
equal to the period of delay caused by the event of force majeure.
On August 31, 2022, the South32 Option Agreement
was mutually terminated by South32 and the Company. No portion of the equity value of the Company has been classified as temporary equity
as the South32 Option has no intrinsic value. South32 paid $ 518,000
to the Company as a final payment for the exploration costs incurred
by the Company during the blockade and the Company released South32 from all of claims as of the date of termination.
As of March 16, 2023, the blockade by Mineros
Norteños at, on and around the Sierra Mojada Property is ongoing.
N OTE
5 – NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company had stock options and warrants
outstanding at January 31, 2023 and 2022 that upon exercise were issuable into
5,165,039
and
2,015,039
shares of the Company’s common
stock, respectively. They were not included in the calculation of loss per share because they would have been anti-dilutive.
NOTE 6 – DUE FROM RELATED PARTY
As of January 31, 2023, due from related party
consists of $ 10,882
(October 31, 2022 - $ 23,196 ) due from Arras for shared employees’ salaries and office expenses. This amount
is non-interest bearing and is to be repaid on demand.
NOTE 7 – VALUE-ADDED TAX RECEIVABLE
Value-added tax (“VAT”) receivable
relates to VAT paid in Mexico. The Company estimates that net VAT of $ 128,070
(October 31, 2022 - $ 127,036 ) will be received and
believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue
its VAT recovery efforts. While the Company continues to pursue recovery from the Mexican government, the outcomes and process
for recovering VAT
can be lengthy and unpredictable based on the continued failure to
recover the VAT receivable and a recent preliminary unfavorable ruling from the Mexican tax authority, which the Company is in the
process of challenging.
The allowance for uncollectible VAT was estimated by management based upon a number of factors,
including the length of time the returns have been outstanding, responses received from tax authorities, general economic conditions
in Mexico and estimated net recovery after commissions.
A summary of the changes in the allowance for
uncollectible VAT for the three months ended January 31, 2023 is as follows:
Allowance for uncollectible VAT – October 31, 2022
$ 449,219

NOTE 9 – PROPERTY CONCESSIONS
The following is a summary of the Company’s
property concessions for the Sierra Mojada Property as at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 202:
Property concessions – October 31, 2022
$ 5,019,927
Impairment
( 15,541 )
Property concessions – January 31, 2023
$ 5,004,386
During the
three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company decided to withdraw certain concessions’ applications in Sierra Mojada, Mexico.
As a result, the Company no longer has the right to these property concessions and the value in use is $ nil . Accordingly, the Company
has written off the capitalized property concession balance related to these concessions of $ 15,541
in accordance with level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy.
If the blockade at Sierra Mojada Property continues
then further impairment of property concessions is possible.
NOTE 10 – LOAN PAYABLE
In June 2020, the Company received $ 29,531
($CDN
40,000 )
in the form of a Canada Emergency Business Account (“CEBA”) loan. CEBA is part of the economic assistance program launched
by the Government of Canada to ensure that businesses have access to capital during the COVID-19 pandemic that can only be used to pay
non-deferrable operating expenses. During the period from receipt of the CEBA loan to
December 31, 2022
(the “Initial Term”),
no interest will be charged on the principal amount outstanding. If at least $CDN
30,000
is repaid on or before the end of the Initial
Term, the remaining $CDN
10,000
of principal will be forgiven pursuant to the terms of the CEBA loan. During the period from
January 1,
2023
to
December 31, 2025
(the “Extended Term”), if any portion of the loan remains outstanding, interest will be payable
monthly at a rate of
5 % per annum on the outstanding principal balance.
In January 2021, the Company received an additional
$ 15,615
($CDN
20,000 ) CEBA loan. Fifty percent ( 50 %) of the additional loan is forgivable if repaid by
December 31, 2022 . The loan accrues
no interest before the end of the Initial Term, and thereafter converts to a three-year term loan with a
5 % annual interest rate. Any
portion of the loan is repayable without penalty at any time prior to
December 31, 2025 . The total CEBA loan amount stands at $CDN
60,000
with $CDN
20,000
forgivable if repaid by December 31, 2022. In January 2022, the repayment deadline for CEBA loan to qualify for loan
forgiveness had been extended to
December 31, 2023 .
The balance of the CEBA loan is fully repayable on
or before the end of the Extended Term, if not repaid on or before the end of the Initial Term. The Company anticipates repaying the CEBA
loan prior to the Initial Term date. An income will be recognized in the period when the CEBA loan is forgiven.

NOTE 14 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value Measurements
All financial assets and financial liabilities
are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs are expensed when they are incurred, unless they are directly attributable
to the acquisition of financial assets or the assumption of liabilities carried at amortized cost, in which case the transaction costs
adjust the carrying amount.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
Level 3
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
Under fair value accounting, assets and liabilities
are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, due from related party and loan payable.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts payable and due from related party approximate fair value at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 due to the short
maturities of these financial instruments. Loan payable is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty
to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Company by failing to discharge its obligations. To mitigate exposure to
credit risk on financial assets, the Company has established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure that counterparties demonstrate
acceptable levels of creditworthiness.
13
The Company maintains its U.S. dollar and Canadian
dollar cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions with high credit standings. Cash
deposits held in Canada are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (“CDIC”) for up to $CDN
100,000 . Certain Canadian
bank accounts held by the Company exceed these federally insured limits or are uninsured as they relate to U.S. dollar deposits held in
Canadian financial institutions. As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalent balances held
in Canadian financial institutions included $ 646,005
and $ 802,761 , respectively, which was not insured by the CDIC. The Company has not
experienced any losses on such accounts, and management believes that using major financial institutions with high credit ratings mitigates
the credit risk to cash and cash equivalents.
The Company also maintains cash in bank accounts
in Mexico. These accounts are denominated in the local currency and are considered uninsured. As of January 31, 2023, and October 31,
2022, the U.S. dollar equivalent balance for these accounts was $ 24,897
and $ 10,702 , respectively.
As at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022,
cash and cash equivalents consist of guaranteed investment certificates of $ 377,828
and $ 369,551 , respectively, held in bank accounts.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company
will encounter difficulty in satisfying its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by forecasting
cash flows from operations and anticipating investing and financing activities. As at January 31, 2023, the Company had working capital
of $ 302,805
and cash and cash equivalents of $ 745,808
and is exposed to significant liquidity risk at this time. Furthermore, as the Company
is in the exploration stage, it will periodically have to raise funds to continue operations and intends to raise further financing through
equity offerings.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are
non-interest-bearing and are normally settled on 30-day terms.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company holds substantially all of its
cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions. The interest rates received on these
balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and cash equivalent balances during the three months
ended January 31, 2023, a
1 % decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $ 1,699
in
interest income for the period.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Certain purchases of labor, operating supplies and
capital assets are denominated in $CDN, $MXN or other currencies. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of
the Company’s operations. Specifically, the appreciation of the $MXN or $CDN against the U.S. dollar may result in an increase in
operating expenses and capital costs in U.S. dollar terms. The Company currently does not engage in any currency hedging activities.
Based on the net exposures as at January
31, 2023, a 5% depreciation or appreciation of the $CDN and $MXN against the US dollar would result in an increase and decrease,
respectively, of approximately $6,000 in the Company’s net income.
NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
The Company’s exploration activities
are subject to laws and regulations controlling not only the exploration and mining of mineral properties but also the effect of such
activities on the environment. Compliance with such laws and regulations may necessitate additional capital outlays or affect the economics
of a project, and cause changes or delays in the Company’s activities.
Property Concessions in Mexico
To properly maintain property concessions in
Mexico, the Company is required to pay a semi-annual fee to the Mexican government and complete annual assessment work.
Royalty
The Company has agreed to pay a
2 % net smelter
return royalty on certain property concessions within the Sierra Mojada Property based on the revenue generated from production. Total
payments under this royalty are limited to $ 6.875
million (the “Royalty”). To date, no royalties have been paid.
14
Litigation and Claims
Mineros Norteños
Case
On
May 20, 2014, Mineros Norteños filed an action in the Local First Civil Court in the District of Morelos, State of Chihuahua,
Mexico, against the Company’s subsidiary, Minera Metalin, claiming that Minera Metalin breached an agreement regarding the development
of the Sierra Mojada Property. Mineros Norteños sought payment of the Royalty, including interest at a rate of
6 % per annum since
August 30, 2004, even though no revenue has been produced from the applicable mining concessions. It also sought payment of wages
to the cooperative’s members since August 30, 2004, even though none of the individuals were hired or performed work for Minera
Metalin under this agreement and Minera Metalin did not commit to hiring them. On January 19, 2015, the case was moved to the Third
District Court (of federal jurisdiction). On October 4, 2017, the court ruled that Mineros Norteños was time barred from bringing
the case. On October 19, 2017, Mineros Norteños appealed this ruling. On July 31, 2019, the Federal Appeals Court upheld
the original ruling. This ruling was subsequently challenged by Mineros Norteños and on January 24, 2020, the Federal Circuit
Court ruled that the Federal Appeals Court must consider additional factors in its ruling. In March 2020, the Federal Appeals Court upheld
the original ruling after considering these additional factors. In August 2020, Mineros Norteños appealed this ruling, which appeal
the Company timely responded and objected to on October 5, 2020. On March 26, 2021, the Federal Circuit Court issued a final and
conclusive resolution, affirming the Federal Appeals Court decision. Despite the judgments in favour of the Company, Mineros Norteños
has continued to block access to the facilities at Sierra Mojada since September 2019.  The Company has filed criminal complaints
with the State of Coahuila, federal and state authorities have been contacted to intervene and terminate the blockade, and the Company
has attempted to negotiate with Mineros Norteños, without resolution to date. The Company has not accrued any amounts in its consolidated
financial statements with respect to this claim.
Notice
of Intent under the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”)
On March 2,
2023, the Company filed a
Notice of Intent with Mexico’s Directorate General of Foreign Investment to initiate a legacy NAFTA
claim under Annex 14-C of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to recover economic damages resulting from the illegal blockade of
the Sierra Mojada Property by Mineros Norteños (Note 1).
Valdez Case
On February 15,
2016, Messrs. Jaime Valdez Farias and Maria Asuncion Perez Alonso (collectively, “Valdez”) filed an action before the
Local First Civil Court of Torreon, State of Coahuila, Mexico, against the Company’s subsidiary, Minera Metalin, claiming that Minera
Metalin had breached an agreement regarding the development of the Sierra Mojada Property. Valdez sought payment in the amount of $ 5.9
million for the alleged breach of the agreement. On April 28, 2016, Minera Metalin filed its response to the complaint, asserting various
defenses, including that Minera Metalin terminated the agreement before the payment obligations arose and that certain conditions precedent
to such payment obligations were never satisfied by Valdez. The Company and the Company’s Mexican legal counsel asserted all applicable
defenses. In May 2017, a final judgment was entered finding for the Company, the defendant, acquitting the Company of all of the plaintiff’s
claims and demands. However, due to a technicality in an early procedural act, Valdez was allowed to, and did, challenge the judgment
before a local Appeals Court. On October 1, 2020, the Appeals Court entered a resolution overturning the previous judgment and entering
a resolution in favor of Valdez in the amount of $ 5
million, plus court costs. In November 2020, the judgment of the Appeals Court was
timely challenged by the Company by means of an “Amparo” lawsuit (Constitutional protection) before a Federal Circuit Court.
In June 2021, the Federal Circuit Court ruled in favour of the plaintiff. The Company believes these judgments are contrary to applicable
law. The plaintiff initiated proceedings to enforce the Appeals Court resolution, and the Company has offered a mining concession as a
payment in full to terminate this controversy definitively. The Company believes the likelihood of the plaintiff succeeding in collecting
any amount on this claim is remote, as such the Company has not accrued any amounts in its consolidated financial statements with respect
to this claim.
From time to time,
the Company is involved in other disputes, claims, proceedings and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
intends to vigorously defend all claims against the Company and pursue its full legal rights in cases where the Company has been harmed.
Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, in the
opinion of management, based upon current information, no other currently pending or overtly threatened proceeding is expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration
Stage Companies
Silver Bull is an exploration stage company
and does not currently have any known reserves and cannot be expected to have reserves unless and until a feasibility study is completed
for the Sierra Mojada concessions that shows proven and probable reserves. There can be no assurance that these concessions contain proven
and probable reserves, and investors may lose their entire investment. See the sections titled “Risk Factors” in this Form
10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
Business Overview
Silver Bull, incorporated in Nevada, is an
exploration stage company, engaged in the business of mineral exploration, and its primary objective is to define sufficient mineral reserves
on the Sierra Mojada Property to justify the development of a mechanized mining operation. The Company conducts its operations in Mexico
through its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries, Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. (“Minera Metalin”) and Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A.
de C.V. On August 26, 2021, the wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V.
merged with and into Minera Metalin. As noted above, the Company has not established any reserves at the Sierra Mojada Property, and it
is in the exploration stage, and may never enter the development or production stage.
On August 12, 2020, the Company entered
into an option agreement (the “Beskauga Option Agreement”) with Copperbelt AG, a corporation existing under the laws of Switzerland
(“Copperbelt Parent”), and Dostyk LLP, an entity existing under the laws of Kazakhstan and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Copperbelt
Parent (the “Copperbelt Sub,” and together with Copperbelt Parent, “Copperbelt”), pursuant to which it had the
exclusive right and option (the “Beskauga Option”) to acquire Copperbelt’s right, title and 100% interest in the Beskauga
property located in Kazakhstan (the “Beskauga Property”), which consists of the Beskauga Main project (the “Beskauga
Main Project”) and the Beskauga South project (the “Beskauga South Project,” and together the Beskauga Main Project,
the “Beskauga Project”). The transaction contemplated by the Beskauga Option Agreement closed on January 26, 2021.
On February 5, 2021, Arras Minerals Corp. (“Arras”)
was incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver Bull. On March 19, 2021, pursuant to an asset purchase
agreement with Arras, the Company transferred its right, title and interest in and to the Beskauga Option Agreement, among other things,
to Arras in exchange for 36,000,000 common shares of Arras. On September 24, 2021, Silver Bull distributed to its shareholders
one
Arras common share for each Silver Bull share held by such shareholders, or
34,547 ,838 Arras
common shares in total (the “Distribution”), and Arras became a stand-alone company.
Silver
Bull’s principal office is located at 777 Dunsmuir Street, Suite 1605 Vancouver, BC, Canada V7Y 1K4, and the telephone number is
604-687-5800.
Recent Developments
Commencement of Legacy North American
Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) Claim
On March 2, 2023, the Company filed the NAFTA
Notice of Intent. The Company has been unable to access the project since the illegal blockade commenced in September 2019. Despite numerous
demands and requests for action by the Company, Mexican governmental agencies have allowed this unlawful behaviour to continue and, as
such, failed to protect the Company’s investment. Silver Bull will be seeking to recover no less than US$178 million in damages
that it has suffered as a result of Mexico’s breach of its NAFTA obligations.

Properties
Concessions and Outlook
Sierra
Mojada Property
The focus of the Company for the remainder
of the 2023 calendar year is to continue the claim process under NAFTA in relation to the blockade at the Sierra Mojada Property.
Results
of Operations
Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 and
January 31, 2022
For the three months ended January 31, 2023,
we experienced a net loss of $346,000, or approximately $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $330,000, or approximately $0.01 per
share, during the comparable period last year. The $16,000 increase in net loss was primarily due to a $22,000 increase in exploration
and property holding costs, which was offset by $4,000 in other income compared to $4,000 in other expense compared to the same period
last year as described below.
Exploration and Property Holding Costs
Exploration and property
holding costs increased $22,000 to $136,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $114,000 for the comparable period
last year. This increase was mainly due to a $16,000 concessions’ impairment as a result the Company’s decision to withdraw
certain concessions’ applications and
write off the capitalized property concession balance
for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
General and Administrative Expenses
The Company recorded general and administrative
expenses of $212,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to $211,000 for the comparable period last year. The $1,000
increase was mainly the result of a $15,000 increase in directors’ fees and a $2,000 increase in the provision for uncollectible
VAT, which was offset by a $3,000 decrease in personnel costs and an $12,000 decrease in professional services as described below.
Stock-based compensation was a factor in the
fluctuations in general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded $53,000 in stock-based compensation included in general and
administrative expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $nil for the comparable period last year
as a result of no stock options were granted and vested to employees, directors and consultants.
Personnel costs decreased $3,000 to $89,000
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to $92,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease was mainly due to
a $44,000 decrease in salaries due to revised agreements with the Company’s management in January 2022, which was offset by a $41,000
increase in stock-based compensation compared to the same period last year.
Office and administrative costs of $35,000
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were similar to the $35,000 in such costs for the comparable period last year.
Professional fees decreased $12,000 to $47,000
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $59,000 for
the comparable period last year.
This decrease was mainly due to a $14,000 decrease in legal fees, which was offset by a $2,000 increase in accounting fees.
Directors’
fees increased $15,000 to $34,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to $19,000 for the comparable period last year.
This increase was primarily due to a
$12,000 increase in stock-based compensation and a $3,000 increase in directors fee compensation
as a result of revised chairman fees compared to the same period last year.
We recorded a $8,000 provision for uncollectible
VAT for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to a $6,000 provision for uncollectible VAT in the comparable period last
year. The allowance for uncollectible VAT was estimated by management based upon a number of factors, including the length of time the
returns have been outstanding, responses received from tax authorities, general economic conditions in Mexico and estimated net recovery
after commissions.
20
Other Income (Expenses)
We recorded other income of $4,000 for the three months
ended January 31, 2023 as compared to other expenses of $4,000 for the comparable period last year. The significant factors contributing
to other income was $6,000 in interest income for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The significant factors contributing to other
expense was a $4,000 foreign currency transaction loss for the comparable period last year.
Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
During the three months ended January 31, 2023,
we primarily utilized cash and cash equivalents to fund general and administrative expenses and exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada
Property. As a result of the
exploration activities and general and administrative expenses, cash
and cash equivalents decreased from $887,000
at October 31, 2022 to $746,000 at January 31, 2023.
Cash flows used in operating activities for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $141,000, as compared to $436,000 for the comparable period in 2022. This decrease was mainly
due to the
decreased general and administrative expenses and the timing of certain payments .
Cash flows provided by investing activities
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $nil. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the three months ended January
31, 2022 were proceeds of $470,000 from the sale of 600,000 Arras common shares at a price of $CDN 1.00 per share.
Cash flows provided by financing activities
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $nil.
Capital Resources
As of
January 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $746,000, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $887,000 as of October
31, 2022. The decrease in liquidity and working capital were primarily the result of the exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Property
and general and administrative expenses.
Since the Company’s inception in November
1993, it has not generated revenue and have incurred an accumulative deficit of $137,740,000. Accordingly, Silver Bull has not generated
cash flows from operations, and since inception has relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings
of the Company’s equity securities, warrant exercises, sale of investments, and funding from South32 as the primary sources of
financing to fund our operations. Based on the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents, and history of losses, there is substantial
doubt as to whether its existing cash resources are sufficient to enable it to continue operations for the next 12 months as a going
concern. Management plans to pursue possible financing and strategic options, include, but are not limited to, obtaining additional equity
financing and the exercise of warrants by warrantholders. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be
successful
in pursuing these plans.
Any
future additional financing in the near term will likely be in the form of the issuance of equity securities, which will result in dilution
to Silver Bull’s existing shareholders. Moreover, the Company may incur significant fees and expenses in the pursuit of a financing
or other strategic transaction, which will increase the rate at which its cash and cash equivalents are depleted.
Capital Requirements and Liquidity; Need
for Additional Funding
The Company’s
management and board of directors monitor overall costs, expenses, and financial resources and, if necessary, will adjust planned operational
expenditures in an attempt to ensure that the Company has sufficient operating capital. Management continues to evaluate the Company’s
costs and planned expenditures, including for the Sierra Mojada Property, as discussed below.
The aforementioned NAFTA claim process will
require the Company to incur significant expense and devote significant resources. Outcomes in NAFTA arbitration and the process for recovering
funds, even if there is a successful outcome in NAFTA arbitration, can be lengthy and unpredictable. Furthermore, there is a risk that
the Company will be unable to secure the necessary funding to advance its claim.
21
In January 2023, Silver Bull’s board
of directors approved a calendar year 2023 budget of $0.3 million for the
Sierra Mojada Property
and $0.7 million
for general and administrative expenses for calendar year 2022. The focus of the
Company’s 2023 calendar year program at the Sierra Mojada Property will be to maintain its property concessions in Mexico. As of
February 28, 2023, the Company had approximately $0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. To maintain the Sierra Mojada Property and
NAFTA claim ultimately will require the Company to raise additional capital, identify other sources of funding or identify another strategic
partner.
Management
will continue to evaluate the Company’s ability to obtain additional financial resources, and will attempt to reduce or limit expenditures
on the Sierra Mojada Property as well as general and administrative costs if determined that additional financial resources are unavailable
or available on terms that management determine are unacceptable. However, it may not be possible to reduce costs, and even if management
is successful in reducing costs, the Company still may not be able to continue operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. If
the Company is unable to fund future operations by obtaining additional financial resources, including an equity offering or other strategic
transaction,
management do not expect to have sufficient available cash and cash equivalents to
continue the Company’s operations for the next 12 months as a going concern.
Criti cal
Accounting Policies
The critical accounting policies are defined
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 26, 2023.
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC did not or are not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES .
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of January 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of
January 31, 2023.
The Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended January 31, 2023,
there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies
to the Company’s financial statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal
proceedings in which it is involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
The risk factor outlined below should be considered
along with the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
The Company has litigation risk with
respect to its legacy North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) claim under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
and other possible proceedings.
The Company is currently, and may in the
future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. On March 2 2023, the Company filed a Notice of
Intent with Mexico’s Directorate General of Foreign Investment to initiate a legacy NAFTA claim under Annex 14-C of the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to recover economic damages resulting from the illegal blockade of the Sierra Mojada Project
by Mineros Norteños. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company
in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. While the Company believes its legacy
NAFTA claim is valid, litigation matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in
its assessment, or that the likely outcome of this matter will be consistent with the ultimate resolution of the matter. The NAFTA
claim process will require the Company to incur significant expense, devote significant resources, and may generate adverse
publicity, which could materially, and possibly adversely, affect its business. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights
and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the
Company’s outlook. Outcomes in NAFTA arbitration and the process for recovering funds even if there is a successful outcome in
NAFTA arbitration can be lengthy and unpredictable. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Company will be unable to secure the
necessary funding to advance its claim.

AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
