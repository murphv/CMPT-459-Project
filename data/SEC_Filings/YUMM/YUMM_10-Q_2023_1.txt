NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
a. Summary of Business
The Company was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada on June 10, 1998 and commenced it business as consulting, training and event Management Company through its
subsidiary.
b. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as promulgated in the United States
of America.
c. Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
d. Net Loss Per Share
The net loss per share calculation is
based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Net loss per common share is computed
pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock
during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements,
stock options and warrants. There were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
e. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
f. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
ASC 820-10 requires entities to disclose
the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it
is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of certain financial
instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.
6
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The
three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 - Quoted market prices available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.),
and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated
inputs).
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect
our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s financial instruments
are consisted principally of accrued expenses and short term debt. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying
balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature.
g. Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU
2017-01,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.    This ASU clarifies the definition
of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This
new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
periods. The adoption of this ASU has had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU
2017-04,
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) . This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating
the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which required computing the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the amendments in
this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting
unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
This new guidance will be effective January 1, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential effect that the
adoption of this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations.
7
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09,
Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.  This ASU clarifies an entity’s ability
to modify the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award presented. An entity should account for the effects of a modification
unless all the following are met: the fair value of the modified award has not changed from the fair value on the date of issuance; the
vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original
award is modified; and, the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the
classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. This new guidance will be effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The adoption of this ASU has had
no material impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable
Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception .
This ASU clarifies the recognition, measurement, and effect on earnings per share of certain freestanding equity-classified financial
instruments that include down round features affect entities that present earnings per share in accordance with the guidance in Topic
260,
Earnings Per Share . When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments,
a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own
stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. This new guidance will be effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted this
ASU and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
h. Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Yummies, SG. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated.
i.
Related Party Revenue and Accounts Receivable
There was no revenue generated from the Company
during the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The total amount earned is an account receivable at year end and remains uncollected
as of the audit date.
2. Risks and Uncertainties
In December 2019, a novel strain of
coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused
significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally.
Because COVID-19 infections have been
reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations
and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued
in the future. As a result, all of our offices have been closed effective April 1, 2020.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of
the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may
result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial
impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.
The measures taken to date will impact
the Company’s business for the fiscal third quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments,
across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s
business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.
8
3. Issuance of Common Stock
On December 17, 2018, the Company amended
and restated its articles of incorporation. The authorized shares of common stock were increased from
50,000,000
shares to
450,000,000
shares and the par value was changed from $ 0.001
to $ 0.0001
per share. The change has been reflected retroactively in the accompanying
financial statements. In addition, the Company authorized the issuance of
50,000,000
shares of preferred stock having a par value of $ 0.0001
per share. As of December 31, 2020, no preferred shares have been issued.
In February 2019, pursuant to an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”) provided by Section 4(a)(2)
and Regulation S thereunder, the Company sold
446,472,607
shares of its common stock at a price of $ 0.0001
per share for an aggregate
price of $ 44,647 . Issuance costs of $ 45,725
were offset against additional paid in capital in the accompanying financial statements.
In October, 2019, the Company issued
3,527,393
shares of its $. 0001
par value common stock for an aggregate price of $ 352.74 .
In August 2020, the Company issued
121,500
shares of its $. 0001
par value common stock for an aggregate price of $ 12.15 .
4. Warrants and Stock Options
No options or warrants are outstanding
to acquire the Company’s common stock.
5. Income Taxes
The Company has no taxable income under
Federal or State tax laws. The Company has loss carry forwards totaling $ 297,005
during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022
that may be offset against future federal income taxes.
If not used, the carry forwards will expire between 2022 and 2038.
Due to the
Company being in the development stage and incurring net operating losses, a valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred
tax assets from the net operating losses to zero. Therefore, there are no tax benefits recognized in the accompanying statement of operations.
The income tax effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have been completed in accordance with FASB ASC740.
6. Going Concern
As
shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 10,687
during the three months ended December 31,
2022 and accumulated losses of $ 297,005
since inception at June 10, 1998 . The Company’s current assets exceed its current
liabilities by $ 9,348
at December 31, 2022. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through
the issuance of common stock and the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
7. Subsequent Events
Management has evaluated subsequent
events through January 31, 2023, the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued.

Overview
The Company was originally incorporated in the
State of Nevada on June 11, 1998. The Company was formed with the stated purpose of engaging in the business of the rental of boats and
personal water craft but was not successful in that business. For the past number of years, the Company has checked the “shell company”
box on the cover page of its Form 10-K annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On August 29, 2018, the Company entered into and
closed the transactions contemplated by a stock purchase agreement between the Company, Wei-Hsien Lin, and Susan Santage, the sole director,
President, Treasurer, Secretary and controlling stockholder of the Company prior to that date. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement,
Mr. Lin purchased 1,690,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Ms. Santage for $325,000, or $0.19231 per share. Such shares
represented approximately 67.5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock as of the closing. Accordingly, as a result
of the transaction, on August 29, 2018, there was a change of control of the Company and Mr. Lin became the controlling stockholder of
the Company.
In connection with the closing of the stock purchase
transaction, Susan Santage resigned from all offices of the Company that she held and Mr. Wei-Hsien Lin was appointed as the President,
Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company, effective as of August 29, 2018. Mr. Lin was also appointed to the board of directors (the “ Board ”)
of the Company effective as of August 29, 2018. Ms. Santage resigned from the board of directors of the Company effective automatically
on the 10 th
day following the Company’s filing and mailing of an information statement on Schedule 14f-1. Such information
statement was mailed on August 31, 2018, so Ms. Santage’s resignation was effective as of September 10, 2018.
On
May 7,
2019, the Board of Directors of the Company, by written consent determined to increase the size of the Board to three (3) members and
appointed Ms. Chi-Yin Lee and Ms. Yu-Jo Liao to the Board to fill the vacancies on the Board created by the increase.
10
On June 18, 2019, the Company formed a wholly
owned subsidiary under the laws of Singapore, Yummies Knowledge Management Pte. Ltd., or the Singapore Subsidiary. The Singapore Subsidiary
is authorized to issue 5,000 ordinary shares, denominated in Singapore dollars, all of which have been issued to the Company and are outstanding.
The address of the Singapore Subsidiary is 82 Lorong 23 Geylang, #06-05, Atrix Building, Singapore 88409, and the telephone number is
+65 6338 8801. The Managing Director of the Singapore Subsidiary is Mr. Wei-Hsien Lin, who is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of the Company.
The principal activities of the Singapore Subsidiary
are in the field of management consultancy services and the provision of corporate training programs and motivational courses in various
areas of management. More specifically, the Singapore Subsidiary has begun assisting an affiliated company, Doers Knowledge Management
Pte Ltd (“ Doers Singapore ”), a private Singapore based company owned by Mr. Lin, with marketing, promotional and management
training activities relating to an event organized by Doers Singapore titled “Heartland Enterprises: Transform and Thrive,”
a Bintan Island cruise for up to 150 entrepreneur-attendees took place from July 26 to July 28, 2019 on the cruise ship Genting Dream
(the “ Heartland Event ”). The Singapore Subsidiary will provide similar services to future educational cruises and other
programs to be sponsored by Doers Singapore and is being paid for the services it provides to Doers Singapore. Immediately following this
Bintan Island cruise, the Singapore Subsidiary began providing educational site visits to entrepreneurs who have participated in the cruise
and to sponsor related business development skill building seminars, all of which are expected to generate revenues to the Singapore Subsidiary.
The Singapore Subsidiary will also sponsor its own educational programs separate from those of Doers Singapore.
As a result of the formation
of the Singapore Subsidiary and the Singapore Subsidiary’s beginning of its business activities as described above, as of June 25,
2019, the Company ceased to be a “shell company,” as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On July 1, 2019, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the
Board had made the determination that the Company had left shell company status on June 25, 2019. As such, in its future periodic reports
to be filed with the SEC beginning with this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company will change the reporting of its status as a shell
company and will check the box to indicate that the Company is not a shell company.
Recent Events
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant
disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally. On March 11, 2020,
the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with
confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19
pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an
extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
The measures taken to date will impact the Company’s
business for the fiscal third quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its
geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business
and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.
Going Concern
As shown
in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $10,687 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
accumulated losses of $297,005 since inception at June 10, 1998 . The Company’s current assets exceed its current liabilities
by $9,348 at December 31, 2022. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance
of common stock and the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company”
under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:
● have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding
mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial
statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
● submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay”
and “say-on-frequency;” and
● disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation
and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an “emerging growth company”
for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed
$1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which
would occur if the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of
our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt
during the preceding three year period.
Results of Operations
The Company
is a development stage company and conducted the following operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
The Company’s revenues for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0 and $0, respectively.
General and administrative expenses for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 were $10,687, as compared to $11,138 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an approximately 4%
decrease.
As a result of the foregoing factors, we had a
net loss of $10,687 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $11,138 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had minimal
current assets of $18,348 to fund its operations. The Company intends to maintain its operations in a manner which will minimize expenses
but believes that present cash resources are not sufficient for its operations for the next 12 months. However, it believes that present
officers and stockholders will provide any necessary funds through either the purchase of stock or loans to the Company. However, management
could be incorrect in its belief and no commitment has been made by any party to further fund the Company’s operations.
12
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,687
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $11,138 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Net cash generated
from financing activities was $1,300, mainly due to the amount contribution from a shareholder.
We had no investing activities in the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December
31, 2021. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer determined
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that
we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes.
There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II
OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these, or other matters, may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as discussed below, we
are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or operating results.
On June 4, 2021, a shareholder of the Company
filed an application for appointment of custodian (the “Application”) in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”)
claiming that the Company had abandoned its business. The Application was granted by the Court which issued a Custodian Order on June
16, 2021. On June 18, 2021, we filed an application for a stay of the Court order granting the custodianship and this stay was granted
by the Court on June 20, 2021. On June 29, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with the shareholder pursuant to which, among
other things, we agreed to maintain our corporate filings with the Nevada Secretary of State in a timely manner and to comply with regulatory
and market required periodic report filing requirements. On June 30, 2021, the Court vacated the Custodian Order and dismissed the shareholder’s
action in its entirety. We have paid an upfront of $25,000 for the legal fees for handling the case. As a result, on July 1, 2021, our
legal representative have paid on behalf of the Company of $2,500 for of the final settlement with the shareholder. The surplus of the
legal fees of $5,199 has also been refunded on July 27, 2021.
