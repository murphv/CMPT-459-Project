Basis of Presentation The unaudited interim financial statements of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) included herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules and regulations, some information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been shortened or omitted. Management believes that all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and the results of operations for the periods shown have been made. All adjustments are normal and recurring. Management also believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate, and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual amounts may differ from these estimates. These financial statements should be read together with the Company’s audited financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”).

Acquisition BNY Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc.
On November 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in BNY Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries “Alcentra”) from The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, for cash consideration of $ 587.3  million, which includes $ 188.3  million for certain securities held in Alcentra’s collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”); deferred consideration of $ 60.4  million due November 1, 2023; and contingent consideration to be paid upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds over the next four years of up to $ 350.0  million that has an acquisition-date fair value of $ 24.6  million. The consideration paid at close was funded from existing cash. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Estimated Fair Value as of November 1, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 93.6   Receivables 57.2   Investments 285.3   Goodwill 152.6   Indefinite-lived intangible assets 89.9   Definite-lived intangible assets 55.7   Other assets 9.0   Compensation and benefits and other liabilities ( 71.0 ) Total Identifiable Net Assets $ 672.3   The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to change during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. At this time, the Company does not expect material changes to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed; however, deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially change due to the use of
preliminary valuation assumptions.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected growth opportunities from the combined operations and is not deductible for tax purposes. The definite-lived intangible assets relate to acquired investment management contracts and trade names, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from
3.0
years to
10.0
years. Amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets was $ 2.3  million for the period ended December 31, 2022.
These assets had a weighted-average remaining useful life of
5.1
years at December 31, 2022, with estimated remaining amortization expense as follows: 9 Table of Contents (in millions) for the fiscal years ending September 30, Amount 2023 (remainder of year) $ 10.5   2024 14.0   2025 14.0   2026 3.9   2027 2.9   Thereafter 8.1   Total $ 53.4   Costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were $ 14.1  million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Alcentra contributed $ 27.7  million of revenue and did not have a material impact to net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. for the period ended December 31, 2022. Consequently, the Company has not presented pro forma combined results of operations for this acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company on December 15, 2022 entered into repurchase agreements with a third-party financing company for certain securities held by the Company in Alcentra’s CLOs. As of December 31, 2022, other liabilities includes repurchase agreements of €125.2 million (equivalent to $ 134.0  million at December 31, 2022) and $ 40.8  million with maturity values of € 132.3  million and $ 42.4  million. The Company has pledged Alcentra investments with a carrying value of $ 198.9  million as collateral as of December 31, 2022. The repurchase agreements have contractual maturity dates ranging between 2029 to 2034. Note 3

The Company is from time to time involved in other litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of business. Management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not materially affect the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In management’s opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of December 31, 2022 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which the Company could reasonably estimate an amount. Indemnifications and Guarantees In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, the Company enters into contracts that provide for indemnifications by the Company in certain circumstances. In addition, certain Company entities guarantee certain financial and performance-related obligations of various Franklin subsidiaries. The Company is also subject to certain legal requirements and agreements providing for indemnifications of directors, officers and personnel against liabilities and expenses they may incur under certain circumstances in connection with their service. The terms of these indemnities and guarantees vary pursuant to applicable facts and circumstances, and from agreement to agreement. Future payments for claims against the Company under these indemnities or guarantees could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition. In management’s opinion, no material loss was deemed probable or reasonably possible pursuant to such indemnification agreements and/or guarantees as of December 31, 2022. 18 Table of Contents Other Commitments and Contingencies At December 31, 2022, there were no material changes in the other commitments and contingencies as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein may include forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events, financial performance and market conditions. Such statements are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and generally can be identified by words or phrases written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “depends,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or other similar words or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including pandemic-related risks, market and volatility risks, investment performance and reputational risks, global operational risks, competition and distribution risks, third-party risks, technology and security risks, human capital risks, cash management risks, and legal and regulatory risks. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q or that are incorporated by reference herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risks and uncertainties disclosed in this Form 10-Q and/or discussed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”). While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them and are cautioned against doing so. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other possible future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.
If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Form 10-Q that causes any of our forward-looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, we undertake no obligation to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revision to our forward-looking statements, to reflect any change in assumptions, beliefs or expectations, or any change in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement is based, unless required by law. In this section, we discuss and analyze the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. OVERVIEW Franklin is a holding company with subsidiaries operating under our Franklin Templeton ®
and/or subsidiary brand names. We are a global investment management organization that derives operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide. We deliver our investment capabilities through a variety of investment products, which include our sponsored funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. Related services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. We may perform services directly or through third parties. We offer our services and products under our various distinct brand names, including, but not limited to, Franklin ® , Templeton ® , Legg Mason ® , Alcentra ® , Benefit Street Partners ® , Brandywine Global Investment Management ® , Clarion Partners ® , ClearBridge Investments ® , Fiduciary Trust International™, Franklin Bissett ® , Franklin Mutual Series ® , K2 ® , Lexington Partners ® , Martin Currie ® , O’Shaughnessy ®
Asset Management, Royce ®
Investment Partners and Western Asset Management Company ® . We offer a broad product mix of fixed income, equity, alternative, multi-asset and cash management asset classes and solutions that meet a wide variety of specific investment goals and needs for individual and institutional investors. We also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis. 20 Table of Contents The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management (“AUM”). As noted in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2022, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations that can negatively impact our revenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and customers, fund sales, and the number of shareholder transactions and accounts. These arrangements could change in the future. During our first fiscal quarter, global equity markets provided positive returns reflecting indications that central banks may begin to slow the pace of monetary policy tightening, signs that elevated inflation could be softening, and strong corporate earnings in certain sectors. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index increased 7.6% and 9.9% for the quarter. The global bond markets remained positive as the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index increased 4.6% during the quarter, reflecting expectations of easing monetary policy. Our total AUM at December 31, 2022 was $1,387.7 billion, 7% higher than at September 30, 2022 and 12% lower than at December 31, 2021. Monthly average AUM (“average AUM”) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 13% from the same period in the prior fiscal year. On November 1, 2022, we acquired BNY Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Alcentra”), one of the largest European credit and private debt managers, with global expertise in senior secured loans, high yield bonds, private credit, structured credit, special situations and multi-strategy credit strategies, for cash consideration of $ 587.3  million, which includes $188.3 million for certain securities held in Alcentra’s collateralized loan obligations; deferred consideration of $ 60.4  million due November 1, 2023; and contingent consideration to be paid upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds over the next four years of up to $ 350.0  million that had an acquisition-date fair value of $ 24.6  million. The business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. We are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add complexity to our global compliance operations. Uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. We continuously perform reviews of our business model. While we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop personnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2022. 21 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended

Net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $58.5 billion of market appreciation, an $8.8 billion increase from foreign exchange revaluation, partially offset by $18.5 billion of long-term distributions. The market appreciation occurred in all asset classes with the exception of the alternative asset class and reflected positive returns in the global equity and fixed income markets. Foreign exchange revaluation from AUM in products that are not U.S. dollar denominated was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the Euro, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar and Pound Sterling. Long-term inflows decreased 34% to $70.5 billion, as compared to the prior year period, driven by lower inflows in equity, multi-asset, and fixed income open end funds, fixed income institutional separate accounts, sub-advised CITs, and equity retail separate accounts. Decreased inflows for open end mutual funds include the impact of lower reinvested distributions, which were $12.1 billion in the current year quarter, as compared to $23.5 billion in the prior year quarter. Long-term outflows decreased 2% to $81.4 billion due to lower outflows in equity open end funds and multi-asset and equity sub-advised mutual funds, partially offset by higher outflows in fixed income and alternative institutional separate accounts, fixed income open end funds, and alternative private open end funds. 23 Table of Contents (in billions) Fixed Income Equity Alternative Multi-Asset Cash Management Total for the three months ended

Net market change, distributions and other consists of $41.8 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by $30.1 billion of long-term distributions and a $1.3 billion decrease from foreign exchange revaluation. The market appreciation occurred primarily in the equity asset class, partially offset by depreciation in the fixed income asset class. The foreign exchange revaluation resulted from AUM in products that are not U.S. dollar denominated, which represented 11% of total AUM as of December 31, 2021, and was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen, Euro and Brazilian Real, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar. Long-term inflows increased 29% to $107.0 billion, as compared to the prior quarter period, due to higher inflows in all long-term asset classes including $7.4 billion in net client accounts related to the newly joined Investment Grade Credit team as well as $23.5 billion of reinvested distributions. Long-term outflows decreased 11% to $82.9 billion due to lower outflows in the fixed income and equity asset classes. Long-term outflows in the multi-asset asset class included a $3.6 billion institutional redemption.

A measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of AUM exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. We compare the relative performance of our mutual funds against peers, and of our strategy composites against benchmarks. The performance of our mutual fund products against peer group medians and of our strategy composites against benchmarks is presented in the table below. Peer Group Comparison 1 Benchmark Comparison 2 % of Mutual Fund AUM  in Top Two Peer Group Quartiles % of Strategy Composite AUM  Exceeding Benchmark as of December 31, 2022 1-Year 3-Year 5-Year 10-Year 1-Year 3-Year 5-Year 10-Year Fixed Income 45  % 44  % 39  % 69  % 27  % 40  % 50  % 90  % Equity 52  % 50  % 56  % 61  % 58  % 49  % 52  % 37  % Total AUM 3 57  % 56  % 57  % 55  % 52  % 54  % 59  % 67  % __________________ 1 Mutual fund performance is sourced from Morningstar and measures the percent of ranked AUM in the top two quartiles versus peers. Total mutual fund AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 35%, 35%, 35% and 33% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2022. 2 Strategy composite performance measures the percent of composite AUM beating its benchmark. The benchmark comparisons are based on each account’s/composite’s (strategy composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. Total strategy composite AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 56%, 56%, 55% and 47% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2022. 3 Total mutual fund AUM includes performance of our alternative and multi-asset funds, and total strategy composite AUM includes performance of our alternative composites. Alternative and multi-asset AUM represent 19% and 10% of our total AUM at December 31, 2022. Mutual fund performance data includes U.S. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and excludes cash management and fund of funds. These results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of January 10, 2023, and are subject to revision.
Past performance is not indicative of future results. For AUM included in institutional and retail separately managed accounts and investment funds managed in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. For investment funds which are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance. These performance comparisons do not reflect the actual performance of any specific separate account or investment fund; individual separate account and investment fund performance may differ.

OPERATING REVENUES The table below presents the percentage change in each operating revenue category. (in millions) Three Months Ended
December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 Investment management fees $ 1,631.8  $ 1,760.5  (7  %) Sales and distribution fees 291.9  398.2  (27  %) Shareholder servicing fees 33.4  47.7  (30  %) Other 10.0  17.6  (43  %) Total Operating Revenues $ 1,967.1   $ 2,224.0   (12   %)
25 Table of Contents Investment Management Fees Investment management fees decreased $128.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a 13% decrease in average AUM, partially offset by higher performance fees. The decrease in average AUM occurred primarily in the fixed income and equity asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class that includes the acquisition of Lexington Partners L.P. (“Lexington”) and Alcentra. Our effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (annualized investment management fees excluding performance fees divided by average AUM) increased to 41.7 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 41.4 basis points for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Performance fees were $209.0 million and $139.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The increase was primarily due to $144.5 million of performance fees earned by Lexington, which were passed through as compensation expense per the terms of the acquisition agreement, partially offset by lower performance fees earned by our other alternative specialist investment managers. Sales and Distribution Fees Sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below. (in millions) Three Months Ended

Sales-based fees decreased $29.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a 40% decrease in commissionable sales. Shareholder Servicing Fees Shareholder servicing fees decreased $14.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to lower levels of related AUM, a reduction in fee rates charged for transfer agency services in the U.S., and fewer transactions. Other Other revenue decreased $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to lower real estate transaction fees earned by certain of our alternative asset managers.

Salaries, wages and benefits increased $10.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the recent acquisitions and a $4.3 million increase in termination benefits, which were substantially offset by the impact of headcount reductions. Incentive compensation decreased $21.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to lower incentive compensation at specialist investment managers and lower expectations of our annual performance, offset in part by the recent acquisitions, and an increase in expense for deferred compensation awards, due in part to an increase in annual acceleration for retirement-eligible employees. Acquisition-related retention expenses increased $23.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the acquisitions of Lexington and Alcentra. Acquisition-related performance fee pass through increased $144.1 million due to higher performance fees earned by Lexington. Other compensation and benefits increased $19.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to compensation related to minority interests and an increase in special termination benefits, primarily due to the acquisition of Alcentra and workforce optimization initiatives. We expect to incur additional acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately $190 million during the remainder of the current fiscal year, and annual amounts beginning at approximately $220 million in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 and decreasing over the following two fiscal years by approximately $70 million and $20 million. At December 31, 2022, our global workforce had decreased to approximately 9,400 employees from approximately 10,400 at December 31, 2021. Sales, Distribution and Marketing Sales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below.   Three Months Ended

Distribution expenses are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to certain fee structures that do not provide full recovery of distribution costs. 27 Table of Contents Sales-based expenses decreased $27.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 substantially due to a 40% decrease in commissionable sales. Information Systems and Technology Information systems and technology expenses decreased $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower technology depreciation.
Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $24.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to intangible assets recognized as part of the acquisition of Lexington. General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other operating expenses increased $31.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in acquisition-related expenses, a $10.1 million increase in platform and placement fees and a $6.2 million increase in professional fees.

Investments held by the Company generated net gains of $45.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily from investments in nonconsolidated funds and separate accounts and assets invested for deferred compensation plans, partially offset by net losses from investments measured at cost adjusted for observable price changes. Investments held by the Company generated net gains of $25.8 million in the prior year period, primarily from investments measured at cost adjusted for observable price changes, investments in nonconsolidated funds and separate accounts, and assets invested for deferred compensation plans. Equity method investees generated income of $33.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to various global fixed income and equity funds, as compared to income of $24.7 million in the prior year, primarily related to various global equity funds.
Net foreign currency exchange losses were $27.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net gains of $3.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound on cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by our European subsidiaries. Dividend and interest income increased $30.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher yields. Interest expense increased $11.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to accretion on Lexington deferred consideration and an increase in interest recognized on tax reserves in the current year period. Investments held by consolidated investment products (“CIPs”) generated losses of $13.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, largely related to losses on holdings of various equity and fixed income funds, partially offset by
28 Table of Contents gains on various alternative funds. Investments held by CIPs generated gains of $104.7 million in the prior year period, primarily related to gains on various holdings of alternative funds, partially offset by losses on holdings of various equity and fixed income funds. Expenses of consolidated investments products increased $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, due to activity of the funds. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio by asset class and accounting classification at December 31, 2022, excluding third-party assets of CIPs, was as follows: Accounting Classification 1 Total (in millions) Cash and

TAXES ON INCOME Our effective income tax rate was 26.3% and 21.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The rate increase for three-month period was primarily due to activity of CIPs for which there is no related tax impact, benefits in the prior year related to the release of tax reserves due to statute of limitation expiration and a decrease in foreign earnings. Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates. Changes in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.
SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for “adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP measures”). Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers.
29 Table of Contents “Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. Adjusted Operating Income We define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following: • Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. • Acquisition-related items: ◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation. ◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities. ◦ Amortization of intangible assets. ◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any. • Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the Company. • Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net. • Impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. Adjusted Operating Margin We calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following: • Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. • Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense. • Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share We define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following: • Activities of CIPs. 30 Table of Contents • Acquisition-related items: ◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation. ◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities. ◦ Amortization of intangible assets. ◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any. ◦ Write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business. ◦ Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment. • Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the Company. • Net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense. • Net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. • Unrealized investment gains and losses. • Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income. In calculating our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the impact of CIPs because it is not considered reflective of our underlying results of operations. Acquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate comparability to other asset management firms. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense related to funded deferred compensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits interest arrangements. Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted operating revenues. In addition, when calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we exclude unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses) because the related investments are generally expected to be held long term. 31 Table of Contents The calculations of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are as follows: (in millions) Three Months Ended

Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions in the current year, higher net purchases of investments by CLOs, and net purchases of investments as compared to net liquidations in the prior year. Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds from repurchase agreements, higher net proceeds from the debt of CIPs and higher net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests. 33 Table of Contents The assets and liabilities of CIPs attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to the CIPs’ assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. The debt holders of the CIPs have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the CIPs’ liabilities. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CIPs, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below. Our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:   (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,449.4  $ 4,086.8  Receivables 1,200.2  1,130.8  Investments 927.9  830.0  Total Liquid Assets $ 5,577.5   $ 6,047.6   Liability Debt $ 3,370.5  $ 3,376.4  Liquidity Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 primarily consist of money market funds and deposits with financial institutions. Liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in redeemable CIPs, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months. We utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and other products. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances, or utilize existing or new credit facilities. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to our earnings. Capital Resources We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, amounts available under the credit facility discussed below, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted commercial paper private placement program.
In prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes and to redeem outstanding notes. At December 31, 2022, Franklin’s outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,600.0 million. The notes have fixed interest rates from 1.600% to 2.950% with interest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, of $1,594.4 million. At December 31, 2022, Legg Mason’s outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,250.0 million. The notes have fixed interest rates from 3.950% to 5.625% with interest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of $1,486.8 million at December 31, 2022. Effective August 2, 2021, Franklin agreed to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee all of the outstanding notes issued by Legg Mason. The senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. The indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. In addition, the indentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity.
34 Table of Contents We maintain
a 364-day revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment of $500.0 million that matures September 2023. As of the time of this filing, there are no amounts outstanding with respect to the 364-day revolving credit facility. We have a 3-year
term loan with an aggregate commitment of $300.0 million. The 364-day revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreement contain a financial performance covenant requiring that the Company maintains a consolidated net leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no greater than 3.00 to 1.00.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012 and is unrated. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors’ willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
Uses of Capital We expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business including through acquisitions, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our products, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our common stock, and repay and service debt. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from share-based compensation, and expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business, including seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams and operations.
We typically declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We declared regular dividends of $0.30 per share during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $0.29 per share during the three months ended December 31, 2021. We currently expect to continue paying comparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors. We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is effected through open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date. The size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $14.2 million and we repurchased 0.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $21.7 million in the prior year period.
At December 31, 2022, 23.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization of 80.0 million shares approved by our Board of Directors in April 2018.
We invested $111.0 million, net of redemptions, into our sponsored products during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and redeemed $4.2 million, net of investments, in the prior year period. On September 27, 2022 we entered into a lease agreement for office space in New York City located at One Madison Avenue with occupancy expected to begin in early fiscal year 2024 with an aggregate expected commitment of $766.7 million over 16 years. This is part of an initiative to consolidate our existing office space in New York City. On November 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in BNY Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. from The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation for cash consideration of approximately $587.3 million paid at close, which includes $188.3 million for certain securities held in Alcentra’s collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”); deferred consideration of $60.4 million; and contingent consideration of up to $350.0 million to be paid upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds over the next four years that has an acquisition-date fair value of $24.6 million. We paid the purchase price from our existing cash. On December 15, 2022, we entered into repurchase agreements with a third-party financing company for certain securities held in Alcentra’s CLOs. Under the terms of the repurchase agreements, we received cash proceeds of approximately $175.0 million with pledged collateral consisting of Alcentra investments with a carrying value of $198.9 million at December 31, 2022. The repurchase agreements have contractual maturity dates ranging between 2029 to 2034. On April 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in Lexington for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion and additional payments of $750 million to be paid in cash over the next three years. A payment of $250 million is expected to be made during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 from our existing cash.
35 Table of Contents The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. Increased liquidity risks and redemptions have required, and may continue to require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. While we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. We did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Further, concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Described below are the updates to our critical accounting policies disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022.
Consolidation We consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Our VIEs are primarily investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products. As of December 31, 2022, we were the primary beneficiary of 56 investment product VIEs. Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment quarterly. Subsequent to the annual impairment tests performed as of August 1, 2022, we monitored both macroeconomic and entity-specific factors, including changes in our AUM to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no events or circumstances which would indicate that goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or definite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. While we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment. Fair Value Measurements A substantial amount of our investments are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. As of December 31, 2022, Level 3 assets represented 10% of total assets measured at fair value, which primarily related to CIPs’ investments in equity and debt securities. There were no transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three months ended December 31, 2022. 36 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no material changes from the market risk disclosures in our Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2022. Based on their evaluation, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In October 2022, the Company deployed a new financial reporting system which was designed, in part, to enhance the overall system of internal control over financial reporting through further automation and improved business processes. This system implementation was significant in scale and complexity and resulted in modification to certain internal controls. Other than the system implementation, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. For a description of our legal proceedings, please see the description set forth in the “Legal Proceedings” section in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 ‑ Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There were no material changes from the Risk Factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for fiscal year 2022. These Risk Factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our business also could be impacted by other risk factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. Further, our disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already developed or materialized. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. The following table provides information with respect to the shares of our common stock that we repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Month Total Number of
Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs October 2022 10,145  $ 21.57  10,145  24,375,706  November 2022 2,279  22.42  2,279  24,373,427  December 2022 511,600  27.27  511,600  23,861,827  Total 524,024   524,024   Under our stock repurchase program, which is not subject to an expiration date, we can repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and in private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation applicable federal securities laws. In order to pay taxes due in connection with the vesting of employee and executive officer stock and stock unit awards, we may repurchase shares under our program using a net stock issuance method. In April 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 80.0 million additional shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program.
