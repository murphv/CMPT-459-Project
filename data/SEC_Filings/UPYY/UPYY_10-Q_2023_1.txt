1. Nature
of Operations and Continuance of Business
UPAY,
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2015. By a Share Exchange Agreement dated November
4, 2015, the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Rent Pay (Pty) Ltd (“Rent Pay”), in exchange
for 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The acquisition is a capital transaction in substance and therefore has been
accounted for as a recapitalization. Rent Pay was incorporated in South Africa on February 1, 2012. Because Rent Pay is deemed to be
the acquirer for accounting purposes, the consolidated financial statements are presented as a continuation of Rent Pay and include the
results of operations of Rent Pay since incorporation on February 1, 2012, and the results of operations of the Company since the date
of acquisition on November 4, 2015. On March 2, 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Miway Finance Inc. (“Miway”),
which was determined to be a transaction between entities under common control (Note 3).
Rent
Pay operates principally in South Africa and engages in software development and licensing and provides services to the credit provider
industry.
The
recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020,
has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential
impacts to the Company’s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact
the Company’s operations and the operations of the Company’s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures,
and travel and logistics restrictions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s business, results of operations
and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited
to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s customers,
suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal
economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its potential
impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may experience adverse impacts to its business as a
result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably
estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results.
2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
a) Basis
of Presentation
These
consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is February 28. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary Rent Pay. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated
in consolidation.
b) Interim
Financial Statements
The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for
the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end February 28, 2022, have been omitted.
c) Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, and
deferred income tax asset valuations. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various
other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there
are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d) Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
includes cash on hand and cash held with banks. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or
less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
F- 6
e) Accounts
Receivable
Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at net invoice value and such receivables are non-interest bearing. Receivables are considered past
due based on the contractual payment terms. Receivables are reviewed and specific amounts are reserved if collectability is no longer
reasonably assured.
As
at November 30, 2022, the Company has recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 4,798
(February 28, 2022 - $ 1,768 ).
f) Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and any impairment in value. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the following estimated lives of the assets:
Schedule
of Use Life of Assets
Computer
equipment
3 years
Computer
software
5 years
Office
equipment
5 years
Vehicles
5 years
Furniture
and fixtures
6 years
The
Company periodically performs impairment testing on its long-lived assets either annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360. All property and equipment assets were deemed recoverable
at November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022.
g) Right-of-use
Assets
Right-of-use
assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and any impairment in value. Amortization is computed using the straight-line
method over the following estimated lives of the assets:
Schedule
of Estimated Life of Assets
Right-of-use
building
Term
of lease
Right-of-use
vehicles
5 years
The
Company periodically performs impairment testing on its long-lived assets either annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360. All right-of-use assets were deemed recoverable
at November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022.
h) Value
of Financial Instruments
The
Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy in accordance
with ASC 820, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ”. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based
on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
The
three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:
Level
1 – quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level
2 – quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level
3 – fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers
are unobservable.
Financial
instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, equity method investment, accounts payable, due to
related parties, taxes payable and notes payable. There were no transfers into or out of “Level 3” during the nine months
ended November 30, 2022, or 2021. The recorded values of all financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their
nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.
Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined
with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
i) Foreign
Currency Translation
Management
has adopted ASC 830, “ Foreign Currency Translation Matters ”, as the functional currency of the Company is the South
African rand and the reporting currency is U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange
in effect at the balance sheet date. Average rates for the period are used to translate revenues and expenses. The cumulative translation
adjustment is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
F- 7
j) Leases
Effective
March 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 842,
Leases
(“ASC 842”). This standard requires lessees to recognize
in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset representing the
Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether
the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances within the arrangement. A lease is identified where
an arrangement conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, and equipment for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. Leases which are identified within the scope of ASC 842 and which have a term greater than one year are recognized on
the Company’s balance sheet as ROU assets and lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets
are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The lease term includes any renewal
options and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required
for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the interest
rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company uses it’s incremental borrowing rate.
The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis
an amount equal to the lease payments for a similar term and in a similar economic environment. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts
to calculate the present value is typically not readily determinable. As such, significant management judgment is required to estimate
the incremental borrowing rate.
k) Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The guidance under ASC 606 is based
on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires additional
disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes
revenue by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize
revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
The
Company derives revenue through licensing its software and by collecting various transaction fees from third party debit orders.
The
Company has several revenue streams and they are recognized as below:
Branch
Setup Fees
This
is a once off, non-refundable cost that the company charges when a customer is onboarded. Revenue is recognized immediately and is collected
in the same month. This results in no accounts receivable at the end of the month as revenue is recognized and collected immediately.
Data
Migration Fees
This
only applies to a customer applying to migrate client data from a previous system to our system. We invoice for this service as soon
as data is successfully transferred, imported and verified by our customer. Revenue is recognized upon invoicing and payment is collected
within two days due to debit order mandates signed by the customer as part of the agreement. This results in no outstanding accounts
receivable as of the end of each month.
Monthly
Rental Fees
Our
software is made available on a web-based software platform and is offered as software as a service. Our agreement is an evergreen agreement
(auto-renewed) and if not terminated by a customer, remains intact. Termination may occur by either party at any point with 30 days’
notice. The monthly software rental fee is payable every month per branch. Monthly software rental fees are payable in the beginning
of each month. The monthly rental fees are invoiced during the first few days of a month and is recognized over the period of the month.
Payments are collected via debit order a few days later, prior to the end of that month, due to debit order mandate signed by the customer.
This results in no accounts receivable as invoicing and payment happens within the same month.
Development
Service Fee
We
have some clients that we do custom software development for, on some versions of our software. Here we adopt a scrum methodology with
2-week development sprints. We agree on a price per hour for development with these clients, typically through email communication. We
send an invoice for the work completed and usually get paid within the same month. On this revenue stream we do not run a debit order,
but clients need to pay invoices before we continue with the next development increment. Payments are due and revenue is recognized upon
invoicing. At times collecting payment can take up to 30 days. Unpaid invoices, if any, are recorded to accounts receivable at the end
of each month, but invoicing and payment usually happen within the same month.
F- 8
Transactional
Fees
We
offer an integrated debit order facility built into our software. When our clients (lenders) create loans with consumers, the consumer
contracts directly with us on a separate agreement. We then act as a third-party payment provider, to facilitate the repayment of loans
from the consumer to the lender by debit order. We are registered as a third-party payment provider and all payments collected on this
stream are settled by the bank directly into our bank account. We only charge a fee on successful debit order collections and retain
that fee when we distribute funds collected on behalf of consumers. The transaction fees charged for these transactions are called CTC
and they are displayed on the signed agreement that the consumer signs with us. The CTC fees are paid by the consumer, in addition to
the loan installment collected. The loan installment and CTC are collected as one amount, but the CTC is retained by us upon distribution
of funds to lenders. Revenue is recognized as each new order is processed and the transaction fee is charged. Our software system counts
and accounts for each individual transaction and its amount and this is generated on a report on our Acpas software. We use this report
to confirm the revenue recognition in our billing system. If there are any CTC that has yet to be collected at an end of a period, it
is recorded as accounts receivable.
Credit
Protection Insurance Commission
Some
insurance companies offer insurance products on loans that cover the consumer for the full repayment of their debt to the lender, in
case of unforeseen events. There is an insurance product from one of our suppliers (an insurance company) that we make available for
the insurance company on our software program. In return for making this product available the insurance company would pay us monthly
commission on premiums they received. This is a product offered by the insurance company directly to the consumer and we only make it
available on our software platform. If this option is selected when a loan is created, an additional fee is added to the loan repayment
amount. The software system calculates the insurance premiums and all premiums for a given month are paid by lenders to the insurance
company, or lenders use our payment service and instruct us to manage the payments on their behalf. After receiving the premiums and
supporting reports, the insurance company will then calculate and verify the premiums paid and premium claw back to this point and work
out the commission payable based on the premiums received. Upon collection of the premiums, the insurance company will complete their
final calculations and the insurance company will then pay all commissions earned by us and the lenders. We distribute the commission
amounts due to the lenders within two days of receiving such payments from the insurance company. Revenue is recognized upon collection
of the premiums from the consumers.
Credit
Bureau transactions
Some
credit bureaus like XDS or VeriCred, offer consumer screening products, that we make available on our software platform as integration.
Lenders can sign up for these service and access credit information of consumers that they would like to screen, directly from our software
platform. In return for making these products available on a seamless integration, we charge a fee on the products. The Company enters
into an agreement with the credit bureau and lender to the agreed fees. The agreement with the credit bureau determines the commission
fee paid or the markup to be charged on transactions by the company, as reseller. If there are any credit bureau fees that has yet to
be collected at an end of a period, it is recorded as accounts receivable.
Payroll
Transactions
Some
of our client (lenders) have arrangements with employers where these employers deduct loan installments payable to the lender from the
payroll of that employer, on behalf of the lender. The deduction is made from employees that have taken loans from the lender. We provide
these payroll lenders with adequate reporting in our software, that can be used to help identify the amounts to be deducted from each
individual consumer, with unique identifiers, which is sent to the employers. We also assist lenders to capture payments received from
employers on our software in bulk, where requested. We charge a payroll transaction fee to the lender, for each successful payment made
in a month on the system. The fee is charged as a combined amount for the payments received on payroll for that month. The payroll transaction
fees are set out and agreed to with the lender on the signed agreement they have with us. Our software system counts and accounts for
each individual payment receipted, and this is generated on a payment report on our ACPAS software. We use this report for revenue recognition
in our billing system. Revenue is recorded as a lump sum based on this report at the end of each month. If there are any payroll transaction
fees, that still needs to be recognized at an end of a period, it is recorded as accounts receivable.
l) Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “ Compensation – Stock Compensation ” and
ASC 505, “ Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees ”, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or
services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
m) Comprehensive
Income (Loss)
ASC
220, “ Comprehensive Income”,
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and
its components in the financial statements. As at November 30, 2022 and 2021, the only item that represents comprehensive income (loss)
was foreign currency translation.
F- 9
n) Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
The
Company computes earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “ Earnings per Share ”. ASC
260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. EPS is calculated
using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS if applicable is calculated by dividing
net income available to common stockholders for the period by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS would reflect the potential dilution from common shares issuable through stock options, performance-based restricted
stock units that have satisfied their performance factor and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.
o) Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of November 30, 2022, the Company does
not have revenues sufficient to execute its business plan. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements.
There is no assurance that this will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.
p) Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.
3. Acquisition
of Miway Finance Inc.
On
June 10, 2020, the Company purchased
20,000,000
shares of
Miway Finance Inc.
(“Miway”) at $0.001 per share for a purchase
price of $20,000, representing a
48.66 %
ownership interest. The Company previously accounted for its investment under the equity method.
Pursuant
to the Share Purchase and Separation Agreement described in Note 11, the Company received 3,700,000 shares of common stock of MiWay Finance,
Inc. from the former CEO on March 2, 2022, increasing the Company’s ownership interest to
57.66 % . As a result, the Company obtained
control over Miway and consolidated the balances and results of Miway effective March 2, 2022.
Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are reported at their historical carrying amounts and any difference between the proceeds transferred
is recognized in additional paid-in capital.
These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Miway since the date of acquisition and the historical accounts of the Company
since inception. The assets and liabilities of Miway acquired are as follows:

At
the time of acquisition, the Company had paid a total of $ 24,685
for its ownership interest in Miway. Upon consolidation, the difference
between the investment of $24,685 and the net assets assumed of $3,140 was recognized in additional paid-in capital.
Effective
May 31, 2022, the Company’s ownership interest in Miway decreased to
48.32 %
and the CEO of the Company became the majority shareholder
of both the Company and Miway. As a result of the common ownership, the change in control was considered a common-control transaction
and was outside the scope of the business combination guidance in ASC 805-50. The entities are deemed to be under common control as of
May 31, 2022, which was the date that the majority shareholder acquired control of the Company and Miway and, therefore, held control
over both companies.
Pursuant
to ASC 250-10 and ASC 805-50, the transaction resulted in a change in the reporting entity and was recognized retrospectively for all
periods during which the entities were under common control. For common-control transactions that result in a change in the reporting
entity and for which both receiving entity and the transferring entity were not under common control during the entire reporting period,
it is necessary to determine which entity is the predecessor. The predecessor is the reporting entity deemed to be the receiving entity
for accounting purposes in a common-control transaction. The predecessor is not always the entity that legally receives the net assets
or equity interests transferred. Comparative financial information shall only be adjusted for periods during which the entities were
under common control. Since common control between the Company and Miway did not occur until the current period, the comparative information
does not need to be combined. Accordingly, for periods in which the combining entities were not under common control, the comparative
financial statements presented are those of the entity that is determined to be the predecessor up to the date at which the entities
became under common control. The Company was determined to be the predecessor entity and, therefore, was deemed to be the receiving entity
for accounting purposes. Since the entities were consolidated immediately prior to the change of control, there was no impact from the
common control transaction.

The
Covid-19 Pandemic has and continues to have a material impact upon our business and results of operations, as follows:
COVID-19
RELATED RISKS
The
outbreak of the coronavirus may negatively impact sourcing and manufacturing of our products that we sell as well as consumer spending,
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread
throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31,
2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the
U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak
as a “pandemic”. The significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely
affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The
outbreak of the COVID-19 may adversely affect our supply chain.
The
worldwide outbreak of corona virus could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The coronavirus
outbreak may materially impact sourcing and manufacturing of our products in other countries and materials for our products that
are sourced in other countries by overseas manufacturers and in other affected regions. Travel within and into other overseas countries
may be restricted, which may impact our manufacturers’ ability to obtain necessary materials and inhibit travel of manufacturers
and material suppliers. Additionally, there are potential factory closures, inability to obtain materials, disruptions in the supply
chain and potential disruption of transportation of goods produced other countries adversely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak,
or threat or perceived threat of such outbreak. As a result, these conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.
The
outbreak of the COVID-19 may adversely affect our customers.
Further,
such risks as described above could also adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, resulting in reduced consumer spending
for our products and services we sell. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead
to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities or operations of our sourcing partners. The ultimate extent of the
impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity
of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and
other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

4.   Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer/Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
4
As
required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance in the reliability
of our report as of the end of the period covered by this report. This is because we have not sufficiently developed our segregation
of duties and we do not have an audit committee.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  We
will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis.
