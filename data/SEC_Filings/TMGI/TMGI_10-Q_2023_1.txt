The above convertible notes contain
a variable conversion feature based on the future trading price of the Company common stock. Therefore, the number of shares of common
stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is indeterminate. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of the embedded conversion
features as a derivative liability at the respective issuance dates of the notes and charged the applicable amounts to debt discounts
and the remainder to other expense. The increase (decrease) in the fair value of the derivative liability from the respective issuance
dates of the notes to the measurement dates is charged (credited) to other expense (income). The fair value of the derivative liability
of the notes is measured at the respective issuance dates and quarterly thereafter using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
Assumptions used for the calculations
of the derivative liability of the notes at November 30, 2022 include (1) stock price of $0.0067 per share, (2) exercise prices ranging
from $0.00004 to $0.0067 per share, (3) terms ranging from 0 days to 283 days, (4) expected volatility of 2,166% and (5) risk free interest
rates ranging from 2.58% to 240%.

NOTE 9 –
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. At November 30, 2022, the Company had negative working capital of $ 7,808,219
and an accumulated
deficit of $ 16,158,237 . These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
To date the Company has funded its operations
through a combination of loans and sales of common stock. The Company anticipates another net loss for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023
and with the expected cash requirements for the coming year, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue
operations.
The Company is attempting to improve
these conditions by way of financial assistance through issuances of notes payable and additional equity and by generating revenues through
sales of products and services. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Item 2. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating
to future events or our future performance. Actual results may materially differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements
as a result of certain risks and uncertainties set forth in this prospectus. Although management believes that the assumptions made and
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in
fact, prove to be correct or that actual results will not be different from expectations expressed in this report.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The Marquie Group, Inc. (“TMGI”), is
a direct-to-consumer sales and marketing company which has entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with an innovative skin care
company, Simply Whim, LLC for their WHIM® product line. The WHIM® products are designed as solutions to modern day skin nutrition
and beauty challenges by using a safe, proprietary blend of amino acids, antioxidants, and other nature-derived ingredients.
The Company markets these products through its
wholly owned subsidiary Music of Your Life, a syndicated radio network heard nationwide on AM, FM and HD terrestrial radio stations, and
simulcast over the internet. This is made possible by 30 and 60 second commercials airing every hour which are targeted toward the Music
of Your Life listening audience. Broadcasting more than 40 years, Music of Your Life is the longest running music radio format in syndication.
Expenses which comprise the
costs of goods sold will include licensing agreements and royalties, as well as operational and staffing costs related to the management
of the Company’s syndicated radio network, product development and product marketing costs. General and administrative expenses
are comprised of administrative wages; office expenses; outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees; travel and other miscellaneous
office and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses include selling/marketing wages and benefits, advertising and promotional
expenses, as well as travel and other miscellaneous related expenses.
Because we have incurred losses,
income tax expenses are immaterial. No tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carryforwards, given our uncertainty of
being able to utilize such loss carryforwards in future years. We anticipate incurring additional losses during the coming year.
RESULTS OF OPERATION
Following is management’s
discussion of the relevant items affecting results of operations for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.
Revenues . The Company
generated no net revenues during the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. Revenues in the past have been generated from
spot sales on our syndicated radio network.
Cost of Sales . Our
cost of sales were $-0- for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. Our cost of sales in the future will consist principally
of licensing costs and royalties associated with our syndicated radio network, other related services provided directly or outsourced
through our affiliates, as well as operational and staffing costs with respect thereto.
Salaries and Consulting
Fees . Accrued salaries and consulting fees were $60,000 and $30,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Accrued salaries and consulting fees were $120,000 and $60,000 for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect
that salaries and consulting expenses will increase as we add personnel to build our multi-media entertainment business.
Professional Fees.
Professional fees were $17,992 and $40,885 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Professional fees were
$56,113 and $40,885 for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Professional fees consist mainly of the fees related
to the audits and reviews of the Company’s financial statements as well as the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We anticipate that professional fees will increase in future periods as we scale up our operations.
18
Other Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses . Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $10,696 and $4,905 for the three months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $12,001 and $9,066 for the six months
ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that SG&A expenses will increase commensurate with an increase in our
operations.
Other Income (Expenses).
The Company had net other expenses of $79,920 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to net other income of $1,586,822
for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The Company had net other expenses of $91,934 for the six months ended November 30, 2022

ended November 30, 2021, the company recorded expense on the change in the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $1,556,558.
During the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, other expenses incurred were also comprised of interest expenses related to notes
payable in the amount of $133,128 and $408,524, which included the amortization of debt discounts of $14,878 and $213,361, respectively.
During the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a loss on the conversion of notes payable and accrued interest
in the amount of $-0- and $2,529,399, respectively, based on difference between the fair market value of the stock at issuance and the
amount of notes payable and accrued interest converted.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of November 30, 2022, our
primary source of liquidity consisted of $784 in cash and cash equivalents. We hold our cash reserves in a major United States bank. Since
inception, we have financed our operations through a combination of short and long-term loans, and through the private placement of our
common stock.
We have sustained significant
net losses which have resulted in negative working capital and an accumulated deficit at November 30, 2022 of $7,808,219 and $16,158,237,
respectively, which raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We generated a net loss for the six months ended November
30, 2022 of $280,048. Without additional revenues, working capital loans, or equity investment, there is substantial doubt as to our ability
to continue operations.
We believe these conditions
have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small public companies. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the ability
to (i) generate revenues and sales of our products and services at levels sufficient to cover our costs and provide a return for investors,
(ii) attract additional capital in order to finance growth, and (iii) successfully compete with other comparable companies having financial,
production and marketing resources significantly greater than those of the Company.
We believe that our capital
resources are insufficient for ongoing operations, with minimal current cash reserves, particularly given the resources necessary to expand
our multi-media entertainment business. We will likely require considerable amounts of financing to make any significant advancement in
our business strategy. There is presently no agreement in place that will guarantee financing for our Company, and we cannot assure you
that we will be able to raise any additional funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future
equity financing will likely be substantially dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect our Company
and our business and may cause us to substantially curtail or even cease operations. Consequently, you could incur a loss of your entire
investment in the Company.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Our financial statements and
related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact
on the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained
in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk, and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates
and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation
of our financial statements.
19
Our significant accounting
policies are summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements included in our May 31, 2022 Form 10-K. While all these significant accounting
policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined
to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater
degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and
circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on
our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
We recognize revenue on arrangements
in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”.  In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price
is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We have reviewed accounting
pronouncements issued during the past two years and have adopted any that are applicable to the Company. We have determined that none
had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for the periods presented in this report.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose
entities” (“SPE”s).
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risks
Not applicable because we
are a smaller reporting company.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
as a result of continuing material weaknesses (such as the absence of an audit committee and absence of qualified independent directors)
in its internal control over financial reporting. The disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective because there was no segregation
of duties. One member of our management team handles all accounting duties including the recording of transactions, paying bills and reconciling
the bank account. We have minimized this risk by having an external accountant review all transactions and make the appropriate adjustments
before the review by our external auditor.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting
There have been no changes
in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
Currently we are not aware
of any litigation pending or threatened by or against the Company.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Not applicable because we
are a smaller reporting company.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds
See Note 7 in the notes to
the financial statements.
With respect to the transactions
in Note 7 to the financial statements, each of the recipients of securities of the Company was an accredited investor or is considered
by the Company to be a “sophisticated person”, inasmuch as each of them has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of receiving securities of the Company. No solicitation was
made, and no underwriting discounts were given or paid in connection with these transactions. The Company believes that the issuance of
its securities as described above was exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
The Company has not paid the
principal and interest due on 13 notes payable aggregating $647,592 at November 30, 2022. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
