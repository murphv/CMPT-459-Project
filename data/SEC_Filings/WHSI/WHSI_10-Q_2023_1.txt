WEARABLE HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2022 (unaudited) and June 30, 2022
Note 1 –
Nature and Continuance of Operations
Wearable Healthcare Solutions Inc. (the Company)
was incorporated as Medical Alarm Concepts Holding, Inc. on June 4, 2008, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company was formed
for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the membership units of Medical Alarm Concepts LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company
(“Medical LLC”). On May 26, 2016, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of
State of the State of Nevada to change its name from “Medical Alarm Concepts, Inc.” to “Wearable Health Solutions, Inc.”
The Company provides mobile health (mHealth) products
and services to be used by customers in case of an emergency. As a provider of personal emergency devices, the Company provides innovative
wearable healthcare products, tracking services, and turn-key solutions that enable our users to be proactive with their health, as well
as safe and protected.
The Company’s flagship products are the
iHelp devices, the 3G and the next generation iHelp MAX™ – personal emergency alarm that are used to summon help in the event
of an emergency at home.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying interim consolidated financial
statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management of Wearable Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (the Company), contain all adjustments,
which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2022, and the results of
operations and changes in shareholders’ deficit for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and cash flows for the six
months ended December 31, 2022. The balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is derived from the Company’s audited financial statements.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, although management of the Company believes
that the disclosures contained in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented therein not misleading. For
further information, refer to the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on this Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
The results of operations for the three and six
months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending
June 30, 2023.
Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation
– The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiary: Medical
Alarm Concepts, LLC. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
–
The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of management’s
estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Company’s management evaluates these significant estimates and assumptions including
those related to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, stock-based compensation, income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts,
long-lived assets, and inventories, and other matters that affect the consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
– For purposes
of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.
9
Accounts Receivable
– The Company
estimates credit loss reserves for accounts receivable on an individual receivable basis. A specific impairment allowance reserve is established
based on expected future cash flows and the financial condition of the debtor. The Company charges off customer balances in part or in
full when it is more likely than not that we will not collect that amount of the balance due. The Company considers any balance unpaid
after the contract payment period to be past due. There are $ 32,911
and $- 0 - in accounts receivable net of allowances of $ 23,705
and $- 0 -
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Software Development for internal use
-
The Company accounts for software development costs in accordance with applicable guidelines. Software development costs include payroll,
employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Software
development costs also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international
markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included
in software development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached. Once technological feasibility is reached,
such costs are capitalized and depreciated over the useful estimated lives of the software. For software modifications or developments,
the Company expenses the costs. The Company purchased its dealer portal for $ 50,000
on August 30, 2021 which is being depreciated over
5
years.
Concentration of Credit Risk
-
Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses.
Recognition of Revenues
–
Recognition
of Revenues
– In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 establishes
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from outside contracts with customers and supersedes
most of the existing revenue recognition guidance and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. ASU 2014-09 requires
an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. On
August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business entities may elect to adopt the
amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company has adopted this pronouncement.
The Company’s revenues are derived principally
from utilizing new technology in the medical alarm industry to provide 24-hour personal response monitoring services and related products
to subscribers with medical or age-related conditions. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. For
hardware sales, the Company recognizes revenues at a point in time when the product is shipped. Customers are billed on Net 30 terms.
For service revenue, the Company recognizes revenues over the term of the service contract and when the services are rendered. For customers
who pay several months at a time, the Company records revenues for the month’s services and the balance of funds to deferred revenues,
and records the balance of revenues as they become current.

Deferral of revenues at December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 was $ 69,006
and $ 95,015 , respectively. The deferred revenue represents quarterly and annual prepaid service fees, which
were invoiced and paid at the onset of customer service agreements and which pertain to service obligations not realized at December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We have no agreements longer than 12 months.
10
Deferred Taxes
–
The Company accounts
for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements
of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a company to first
determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be
sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have
full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.
The Federal and state income tax returns of the
Company for 2021, 2020, and 2019 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for three (3)
years from the date filed.
Fair value of financial instruments .
The
Company measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as makes related disclosures, in accordance with FASB
Accounting Standards Codification No. 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), which provides guidance with respect to valuation
techniques to be utilized in the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. Approaches include, (i) the market approach (comparable
market prices), (ii) the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and (iii) the cost approach (cost to replace the
service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level 1 : Observable inputs such
as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 : Inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs
in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from
valuation techniques in which one more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
From time to time, our financial instruments include
cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, convertible notes, lines of credit, and credit cards.
Research and Development
-
Research and
development costs are charged to operations as they are incurred. Legal fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining and protecting
patents are also expensed as incurred, due to the uncertainty with respect to future cash flows resulting from the patents. For the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $- 0 - and $ 71,212
and $ 2,180
and $ 270,212
in research and development
costs, respectively.
Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share
-
Basic
loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period of computation. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all potential dilutive common shares
outstanding during the period of compensation. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
would then share in the net income of the Company, subject to anti-dilution limitations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,
Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The update is intended to simplify the current rules regarding
the accounting for income taxes and addresses several technical topics including accounting for franchise taxes, allocating income taxes
between a loss in continuing operations and in other categories such as discontinued operations, reporting income taxes for legal entities
that are not subject to income taxes, and interim accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for
certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s
own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments
with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion
feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the
life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument
contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument
was issued at a substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase
reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from shareholders’ equity
to liabilities as it relates to the Company’s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the
if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS), which is consistent with the
Company’s accounting treatment under the current standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective
or modified retrospective basis. The Company early adopted the ASU on July 1, 2022, the beginning of its fiscal year.
The Company reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements
issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, and they did not or are not believed by management
to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.
Note 3 –
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
the Company has shown losses for the last two years and has an accumulated deficit of ($ 40,711,940 ) and ($ 39,423,382 ), respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company has net cash used in operating activities of $ 1,055,780
as well as stock compensation non-cash expense of $ 195,266
and a net
loss of $ 1,288,558 . The Company had net cash flow of $ 1,040,191
from financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022, which
resulted in a working capital deficit of $ 2,430,294
as of December 31, 2022. If the Company is unable to raise additional adequate capital,
it could be forced to cease operations.
Management believes that the Company’s capital
requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company’s development efforts and its efforts to raise capital.
Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain the additional capital resources necessary to implement its business plan or that any assumptions relating
to its business plan will prove accurate.
These factors raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the issue date of this report. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Legal Matters
From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an
adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1)
Wearable Health Solutions, Inc. v. Barry Honig, GRQ Consultants Inc., Benza Pharma LLC and John Does 1-10, Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York, July 22, 2021. Company is disputing the validity of Notes from 3/2016 and seeking damages, reparations, and related costs.
2)
GRQ Consultants, Inc. v. Wearable Health Solutions, Inc., Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, August 26, 2021, Parties are seeking summary judgment of $50,000 plus accrued interest in response to lawsuit by Company regarding $50,000 loan from 11/2016.
3)
Benza Pharma LLC, Sandor Capital, LP, and John Lemak v. Wearable Health Solutions, Inc., District Court, Clark County, Nevada, Parties are seeking summary judgment of $3,000,000 plus accrued interest in regards to convertible notes payable from March, 2016. The Company believes that there is a very low probability that it will pay this amount and as a result has   not accrued for it on the Company’s balance sheet. (See Note 15)
4)
Medical Alarm Concepts LLC v. MCA Cure, LLC, Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County. Company is seeking return of payments for non-performance plus attorney fees and court costs. A settlement was reached between the parties whereby MCA Cure will pay an initial $10,000 and $6,500 each month until debt is satisfied in 2023 (See Note 14).
Commitments and Contingencies.
The Company
follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist
as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one
or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves
an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted
claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as
well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that
it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not
probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate
of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon
information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

Note 13 –
Office/Warehouse lease
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the current accounting for leases and while retaining two distinct types of leases, finance and operating,
(1) requires lessees to record a right of use asset and a related liability for the rights and obligations associated with a lease,
regardless of lease classification, and recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting, (2) eliminates most real
estate specific lease provisions, and (3) aligns many of the underlying lessor model principles with those in the new revenue standard.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. For public companies,
the new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities,
including emerging growth companies, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 2020.
The Company maintains its corporate office at
2901 W. Coast Highway, Suite 200, Newport Beach, CA 92663. The
Company currently pays $175 a month for its office space and the term is month-to-month. The Company’s subsidiary maintained a
warehouse office in Pennsylvania to facilitate inventory arrival and product shipment. The three-year lease at $1,100 per month expired
on September 30, 2021, and was renewed for 12 months at $1,300 per month beginning October 1, 2021 and expiring on September 30, 2022.
The subsidiary subsequently entered into a month-to-month arrangement with this office warehouse and then terminated the arrangement
and vacated the facility as of December 31, 2022. The Company entered into a new three-year lease agreement on September 9, 2022 for
new warehouse space located in Mequon, Wisconsin. The monthly rent for this new warehouse space is currently $1,325 per month for the
first twelve months of the lease agreement. Expenditures for the six months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:
Schedule lease cost
2022
2021
Rent expense
$ 12,190
$ 7,700
The Company leased a fulfillment center in the
U.S., which was classified as an operating lease which subsequently expired on September 30, 2022. The Company determines if an arrangement
qualifies as a lease at the lease inception. Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments
over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date. The Company’s real estate leases, which are for a fulfillment center,
generally have a lease term between
3
and
5
years. The Company’s leases are comprised of fixed lease payments and also include executory
costs such as common area maintenance, as well as property insurance and property taxes. The Company has elected to account for the lease
and non-lease components as a single lease component for its real estate leases. Lease payments, which may include lease components and
non-lease components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either
fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Any actual costs
in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost.
The Company’s lease agreements generally
do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to
calculate the present value of the future lease payments. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is
the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease
term. The Company’s lease agreement for its warehouse space located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania expired on September 30, 2022.
The Company has terminated the month-to-month arrangement and has vacated the warehouse located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania as of
December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company entered into a new three-year lease agreement on September 9, 2022 for new warehouse space
located in Mequon, Wisconsin. The monthly rent which commenced in September 2022 is $1,325 per month and increases approximately 3% annually
thereafter. The discount rate used was determined based on the available data as of the lease commencement date. The Right-of-use (“ROU”)
asset value added as a result of this new lease agreement was $ 43,058 . The Company’s ROU asset and lease liability accounts reflect
the inclusion of this new lease agreement on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
Certain of the Company’s lease agreements,
primarily related to real estate, include options for the Company to either renew (extend) or early terminate the lease. Leases with renewal
options allow the Company to extend the lease term typically between 1 and 3 years. Renewal options are reviewed at lease commencement
to determine if such options are reasonably certain of being exercised, which could impact the lease term. When determining if a renewal
option is reasonably certain of being exercised, the Company considers several factors, including but not limited to, significance of
leasehold improvements incurred on the property, whether the asset is difficult to replace, or specific characteristics unique to the
particular lease that would make it reasonably certain that the Company would exercise such option. In most cases, the Company has concluded
that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain of being exercised by the Company (and thus not included in the
Company’s ROU asset and lease liability) unless there is an economic, financial or business reason to do so.
19
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, total
operating lease cost was $ 12,190
and is recorded in general and
administrative expenses, dependent on the nature of the leased asset. The operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. The following summarizes (i) the future minimum undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable lease for each
of the next four years and thereafter, incorporating the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single
lease component for our existing real estate leases, (ii) a reconciliation of the undiscounted lease payments to the present value of
the lease liabilities recognized, and (iii) the lease-related account balances on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, as
of December 31, 2022:

Settlement
In 2019, the Company engaged MCA Cure to negotiate
settlements with two note holders, and paid MCA Cure a total of $97,625. In 2020, the Company discovered MCA Cure had not performed when
bank accounts were levied for $33,705 and $18,705, being subsequently refunded, and engaged an attorney to recover funds. Currently the
Company has a settlement agreement in place with Susquehanna Salt Loan and has hired an attorney to recover funds and damages from MCA
Cure. In February 2022, a settlement was reached with MCA Cure for fees and attorney costs of $ 105,125 , amortized at 1.5%, by which the
Company would receive an initial payment of $10,000, and $6,500 monthly until the debt is satisfied in May 2023, with stipulations for
any potential default. MCA Cure ceased making payments to the Company in the three month period ended December 2022, and as a result the
Company is currently in the process of reopening its legal case against MCA Cure.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company recorded $ 19,500
and $- 0 - in other income related to this settlement agreement, respectively.

Subsequent Events
The Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet
date but before the financial statements are issued and determined that there are no material events that are required to be disclosed.
On January 27, 2023, the Company terminated the employment of Jennifer
Loria, the Chief Operating Officer of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Medical Alarm Concepts, LLC.
On February 3, 2023, the plaintiffs in the case of
Sandor Capital, LP and John Lemak v. Wearable Health Solutions, Inc., informed the Company that they would be discontinuing their legal
action against the Company.
On February 7, 2023, the Company issued 2,662,500 shares valued at
$28,846 or $0.011 per share to certain members of management. These shares were recorded at the stock price of the date of agreement or
grant.

cash used in operating activities was $(1,055,780) compared to $(1,806,812) for the same period ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
in the amount of cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in the net loss resulting from the lower salaries
and wages incurred in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Cash flow from Financing Activities

23
Going Concern
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation
of the Company on a going-concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized, and liabilities are extinguished in
the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred recurring losses
from operations and has an accumulated deficit of $40,711,940 as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern depends upon its ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations through continuing investments of debt and/or equity
by qualified investors/creditors, internally generated working capital and monetization of intellectual property assets. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is currently pursuing
a business strategy which includes raising the necessary funds to finance the Company’s development and marketing efforts.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Financial Statements describes
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited
to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are
impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising
in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as
well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued
when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should
be adjusted.
We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits)
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis
of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences,
which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have
been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred
tax asset will be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12,
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in
the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard
is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for
certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s
own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments
with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion
feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the
life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument
contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument
was issued at a substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase
reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from shareholders’ equity
to liabilities as it relates to the Company’s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the
if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS), which is consistent with the
Company’s accounting treatment under the current standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective
or modified retrospective basis. The Company early adopted the ASU on July 1, 2022, the beginning of its fiscal year.
24
The Company reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements
issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, and they did not or are not believed by management
to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to
investors.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that
are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022.
The following aspects of the Company were noted
as potential material weaknesses:
1.
We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the period ended December 31, 2022; Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
2.
We do not as yet have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company’s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
3.
We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non–financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.
4.
Certain control procedures were unable to be verified due to performance not being sufficiently documented. As an example, some procedures requiring review of certain reports could not be verified due to there being no written documentation of such review. Management evaluated the impact of its failure to maintain proper documentation of the review process on its assessment of its reporting controls and procedures and has concluded deficiencies represented a material weakness.
25
In designing and evaluating disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Changes in Internal Controls
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no changes occurred in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item. 1. Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an
adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company received proceeds totaling $629,500 in connection with the issuance of 68,262,500 shares of common stock. Of the total proceeds
received, $325,000 in proceeds was received from the issuance of 37,812,500 common shares that were issued under the terms of subscription
agreements at the contract price of $0.008. The remaining proceeds of $304,500 was received from the issuance of 30,450,000 common shares
that were issued under the terms of subscription agreements at the contract price of $0.01.
The above securities were issued in reliance on
the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) since the issuance
by us did not involve a public offering. The offerings were not “public offerings” as defined in 4(a)(2) due to the insubstantial
number of persons involved in the transactions, manner of the issuance and number of securities issued. We did not undertake an offering
in which we sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent
as required by Section 4(a)(2) since they agreed to and received securities bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted
pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act. This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market
and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements
to qualify for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for these transactions.
