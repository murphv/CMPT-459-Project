Forward-looking statements are statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “should,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe” and other words of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or events. We have also included forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q concerning, among other things, our strategy, goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, liquidity and capital resources, results of operations, market position and product development. These statements are based on current estimates that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, our actual results could vary materially from our current expectations. There are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. They include: uncertainties related to changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions, including as a result of increased inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions on Russia; uncertainties related to the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of more contagious or virulent strains of the virus, its impacts on our business operations, financial results and financial position and on the industries in which we operate and the global economy generally, including as a result of travel restrictions, business and workforce disruptions associated with the pandemic; other economic recession or inflationary pressures; our ability to achieve all anticipated benefits of restructuring, simplification and modernization initiatives; Commercial Excellence growth initiatives, Operational Excellence initiatives, our foreign operations and international markets, and the impact on our business of currency exchange rates, different regulatory environments, trade barriers, exchange controls, and social and political instability, including the conflict in Ukraine; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including environmental, health and safety regulations; potential for future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property; continuity of information technology infrastructure; competition; our ability to retain our management and employees; demands on management resources; availability and cost of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products; product liability claims; integrating acquisitions and achieving the expected savings and synergies; global or regional catastrophic events; demand for and market acceptance of our products; business divestitures; energy costs; commodity prices; labor relations; and implementation of environmental remediation matters. We provide additional information about many of the specific risks we face in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other periodic reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in our forward-looking statements will be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we do not intend to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments. 3 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KENNAMETAL INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 was derived from the audited balance sheet included in our 2022 Annual Report. The interim statements are unaudited; however, we believe that all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods were made and all adjustments are normal recurring adjustments. The results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year. Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a “year” is to a fiscal year ended June 30. For example, a reference to 2023 is to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Kennametal Inc. and its subsidiaries. 2. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES Six Months Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Cash paid during the period for: Interest $ 13,430   $ 12,617   Income taxes 17,631   16,784   Supplemental disclosure of non-cash information: Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment ( 7,226 ) ( 150 ) 3.     DIVESTITURE During the year ended June 30, 2020, we completed the sale of certain assets of the non-core specialty alloys and metals business within the Infrastructure segment located in New Castle, Pennsylvania to Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. for an aggregate price of $ 24.0  million. The net book value of these assets at closing was $ 29.5
million, and the pre-tax loss on divestiture recognized during the year ended June 30, 2020 was $ 6.5
million. Transaction proceeds were primarily used for capital expenditures related to our simplification/modernization efforts. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 1.0
million on the New Castle divestiture due to proceeds held in escrow until November 2021. 4.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels to prioritize the inputs used in valuations, as defined below: Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable. 7 Table of Contents KENNAMETAL INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities are categorized as follows:   (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Derivatives
(1) $ —  $ 99   $ —  $ 99   Total assets at fair value $ —  $ 99   $ —  $ 99   Liabilities: Derivatives
(1) $ —  $ 8   $ —  $ 8   Total liabilities at fair value $ —  $ 8   $ —  $ 8     As of June 30, 2022, the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities are categorized as follows: (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Derivatives
(1) $ —  $ 176   $ —  $ 176   Total assets at fair value $ —  $ 176   $ —  $ 176   Liabilities: Derivatives
(1) $ —  $ 574   $ —  $ 574   Total liabilities at fair value $ —  $ 574   $ —  $ 574     (1)
Currency derivatives are valued based on observable market spot and forward rates and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There have been no changes in classification and transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy in the current period.
5.     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
As part of our financial risk management program, we use certain derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and, therefore, we do not hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. We account for derivative instruments as a hedge of the related asset, liability, firm commitment or anticipated transaction, when the derivative is specifically designated and qualifies as a hedge of such items. Our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow. We measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item.
There were no derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are as follows: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Other current assets - currency forward contracts $ 99   $ 176   Other current liabilities - currency forward contracts ( 8 ) ( 574 ) Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 91   ( 398 ) Total derivatives $ 91   $ ( 398 ) 8 Table of Contents KENNAMETAL INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Certain currency forward contracts that hedge significant cross-border intercompany loans are considered as other derivatives and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts are recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, with the offset to other expense (income), net.
(Gains) losses related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments have been recognized as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Other expense (income), net - currency forward contracts $ ( 197 ) $ ( 134 ) $ ( 503 ) $ 6     NET INVESTMENT HEDGES As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had certain foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans payable with total aggregate principal amounts of € 17.0
million and € 13.0
million, respectively, designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our net investment in our Euro-based subsidiaries. A loss of $ 0.4
million and a gain of $ 0.1
million were recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gains of $ 1.3
million and $ 1.4
million were recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans payable designated as net investment hedges consisted of: Instrument Notional

38
percent and
39
percent of total inventories at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Inventory valuations under the LIFO method are based on an annual determination of quantities and costs as of June 30 of each year; therefore, the interim LIFO valuations are based on our projections of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to any final year-end LIFO inventory adjustments. Inventories consisted of the following:   (in thousands) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Finished goods $ 345,529   $ 316,936   Work in process and powder blends 241,884   231,214   Raw materials 101,617   107,024   Inventories at current cost 689,030   655,174   Less: LIFO valuation ( 83,250 ) ( 84,338 ) Total inventories $ 605,780   $ 570,836   10.     LONG-TERM DEBT Fixed rate debt had a fair market value of $ 516.3

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 11.    REVOLVING AND OTHER LINES OF CREDIT AND NOTES PAYABLE During fiscal 2022, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement is a five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, which we use to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans of up to $ 700.0
million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be (1) Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) for any borrowings in euros, pounds sterling, yen, U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, respectively, plus an applicable margin, (2) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus an applicable margin, or (3) fixed as negotiated by us. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2027. The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including one financial covenant: a maximum leverage ratio where debt, net of domestic cash in excess of $ 25
million and sixty percent of the unrestricted cash held outside of the United States, must be less than or equal to
3.75
times trailing twelve months EBITDA, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement and we had $ 76.8
million of borrowings outstanding and $ 623.2
million of additional availability. We had $ 19.0
million of borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2022. Borrowings on other lines of credit and notes payable were $ 2.0
million and $ 2.2
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
12.      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operation of our business has exposed us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters. We are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain sites associated with our current or former operations.
We establish and maintain accruals for estimated liabilities associated with certain environmental matters. At December 31, 2022, the balance of such accruals was $ 12.2
million, of which $ 1.9  million was current. At June 30, 2022, the balance was $ 12.5
million, of which $ 7.9  million was current. The decrease in the current balances reflects adjustments in estimated completion timelines based on currently available information, while the composition of such accruals remains largely unchanged. These accruals are generally not discounted. We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular environmental matter is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. When a material loss contingency is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a material loss contingency is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. The accruals we have established for estimated environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs of addressing identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), other governmental agencies and by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) groups in which we are participating. The accrued liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the government or the courts on these matters. Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), under which we have been identified by the USEPA or other third party as a PRP with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and estimated liability associated with these sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals are adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at the sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable. 12 Table of Contents KENNAMETAL INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 13.      INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
17.8
percent and
25.9
percent, respectively. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a $ 2.2
million tax benefit recorded in the current year quarter related to Swiss tax reform and geographical mix. The effective income tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
23.6
percent and
26.5
percent, respectively. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a $ 2.2
million tax benefit recorded in the current year quarter related to Swiss tax reform and geographical mix. Swiss tax reform Swiss tax reform legislation was effectively enacted during the December quarter of fiscal 2020 when the Canton of Schaffhausen approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing on October 8, 2019 (Swiss tax reform). Significant changes from Swiss tax reform include the abolishment of certain favorable tax regimes and the creation of a multi-year transitional period at both the federal and cantonal levels. The transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform allow companies to utilize a combination of lower tax rates and tax basis adjustments to fair value, which are used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in deductions over the transitional period. To reflect the federal and cantonal transitional provisions, as they apply to us, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 14.5  million during the three months ended December 31, 2020. We considered the deferred tax asset from Swiss tax reform to be an estimate based on our interpretation of the legislation, which was subject to change based on further legislative guidance, review with the Swiss federal and cantonal authorities, and modifications to the underlying valuation. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we finalized the calculation of the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform after a review and receipt of a ruling from the Swiss federal and cantonal authorities and recorded a $ 2.2
million tax benefit to adjust the deferred tax asset and income tax liabilities related to fiscal years 2021 and 2022. 14.     EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while diluted earnings per share is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur related to the issuance of capital stock under stock option grants, performance awards and restricted stock units. The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share relates solely to the effect of capital stock options, performance awards and restricted stock units. The following table provides the computation of diluted shares outstanding for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Weighted-average shares outstanding during the period 80,737   83,637   81,141   83,759   Add: Unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units 500   737   536   743   Number of shares on which diluted earnings per share is calculated 81,237   84,374   81,677   84,502   Unexercised stock options with an exercise price greater than the average market price and restricted stock units not included in the computation because they were anti-dilutive 1,388   145   1,373   183   13 Table of Contents KENNAMETAL INC.

The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1943 as a manufacturer of tungsten carbide metal cutting tooling and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1967. With more than 80 years of materials expertise, the Company is a global industrial technology leader, helping customers across the aerospace, earthworks, energy, general engineering and transportation industries manufacture with precision and efficiency. This expertise includes the development and application of tungsten carbides, ceramics, super-hard materials and solutions used in metal cutting and extreme wear applications to keep customers up and running longer against conditions such as corrosion and high temperatures. Our standard and custom product offerings span metal cutting and wear applications including turning, milling, hole making, tooling systems and services, as well as specialized wear components and metallurgical powders. End users of our metal cutting products include manufacturers engaged in a diverse array of industries including: the manufacturers of transportation vehicles and components, machine tools and light and heavy machinery; airframe and aerospace components; and energy-related components for the oil and gas industry, as well as power generation. Our wear and metallurgical powders are used by producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as road construction, mining, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply. Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, constant currency regional sales growth (decline) and constant currency end market sales growth (decline). We provide the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the MD&A section as well as details on the use and derivation of these financial measures. Our sales of $497.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 increased 2 percent year-over-year, reflecting 11 percent organic sales growth, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 8 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent.
Operating income was $35.5 million compared to $47.5 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease of $12.0 million was primarily due to higher raw material costs of approximately $23 million, higher wages and general inflation, including an inflationary bonus of $2 million for certain German employees, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $6 million, and in the Infrastructure segment, under-absorption of approximately $5 million mainly due to reduced powder production to actively manage the drawdown of safety stock. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization and higher sales volumes. Operating margin was 7.1 percent compared to 9.8 percent in the prior year quarter. The Metal Cutting and Infrastructure segments had operating margins of 8.8 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic bringing significant uncertainty in our end markets and operations. Since then, many jurisdictions have eased or eliminated stay-at-home, social distancing, and various other restrictions implemented at the onset of the pandemic, as the administration and acceptance of vaccines has increased and COVID-19 cases have dropped. One of the last countries to ease pandemic-control measures was China, which in December 2022 announced it would be rolling back some of its most strict anti-COVID-19 restrictions, including lockdowns, mask mandates and travel restrictions. Nevertheless, the restrictions in China, temporary labor shortages due to COVID-19 related absenteeism in certain regions and other supply chain challenges created significant operating constraints on our business during the course of the pandemic.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia by the United States, Canada, the European Union and other countries. We have experienced increased costs for energy and raw materials and
other supply chain issues due, in part, to the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy. During the March quarter of 2022, the Company ceased operations in Russia and subsequently decided to liquidate its legal entity in Russia, which is expected to be completed during fiscal 2023.
In addition, our business has been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange and inflationary headwinds. We have been able to partially mitigate the effects of inflation, foreign currency exchange challenges and other disruptions through price increases on our products. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of these issues on our business, operating results or financial condition, but we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions and attempt to mitigate the negative effect to the extent possible.
21 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased $11 million and $30 million, respectively, of Kennametal common stock under its $200 million three-year program. Inception-to-date the Company has repurchased $115 million of Kennametal common stock. The Company paid $16 million and $32 million in cash dividends to Kennametal shareholders during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company has a long history of consistently paying dividends to shareholders since its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1967.
Current quarter earnings per diluted share (EPS) was $0.27. EPS of $0.37 in the prior year quarter was favorably affected by the net benefit from the reversal of restructuring and related charges of $0.02 per share and the gain on the New Castle divestiture of $0.01 per share, partially offset by differences in annual projected tax rates of $0.01 per share. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $52.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $57.8 million during the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $50.6 million and $37.7 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS SALES Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $497.1 million, an increase of $10.4 million, or 2 percent, from $486.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in sales was driven by organic growth of 11 percent, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 8 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $991.9 million, an increase of $21.7 million, or 2 percent, from $970.2 million in the prior year period. The increase in sales was driven by organic growth of 10 percent, partially offset by an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 7 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Our sales growth (decline) by end market and region are as follows:

The decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs of approximately $23 million, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $12 million, higher wages and general inflation, including an inflationary bonus of $2 million for certain German employees, under-absorption of approximately $5 million mainly due to reduced powder production to actively manage the drawdown of safety stock, and depreciation of approximately $2 million due to the decision to scrap certain assets. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization and higher sales volumes. Gross profit margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 28.7 percent, as compared to 31.4 percent in the prior year quarter.
22 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $302.9 million, a decrease of $10.8 million from $313.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs of approximately $41 million, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $24 million, higher wages and general inflation, including an inflationary bonus of $2 million for certain German employees, temporary supply chain disruptions of approximately $5 million, under-absorption of approximately $5 million mainly due to reduced powder production to actively manage the drawdown of safety stock, and depreciation of approximately $2 million due to the decision to scrap certain assets. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization and higher sales volumes. Gross profit margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 30.5 percent, as compared to 32.3 percent in the prior year period. OPERATING EXPENSE Operating expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $105.8 million compared to $106.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $214.0 million compared to $209.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled $10.7 million and $10.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $21.3 million and $20.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased to $7.0 million compared to $6.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased to $13.7 million compared to $12.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The changes for both periods were primarily related to the increased amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. OTHER EXPENSE/INCOME, NET Other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.6 million compared to other income of $3.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Other expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.6 million compared to other income of $6.6 million during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The changes for both periods were due primarily to lower net periodic pension income in the current year. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 17.8 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a $2.2 million tax benefit recorded in the current year quarter related to Swiss tax reform and geographical mix. The effective income tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 23.6 percent and 26.5 percent, respectively. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a $2.2 million tax benefit recorded in the current year period related to Swiss tax reform and geographical mix. BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW We operate in two reportable segments consisting of Metal Cutting and Infrastructure. Our reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for allocating resources, making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. We do not allocate certain corporate expenses related to executive retirement plans, our Board of Directors, strategic initiatives, and certain other costs and report them in Corporate. Our reportable operating segments do not represent the aggregation of two or more operating segments. 23 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Our sales and operating income by segment are as follows:

This was driven by organic growth of 11 percent, offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 10 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Aerospace end market sales increased in all regions as global travel levels and airplane manufacturing continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, despite ongoing supply chain issues affecting certain components. Energy sales, excluding the effect from foreign currency, increased in Asia Pacific as economic activity increased, partially offset by decreases in the Americas and EMEA driven by timing of customer investments. Sales in our general engineering end market increased, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in the Americas and EMEA as manufacturing activity continues to recover from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and strong underlying demand continues, though inflation and supply chain challenges mitigated growth. In Asia Pacific, sales in our general engineering end market decreased due to ongoing COVID-19 challenges. Transportation end market sales increased in all regions due to improved automotive manufacturing levels and continued strong underlying demand. On a regional basis, the sales increase in the Americas and EMEA, excluding the effect from foreign currency exchange, were driven by increases in the aerospace, transportation, and general engineering end markets, partially offset by a decrease in the energy end market. The sales increase in Asia Pacific, excluding the effect from foreign currency exchange, was driven by increases in the aerospace, energy and transportation end markets, partially offset by a decrease in the general engineering end market. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Metal Cutting operating income was $26.2 million compared to $27.9 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher wages and general inflation, including an inflationary bonus of $2 million for certain German employees, higher raw material costs of approximately $8 million, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $6 million and depreciation of approximately $2 million due to the decision to scrap certain assets. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization, higher sales volumes and a gain of approximately $2 million on a property sale. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Metal Cutting sales were flat compared to the prior year period. This was driven by organic growth of 10 percent, offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 9 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Aerospace end market sales increased in all regions as global travel levels and airplane manufacturing continue to recover from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite ongoing supply chain issues affecting certain components. Energy sales increased, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in the Americas and Asia Pacific as economic activity increased and countries began developing alternative supply chains in response to the sanctions on Russia, partially offset by a decrease in EMEA. Sales in our general engineering end market increased, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in all regions as manufacturing activity continues to recover from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and strong underlying demand continues, though inflation and supply chain challenges mitigated growth. Transportation end market sales increased, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in all regions due to improved automotive manufacturing levels and continued strong underlying demand. On a regional basis, the sales increase in the Americas and Asia Pacific, excluding the effect from foreign currency exchange, were driven by increases in all end markets. The sales increase in EMEA, excluding the effect from foreign currency exchange, was driven by increases in the aerospace, general engineering and transportation end markets, partially offset by a decrease in the energy end market. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Metal Cutting operating income was $54.8 million compared to $57.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher wages and general inflation, including an inflationary bonus of $2 million for certain German employees, higher raw material costs of approximately $12 million, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $10 million and depreciation including approximately $2 million due to the decision to scrap certain assets. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization, higher sales volumes and a gain of approximately $2 million on a property sale.

The increase in sales was driven by organic growth of 12 percent, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 6 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Energy end market sales increased as U.S. oil and gas contributed to the year-over-year increase and as land rig counts continue to increase. Earthworks end market sales increased primarily due to growth in mining. In general engineering, the increase in sales was across all regions, excluding the effect from foreign currency exchange. On a regional basis, the sales increases in the Americas and EMEA, excluding the effect of foreign currency, was driven by increases in all end markets. The sales increase in Asia Pacific, excluding the effect of foreign currency, was driven by increases in the earthworks and general engineering end markets, partially offset by a decline in the energy end market.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Infrastructure operating income was $10.1 million compared to $20.0 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher raw material costs of approximately $16 million, under-absorption of approximately $5 million mainly due to reduced powder production to actively manage the drawdown of safety stock, higher wages and general inflation, and price realization ahead of raw material cost increases in the prior year quarter that did not repeat. These factors were partially offset by modest sales volume growth. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Infrastructure sales increased by 5 percent from the prior year period. The increase in sales was driven by organic growth of 11 percent, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect of 5 percent and an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Energy end market sales increased as U.S. oil and gas contributed to the year-over-year increase and as land rig counts continue to increase. Earthworks end market sales increased primarily due to growth in mining and to a lesser extent construction. In general engineering, excluding the effect of foreign currency, the increase in sales was driven by growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the Americas. On a regional basis, the sales increases in the Americas was driven by increases in the earthworks and energy end markets, partially offset by a decline in the general engineering end market. The sales increase in EMEA, excluding the effect of foreign currency, was driven by increases in all end markets. The sales increase in Asia Pacific, excluding the effect of foreign currency, was driven by increases in the earthworks and general engineering end markets, partially offset by a decline in the energy end market. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Infrastructure operating income was $30.9 million compared to $46.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher raw material costs of approximately $28 million, higher wages and general inflation, under-absorption of approximately $5 million mainly due to reduced powder production to actively manage the drawdown of safety stock, temporary supply chain disruptions and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $3 million. These factors were partially offset by higher price realization and sales volume growth. 26 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) CORPORATE Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Corporate expense $ (828) $ (361) $ (1,696) $ (955) For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Corporate expense increased by $0.5 million from the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 Corporate expense decreased by $0.7 million from the prior year period. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flow from operations is the primary source of funding for our capital expenditures. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash flow provided by operating activities was $52.5 million. During fiscal 2022, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement is a five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, which we use to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans of up to $700.0 million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be (1) Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) for any borrowings in euros, pounds sterling, yen, U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, respectively, plus an applicable margin, (2) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus an applicable margin, or (3) fixed as negotiated by us. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2027. The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including one financial covenant: a maximum leverage ratio where debt, net of domestic cash in excess of $25 million and sixty percent of the unrestricted cash held outside of the United States, must be less than or equal to 3.75 times trailing twelve months EBITDA, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement and we had $76.8 million of borrowings outstanding and $623.2 million of additional availability. We had $19.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2022. We consider the majority of the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. With regard to these unremitted earnings, we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. With regard to the small portion of unremitted earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested, we maintain a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes. In 2012, we received an assessment from the Italian tax authority that denied certain tax deductions primarily related to our 2008 tax return. Attempts at negotiating a reasonable settlement with the tax authority were unsuccessful; and as a result, we decided to litigate the matter. While the outcome of the litigation is still pending, the tax authority served notice in the September quarter of fiscal 2020 requiring payment in the amount of €36 million. Accordingly, we requested and were granted a stay and are not currently required to make a payment in connection with this assessment. We continue to believe that the assessment is baseless and accordingly, no income tax liability has been recorded in connection with this assessment in any period. However, if the Italian tax authority were to be successful in litigation, settlement of the amount alleged by the Italian tax authority would result in an increase to income tax expense by as much as €36.8 million, or $39.3 million, including penalties and interest of €22.1 million, or $23.6 million. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $76.8 million, Total Kennametal Shareholders' equity was $1,250.2 million and total debt was $673.6 million. Our current senior credit ratings are at investment grade levels. We believe that our current financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide us access to the capital markets. We believe that we have sufficient resources available to meet cash requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to closely monitor our liquidity position and the condition of the capital markets, as well as the counterparty risk of our credit providers. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments since June 30, 2022.
27 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities During the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash flow provided by operating activities was $52.5 million, compared to $57.8 million for the prior year period. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the current year period consisted of net income and non-cash items amounting to an inflow of $131.3 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of $78.8 million. Contributing to the changes in certain assets and liabilities were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $52.8 million, an increase in inventories of $32.9 million, and a decrease in accrued pension and postretirement benefits of $4.5 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.0 million. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, cash flow provided by operating activities consisted of net income and non-cash items amounting to an inflow of $144.5 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of $86.7 million. Contributing to the changes in certain assets and liabilities were an increase in inventories of $67.0 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $36.6 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was a decrease in accounts receivable of $23.0 million. Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities Cash flow used in investing activities was $48.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $36.1 million for the prior year period. During the current year period, cash flow used in investing activities primarily included capital expenditures, net of $48.2 million, which consisted primarily of equipment upgrades, partially offset by disposals of property, plant, and equipment of $2.5 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, cash flow used for investing activities included capital expenditures, net of $37.1 million, which consisted primarily of expenditures related to our simplification/modernization initiatives and equipment upgrades, partially offset by the $1.0 million in proceeds from the New Castle divestiture. Cash Flow Used in Financing Activities Cash flow used in financing activities was $11.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $72.5 million in the prior year period. During the current year period, cash flow used in financing activities included $57.8 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, more than offset by $30.1 million in common shares repurchased, $32.4 million of cash dividends paid to Kennametal Shareholders and $5.8 million of the effect of employee benefit and stock plans and dividend reinvestment. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, cash flow used for financing activities included $35.5 million in common shares repurchased, $33.5 million of cash dividends paid to Kennametal Shareholders, $6.8 million of the effect of employee benefit and stock plans and dividend reinvestment, and a $5.1 million decrease in notes payable, partially offset by $9 million from the borrowings under the Credit Agreement. FINANCIAL CONDITION Working capital was $554.0 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $14.9 million from $539.1 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in inventories of $34.9 million, a decrease in other current liabilities of $24.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $21.2 million and a decrease in accrued expenses of $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $57.6 million, an increase in accrued income taxes of $11.5 million and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $8.8 million. Currency exchange rate effects increased working capital by a total of approximately $0.4 million, the effect of which is included in the aforementioned changes. Property, plant and equipment, net decreased $20.5 million from $1,002.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $981.6 million at December 31, 2022, primarily due to depreciation expense of $60.9 million, partially offset by net capital additions of $48.2 million and foreign currency effects of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2022, other assets were $548.7 million, an increase of $2.0 million from $546.8 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in deferred income taxes of $2.5 million, an increase in goodwill of $2.4 million due to currency exchange effects, partially offset by amortization of intangibles of $6.3 million. Kennametal Shareholders' equity was $1,250.2 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $2.4 million from $1,252.6 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to cash dividends paid to Kennametal Shareholders of $32.4 million and the repurchase of capital stock of $30.1 million primarily under the share repurchase program that was initiated during fiscal 2022, partially offset by net income attributable to Kennametal of $50.1 million.
28 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since June 30, 2022. RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with SEC rules, below are the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures we use in this report and the reconciliation of these measures to the most closely related GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-over-year results. The non-GAAP financial measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. We believe these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP financial measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth
Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, business days and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Also, we report organic sales growth at the consolidated and segment levels. Constant currency end market sales growth
Constant currency end market sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by end market excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth, constant currency end market sales growth does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying end market trends by providing end market sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. Also, we report constant currency end market sales growth at the consolidated and segment levels.
Constant currency regional sales growth
Constant currency regional sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by region excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth, constant currency regional sales growth does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying regional trends by providing regional sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. Also, we report constant currency regional sales growth at the consolidated and segment levels. Reconciliations of organic sales growth to sales growth are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Metal Cutting Infrastructure Total Organic sales growth 11% 12% 11% Foreign currency exchange effect (1) (10) (6) (8) Business days effect (2) (1) (1) (1) Sales growth —% 5% 2% Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Metal Cutting Infrastructure Total Organic sales growth 10% 11% 10% Foreign currency exchange effect (1) (9) (5) (7) Business days effect (2) (1) (1) (1) Sales growth —% 5% 2% 29 Table of Contents Item 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Reconciliations of constant currency end market sales growth to end market sales growth (decline) (2)

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management evaluated, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). The Company's disclosure controls were designed to provide a reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, the controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the controls' stated goals. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance at December 31, 2022 that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 32 Table of Contents PART II.
