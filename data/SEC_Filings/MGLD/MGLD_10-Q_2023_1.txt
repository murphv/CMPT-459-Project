SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “shall,” “might,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about:
•
the outcome of the class action litigation;
•
recent resolutions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) against United States Oil Fund, L.P., United States Commodity Funds, LLC, a subsidiary of our subsidiary, USCF Investments, Inc.

We caution you that the foregoing list does not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or our registration statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we and our subsidiaries operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We and our subsidiaries may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.

The Marygold Companies, through Gourmet Foods and its wholly owned subsidiary, Printstock Products Limited, has
two
major customer groups comprising gross revenues:
1 ) baking, and
2 ) printing. For the purpose of segment reporting (Note
16 ), both revenue streams are considered part of the same "food industry" segment as they are evaluated as
one
segment by the Company's chief operating decision maker.
Baking:
Within the baking sector there are
three
major customer groups;
1 ) grocery,
2 ) gasoline convenience stores, and
3 ) independent retailers. The grocery industry is dominated by several large chain operations, which are customers of Gourmet Foods, and there are
no
long-term guarantees that these major customers will continue to purchase products from Gourmet Foods, however, many of the existing relationships have been in place for sufficient time to give management reasonable confidence in their continuing business. For the
three
month period ended
December 31, 2022,
Gourmet Foods’ largest customer in the grocery industry, who operates through a number of independently branded stores, accounted for approximately
13 % of baking sales revenues as compared to
20 % for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2021.
For the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
the largest customer accounted for approximately
15 % of baking sales revenues as compared to
23 % for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2021.
This customer did
not
account for a significant percentage of baking accounts receivable at
December 31, 2022,
but was responsible for
25 % of baking accounts receivable as of
June 30, 2022.
A different customer accounted for approximately
10 % of baking accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
as compared to
26 % as of
June 30, 2022.
In the gasoline convenience store market customer group, Gourmet Foods supplies
two
major channels. The largest is a marketing consortium of gasoline dealers operating under the same brand who, for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022
accounted for approximately
56 % and
55 %, respectively, of baking sales revenues as compared to
52 % and
49 % for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively.
No
single member of the consortium is responsible for a significant portion of Gourmet Foods’ accounts receivable, however as a group they accounted for
46 % of baking accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
as compared to
21 % as of
June 30, 2022.  A
second
consortium of gasoline convenience stores accounted for
10 % and
7 % of baking sales revenues for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
respectively. The group also accounted for
28 % and
23 % of baking accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022,
respectively.
The
third
major customer group is independent retailers and cafes, which collectively accounted for the balance of baking sales revenue, however
no
single customer in this group was a significant contributor of baking sales revenues for the
three
month and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022
or
December 31, 2021,
nor a significant contributor to baking accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022.
Printing:
The printing sector of Gourmet Foods' gross revenues is comprised of many customers, some large and some small, with
one
customer accounting for
52 % and
50 % of the printing sector revenues for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
respectively, as compared to
36 % and
38 % for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively. This same customer accounted for
40 % of the printing sector accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022,
respectively.
Consolidated:
With respect to Gourmet Foods’ consolidated risk, the largest
three
customers accounted for
35 %,
21 % and
8 % of Gourmet Foods' consolidated gross revenues for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
compared to
32 %,
15 % and
12 % for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2021.
For the
six
month period ended
December 31, 2022,
these
three
customers accounted for
35 %,
21 % and
9 % of consolidated gross revenues as compared to
32 %,
15 % and
15 % for the
six
month period ended
December 31, 2021.
These customers accounted for
18 %,
25 % and
nil%  of the consolidated accounts receivable of Gourmet Foods as of
December 31, 2022
as compared to
7 %,
26 % and
8 %, respectively, as of
June 30, 2022.
Gourmet Foods, including Printstock, is
not
dependent upon any
one
major supplier as many alternative sources are available in the local marketplace should the need arise. However, the unavailability of, or increase in price in, any of the ingredients on which Gourmet Foods relies to produce its products could harm its operating results for such period.

The Marygold Companies, through Brigadier, is partially dependent upon its contractual relationship with the alarm monitoring company who provides monitoring services to Brigadier’s customers. In the event this contract is terminated, Brigadier would be compelled to find an alternate source of alarm monitoring, or establish such a facility itself. Management believes that the contractual relationship is sustainable, and has been for many years, with alternate solutions available should the need arise. Sales to the largest customer, which includes contracts and recurring monthly support fees, totaled
42 % and
47 % of the total Brigadier revenues for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022,
respectively, as compared to
49 % and
51 % for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively. The same customer accounted for approximately
23 % of Brigadier's accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
as compared to
31 % as of
June 30, 2022.
Brigadier purchases alarm panels, digital and analog cameras, mounting hardware and accessory items needed to complete security installations from a variety of sources. The manufacture of electronic items such as those sought by Brigadier has expanded to a global scale thus providing Brigadier with a broad choice of suppliers. Brigadier bases its vendor selection on several criteria including: price, availability, shipping costs, quality, suitability for purpose and the technical support of the manufacturer. Brigadier is
not
reliant on any
one
supplier.
The Marygold Companies, through Original Sprout, sells its products through
3
channels to market:
1 ) direct sales to end users via online shopping carts,
2 ) sales through international wholesale distributors who, in turn, sell to other retailers or wholesalers, and
3 ) to retail stores selling to end users either from the shelf or online.
Original Sprout, has thousands of customers and, from time to time, certain customers become significant during specific reporting periods, but
may
not
be significant during other periods. Original Sprout had
one
significant customer for the
three
month period ended
December 31, 2022
who accounted for
10 % of gross revenues.
No
other customers accounted for a significant percentage of sales revenues for the
three
or
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021.
Six different customers,
none
of whom contributed significant sales levels, accounted for
30 %,
15 %,
15 %,
15 %,
10 % and
9 % of total accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2022
as compared to
12 %,

11%,
13 %,
15 % and
16 % for the same
six
customers, respectively, as of
June 30, 2022.
The Marygold Companies, through Original Sprout, is dependent upon its relationship with a product packaging company who, at the direction of Original Sprout, produces the products in accordance with proprietary formulas, packages them in appropriate containers, and delivers the finished goods to Original Sprout for distribution to its customers. All of Original Sprout’s products are currently produced by this packaging company, although if this relationship were to fail there are other similar packaging companies available to Original Sprout at competitive pricing. Because of the nature of the Original Sprout product ingredients, some of the ingredients
may,
at times, be difficult to source in timely fashion or at the expected price point. To safeguard against this possibility, Original Sprout endeavors to maintain at least a
90 -day supply of all products in stock. Estimating and maintaining a reserve stock account is
not
a guarantee that a shortage of ingredient supplies will
not
affect production such that Original Sprout will
not
exhaust its reserves or be unable to fulfill customer orders.
The Marygold Companies, through Marygold & Co. (UK), had  no
significant customer or vendor concentrations as of or for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting primarily of: (i) food products, printing supplies, and packaging in New Zealand; (ii) hair and skin care finished products and components in the U.S.; and, (iii) security system hardware in Canada, are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories in Canada and New Zealand are maintained on the
first -in,
first -out method, while inventory in the U.S. is maintained using the average cost method. Inventories include product cost, inbound freight and warehousing costs where applicable. Management compares the cost of inventories with the net realizable value and an allowance is made for writing down the inventories to their net realizable value, if lower. An assessment is made at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine what slow-moving inventory items, if any, should be deemed obsolete and written down to their estimated net realizable value. For the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
the expense for slow-moving or obsolete inventory was $ 288  and $ 3,478 , respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and leasehold improvements are capitalized. Office furniture and equipment include office fixtures, computers, printers and other office equipment plus software and applicable packaging designs. Leasehold improvements, which are included in plant and equipment, are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement and the length of the lease. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset (see Note
5
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of brand names, domain names, recipes, non-compete agreements and customer lists along with the internal use software in process for the business applications of Marygold to be launched in the coming fiscal year. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may
not
be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the discounted expected future cash flows. If the future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. There was
no
impairment recorded for the
six
month period ended
December 31, 2022
or the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination transaction. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the
fourth
quarter of the Company's fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill
may
be impaired. The Company
first
performs a qualitative test to determine if goodwill is impaired at a reporting unit. In performing this test, the Company evaluates macroeconomic factors, industry and market considerations, cost factors such as the increase in the cost of materials or labor or other costs, overall financial performance, changes in key personnel or customers or strategy, and other entity-specific events or trends that could indicate impairment, among other items. If the results of this test indicate that it is more likely than
not
that the fair value of the reporting is below its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed to determine the amount of the impairment. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. There was
no
impairment recorded for the
six  month period ended
December 31, 2022
or the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may
not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. There was
no
impairment recorded for the
six
month period ended
December 31, 2022
or the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022.
Investments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Equity securities included in short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and debt securities are classified as trading securities. The Company measures the investments at fair value at period end with any changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or (losses) which is included as part of other (expense) income. The Company values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
820
– Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC
820” ). ASC
820
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC
820
relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement. ASC
820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: ( 1 ) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (observable inputs) and ( 2 ) The Company’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The
three
levels defined by the ASC
820
hierarchy are as follows:
Level
1
– Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level
2
– Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level
1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level
2
assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not
active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
Level
3
– Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are
not
available.
In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
The Company from time to time will issue warrant instruments to purchase common stock and accounts for warrant instruments as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the warrants and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC
480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ("ASC
480" ) and ASC
815,
Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC
815" ). Generally, warrants issued in connection with debt and equity financings are presented as a component of equity unless the warrants include a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares among other conditions, or it is possible that the Company
may
need to settle the warrants in cash, in which instance the warrants would be accounted for as non-current liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. As of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022
all outstanding warrants are classified as equity instruments.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the grant date closing stock price for restricted stock awards. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of
four
to
five
years. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation consists entirely of vesting related to restricted stock awards and stock options for the
three
and
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022,
and as such awards were granted during the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022. ( see Note
12 - Stock-based Awards - Employees and Vendor Compensation)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue consists of fees earned through management of investment funds in the United States, fees earned in through the management of customer investments in the United Kingdom, sale of gourmet meat pies and printing of food wrappers in New Zealand, security alarm system installation and maintenance services in Canada, and sales of hair and skin care products internationally. Revenue is accounted for net of sales taxes, sales returns, and trade discounts. The performance obligation is satisfied when the product has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales or services, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped, the subscription period commences, or the management fees earned each month. For our Brigadier subsidiary in Canada, the Company operates under contract with an alarm monitoring company that pays a percentage of its recurring monitoring fee to Brigadier in exchange for continued customer service and support functions with respect to each customer maintained under contract by the monitoring company. The Company has
no
costs of contracts which require capitalization.
The Company generates revenue, in part, through contractual monthly recurring fees received for providing ongoing customer support services to monitoring company clientele. The
five -step process governing contract revenue reporting includes:
1.
Identifying the contract(s) with customers;
2.
Identifying the performance obligations in the contract;
3.
Determining the transaction price;
4.
Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
Recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Transactions involve security systems that are sold outright to the customer where the Company's performance obligations include customer support services and the sale and installation of the security systems. For such arrangements, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative stand-alone selling price. Revenue associated with the sale and installation of security systems is recognized once installation is complete, and is reflected as security system revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue associated with customer support services is recognized as those services are provided, and is included as a component of security system revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, which for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
were approximately $ 86,786
and $ 169,854 , or approximately
13 % of the total security system revenues as compared to $ 219,904
and $ 407,629
for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively, or
34 % and
30 % of the total security system revenues. These revenues for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
account for approximately
1 % and
2 %, respectively, of total consolidated revenues as compared to
2 % and
2 % for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively.
None
of the other subsidiaries of the Company generate revenues from long-term contracts.
Because the Company has
no
contract with the end user, and the monthly payments for customer support services are made to the Company by the monitoring company who has a contract with the end user, and end user customers are subject to cancellation through
no
control of the Company,
no
deferred revenues or contingent liability reserves have been established with respect to these contracts. The services are deemed delivered as the obligation is acknowledged on a monthly basis.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not
that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits or if future deductibility is uncertain.
15
Table of Contents
When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than
not
that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are
not
offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than- not
recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than
50
percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Applicable interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statements of income.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Marketing and advertising costs for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021
were $ 0.6  million and $ 0.7
million, respectively. Marketing and advertising costs for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021
were $ 1.3
million and $ 1.4  million, respectively.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Foreign Currency Translation
We record foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses in accordance with ASC
830,
Foreign Currency Matters . The accounts of Gourmet Foods use the New Zealand dollar as the functional currency. The accounts of Brigadier Security System use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency, and the accounts of Marygold UK use the Great Britain pound as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and operating results are translated at the weighted average exchange rate throughout the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) can also occur if a transaction is settled in a currency other than the entity's functional currency. Accumulated currency translation gains and (losses) are classified as an item of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.
Segment Reporting
The Company defines operating segments as components for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performances. The Company allocates its resources and assesses the performance of its sales activities based on these segments (Refer to Note
16
of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are
not
limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results
may
differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is
one
year from the acquisition date, we
may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and year ended
June 30, 2022
a determination was made that
no
adjustments were necessary.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”)
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic
326 ):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU
2018 - 19,
ASU
2019 - 04,
ASU
2019 - 05,
ASU
2019 - 10,
and ASU
2019 - 11,
which replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and require a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2022 ( as amended by ASU
2019 - 10 ), including interim periods within that annual period. The Company anticipates the adoption of the standard will lead to changes in disclosures as well as insignificant changes related to the period of recognition of losses on its receivables.
In
August 2020,
the FASB issued ASU  No.
2020 - 06,
Debt
–
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470 - 20 ) and Derivatives and Hedging
–
Contracts in Entity ’ s Own Equity (Subtopic
815 - 40 ).
The amendment is meant to simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in subtopic
470 - 20
for convertible instruments. The amendment also changed the method used to calculate diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for convertible instruments and for instruments that
may
be settled in cash. The amendment is effective for years beginning after
December 15, 2023,
including interim periods for those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after
December 15, 2020,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company anticipates the adoption of the standard will
not
have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures given its current and anticipated operations.

BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. This calculation includes the weighted average number of Series B Convertible Preferred shares outstanding also, as they are deemed to be substantially similar to the common shares and shareholders are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. Potentially dilutive securities include the Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, and outstanding warrants to purchase common stock. The treasury stock method is used to compute the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding warrants, stock options, and unvested restricted stock. Under this method, options, warrants, and unvested restricted stock are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
On
August 25, 2021
the Company adopted the
2021
Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and had  not
issued any awards under the Plan as of
June 30, 2022.
During the
six
months ending
December 31, 2022
the Company issued
277,037
restricted stock awards and
50,000
stock options to employees. The Company has also authorized a reverse stock split of its Common Stock by a ratio of
not
less than
1 -for- 1.5
and
not
more than
1 -for- 2.75
(the “Reverse Stock Split”) at any time prior to the
one
year anniversary of filing of a definitive Information Statement on Schedule
14C
with the Board of Directors (the "Board") having the discretion as to whether or
not
the Reverse Stock Split is to be effected, and with the exact ratio of any Reverse Stock Split to be set within the above range as determined by the Board in its discretion.
Basic and diluted net income per share reflects the effects of shares potentially issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock. The dilutive effect of nonvested restricted stock awards and stock options results in approximately
0
and
13,063  incremental shares to be included in the diluted shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
respectively. For the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
the Company excluded
327,037
and
0
common stock equivalents, respectively, because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

1,650,000
shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.001

Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the public offering price was $ 2.00
per Share (the "Offering Price"), and the Underwriter purchased the Shares at a
7.0 % discount to the public Offering Price. The Company granted the Underwriter the option to purchase, within
45
days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, an additional
247,500
shares of Common Stock at the same price per share as the Shares (the “Over-Allotment Option”), which the Underwriter exercised in full on

Maxim Group LLC acted as sole book-running manager for the Offering.
The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriter, including liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933,
as amended, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and related “lock-up” agreements, the Company, each director and executive officer of the Company and certain significant stockholders of the Company have agreed
not
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of securities of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, for a
180 -day period, subject to certain limitations therein.
In exchange for the Underwriter’s services, the Company agreed to (i) sell the Common Stock to the Underwriter at a purchase price of $ 1.86
per share of Common Stock, reflecting the underwriting discount of
7 %, and (ii) issue the Underwriter (or its designees) the Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock equal to
5.0 % of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock sold in the Offering, along with associated registration rights (the “Underwriter’s Warrants”).
On
March 14, 2022,
the Offering closed resulting in the Company selling a total of
1,897,500
shares of common stock, including
247,500

and $ 545,090 , respectively. There has been
no
material change in the planned use of proceeds as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on

pursuant to Rule
424 (b)( 4 ).

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On
August 17, 2021,
our wholly-owned subsidiary Marygold UK entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of Tiger Financial and Asset Management Limited (“Tiger”), a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales and located in Northampton, England. Tiger is an asset manager and investment advisor operating pursuant to certification by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom with approximately
£42
million in assets under management as of
June 20, 2022.
The transaction closed on
June 20, 2022
with an agreed purchase price of  £2,382,372
(translated to
US$2,913,164
as of the closing date
June 20, 2022),
subject to adjustment as provided for in the SPA. As of
December 31, 2022,  £1,882,372
had been paid with  £500,000
(approximately
US$604,990
translated as of
December 31, 2022)  remaining due and payable on
December 31, 2023,  subject to downward adjustment per the terms of the SPA for an amount up to
£500,000
should existing clientele close their accounts prior to
December 31, 2023.
There is
no
provision for any upward adjustments. As a result, management was able to complete its preliminary purchase price allocation as follows, under the assumption
no
downward adjustment will take place on
December 31, 2023.
Included in the allocation are estimated income tax liabilities of approximately
US$86,277
pertaining to the operations prior to acquisition, and
US$113,833  of deferred income tax liabilities associated with the value of the acquired intangible assets. The amounts have been translated to US currency as of the acquisition date. Tiger will be operated as a subsidiary of Marygold UK and is expected to be initially cash flow neutral. In addition to growing the business through increasing assets under management, Marygold UK intends to project the fintech mobile app services to be offered by Marygold in the U.S. into the U.K. through the established contacts and certifications held by Tiger.

INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts, and for net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not
that such asset will
not
be realized. The Company continues to monitor the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. If recovery is
not
likely, the Company must increase its provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance on income taxes under which the Company
may
only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a "more likely than
not"
threshold. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.
As of
December 31, 2022,
the Company's total unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $ 0.3
million, which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company will recognize interest and penalties, when they occur, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of tax expense. There is
no
interest or penalties to be recognized for the
three  months ended
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021.
The Company is required to make its best estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis. The Company recorded tax expense of $ 107  thousand and $ 334
thousand for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
respectively, as compared to tax expense of ($ 84 ) thousand and ($ 323 ) thousand for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively.. The effective tax rate could fluctuate in the future due to changes in the taxable income mix between various jurisdictions.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal, various states, Canada and New Zealand tax jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. The Company’s U.S. tax years
2018  through
2021  will remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities which is
three
and
four
years, respectively. The Company’s tax years from
2018  through
2021  remain open for examination by Canada and New Zealand authorities. As of
December 31, 2022,
there were
no
active taxing authority examinations.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease Commitments
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, accrued expenses, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms
may
include options to extend or
not
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. For the majority of its leases, the Company concluded that it is
not
reasonably certain that any renewal options would be exercised, and, therefore, the amounts are
not
recognized as part of operating lease right-of-use assets nor operating lease liabilities. Leases with an initial term of
12
months or less, and certain office equipment leases which are deemed insignificant, are
not
recorded on the balance sheet and expensed as incurred and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
The Company’s most significant operating leases are real estate leases of office, warehouse and production facilities. The remaining operating leases are primarily comprised of leases of printers and other equipment which are deemed insignificant. For all operating leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient permitted under Topic
842
to combine lease and non-lease components. As a result, non-lease components, such as common area or equipment maintenance charges, are accounted for as a single lease element.
The Company has
one
finance lease wherein ownership of the underlying asset will be transferred to the Company at the end of the lease term. The underlying asset of the finance lease is a solar energy system at our Gourmet Foods subsidiary in New Zealand that is included with property, plant and equipment on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Fixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Certain of the Company’s operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the landlord, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance. Variable payments are deemed immaterial, expensed as incurred, and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense.
The Company leases various facilities and offices throughout the world including the following subsidiary locations:
Gourmet Foods has operating leases for its office, factory and warehouse facilities located in Tauranga, New Zealand, and facilities leased by its subsidiary, Printstock, in Napier, New Zealand, as well as for certain equipment including printers and copiers. These leases are generally for
three -year terms, with some options to renew for an additional term. The company opted to renew
two
leases during the
three
month period ended
December 31, 2022
and recognized an increase in right of use asset and corresponding operating lease liability of
US$ 103,603
translated as of
December 31, 2022.
The leases mature between
October 2025  and
October 2026,
and require monthly rental payments of approximately $ 24,189
(GST
not
included) translated to U.S. currency as of
December 31, 2022.
Additionally, Gourmet Foods has
one
finance lease for its solar energy system that ends in
December 2031
at the monthly rate of approximately
US$1,665
translated as of
December 31, 2022.
Brigadier leases office and storage facilities in Regina, Saskatchewan. The minimum lease obligations for the Regina facility require monthly payments of approximately
US$2,435
translated to U.S. currency as of
December 31, 2022.
Original Sprout currently leases office and warehouse space in San Clemente, CA with
3 -year facility lease expiring on
November 30, 2023.
Minimum monthly lease payments of approximately $ 23,625
commenced
December 1, 2022.
USCF Investments leases office space in Walnut Creek, California under an operating lease which expires in
December 2024.
Minimum monthly lease payments are approximately $ 13,063  with increases annually.
For
three
months ended
December 31, 2022  and
2021,
the combined lease payments of the Company and its subsidiaries totaled $ 204,459
and $ 209,172 , respectively. For the
six
month periods ended
December 31, 2022  and
2021,
the combined lease payments of the Company and its subsidiaries totaled $ 402,951
and $ 411,261 , respectively. Lease payments are recorded under general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of
December 31, 2022
the Consolidated Balance Sheets included operating lease right-of-use assets totaling $ 1,216,302 , recorded net of $ 35,372
in deferred rent, and $ 1,251,674
in total operating lease liabilities.

Additionally, Gourmet Foods entered into a General Security Agreement in favor of the Gerald O’Leary Family Trust and registered on the Personal Property Securities Register for a priority sum of
NZ$110,000
(approximately
US$69,850 ) to secure the lease of its primary facility. In addition, a
NZ$20,000
(approximately
US$12,700 ) bond has been posted through ANZ Bank and secured with a cash deposit of equal amount to secure a separate facilities lease. The General Security Agreement and the cash deposit will remain until such time as the respective leases are satisfactorily terminated in accordance with their terms. Interest from the cash deposit securing the lease accumulates to the benefit of Gourmet Foods and is listed as a component of interest income/expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Other Agreements and Commitments
USCF manages
four
Funds (BNO, CPER, UGA, UNL) which had expense waiver provisions during the prior fiscal year, whereby USCF reimburses funds when fund expenditure levels exceed certain threshold amounts. Effective
May 1, 2021
USCF discontinued expense waiver reimbursements for BNO, CPER and UGA with only UNL continuing. As of
December 31, 2022  and
June 30, 2022
the expense waiver payable was $ 164
thousand and $ 70
thousand, respectively. USCF has
no
obligation to continue such payments for UNL into subsequent periods.
As Marygold builds out its application it enters into agreements with various service providers. As of
December 31, 2022,
Marygold has future payment commitments with its primary service vendors totaling $ 1.5
million including approximately $ 0.7  million due in fiscal
2023,

The Optimum Strategies Action asserts claims under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,
as amended (the

as well as public statements between
February 2020
and
May 2020,
in connection with certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID- 19
global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks damages, interest, costs, attorney’s fees, and equitable relief.
USCF and USO intend to vigorously contest such claims and have moved for their dismissal.
Settlement of SEC and CFTC Investigations

registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID- 19
global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney’s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in

In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation
On
August 27, 2020,
purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc. DBA Golden International filed
two
separate derivative actions on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Andrew F Ngim, Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes, III, Nicholas D. Gerber, Robert L. Nguyen, and Peter M. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action

(the “Cantrell Action”) and Civil Action
No.
1:20 -cv- 06981
(the “AML Action”), respectively.
The complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections
10 (b),
20 (a) and
21D
of the
1934
Act, Rule
10b - 5
thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO’s disclosures and defendants’ alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in
2020
that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID- 19
global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney’s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action.
The Court entered and consolidated the Cantrell and AML Actions under the caption

June 30, 2022.
We are currently unable to predict the timing or outcome of, or reasonably estimate the possible losses or range of, possible losses resulting from these matters. It is reasonably possible that this estimate will change in the near term. An adverse outcome regarding these matters could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Other Contingencies
On
December 2, 2021,
Marygold became aware of certain activity indicative of potential fraud on its Fintech platform, which was still in beta testing stage of development, and associated with the opening of end-customer accounts. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form
10 -K filing, Marygold estimates that approximately
80
end-customer accounts were opened fraudulently that resulted in approximately $ 103,000
being misappropriated. Upon learning of this activity, Marygold removed its app from all App Stores including, Apple and Android, to prevent any fraudulent activity through opening of new accounts created on its platform. Marygold further believes that
no
personal identifiable information was compromised. Marygold continues to monitor the security measures of its Fintech platform while continuing development. The accrual of approximately $ 250,000
was recorded through other income (expense) during the quarter ended
December 31, 2021,
and was reduced by approximately $ 147,000
during the year ended
June 30, 2022  as the total amount of the estimated loss decreased.

NOTE

SEGMENT REPORTING
With the acquisition of USCF Investments, Gourmet Foods, Brigadier, and the launch of the Original Sprout business unit of Kahnalytics, the Company has identified
four
segments for its products and services; U.S.A. investment fund management, U.S.A. beauty products, New Zealand food industry and Canada security alarm systems. Our recently incorporated subsidiaries, Marygold and Marygold UK, have  not
begun operations, so their accounts have been consolidated with those of the parent, The Marygold Companies, and are
not
identified as a separate segment. The Company's reportable segments are business units located in different global regions. The Company’s operations in the U.S.A. include the manufacture and wholesale distribution of hair and skin care products by Original Sprout and the income derived from management of various investment funds by our subsidiary USCF Investments. In New Zealand operations include the production, packaging and distribution on a commercial scale of gourmet meat pies and related bakery confections, and the printing of specialized food wrappers through our wholly owned subsidiary Gourmet Foods and its subsidiary, Printstock. In Canada, the Company provides security alarm system installation and maintenance services to residential and commercial customers sold through its wholly owned subsidiary, Brigadier. Separate management of each segment is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies due to their particular regional location. The Company accounts for intra-company sales and expenses as if the sales or expenses were to
third
parties and eliminates them in the consolidation. Amounts are adjusted for currency translation as of the balance sheet date and presented in US dollars. The Company files income taxes as a combined group and records most income taxes at the parent level.

Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing and by more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See "Financial Statements."
Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of this report and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K.
Overview
The Marygold Companies, Inc. (“The Marygold Companies” or the “Company”) conducts business through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries operating in the U.S., New Zealand, and Canada. Further, the Company anticipates operating in the United Kingdom upon the consummation of the pending acquisition of Tiger Financial & Asset Management Limited, a U.K. limited company. The operations of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are more particularly described herein but are summarized as follows:
●
USCF Investments, Inc. ("USCF Investments") (f/k/a Wainwright Holdings, Inc.), a U.S. based company, is the sole member of two investment services limited liability company subsidiaries, United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), and USCF Advisers LLC (“USCF Advisers”), each of which manages, operates or is an investment advisor to exchange traded funds organized as limited partnerships or investment trusts that issue shares which trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange..
●
Gourmet Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand based company, manufactures and distributes New Zealand meat pies on a commercial scale and its wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary company, Printstock Products Limited, prints specialty wrappers for the food industry in New Zealand and Australia. (collectively "Gourmet Foods")
●
Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Ltd. (“Brigadier”), a Canadian based company, sells and installs commercial and residential alarm monitoring systems.
●
Kahnalytics, Inc. dba/Original Sprout (“Original Sprout”), a U.S. based company, is engaged in the wholesale distribution of hair and skin care products under the brand name Original Sprout on a global scale.
●
Marygold & Co., a newly formed U.S. based company, together with its wholly owned limited liability company, Marygold & Co. Advisory Services, LLC,  (collectively "Marygold") was established by The Marygold Companies to explore opportunities in the financial technology ("Fintech") space, still in the development stage as of December 31, 2022, and estimated to launch commercial services in the current fiscal year. Through December 31, 2022, expenditures have been limited to developing the business model and the associated application development.
●
Marygold & Co. (UK) Limited, a newly formed U.K. limited company (“Marygold UK”), was established to act as a holding company for acquisitions to be made in the U.K. As of December 31, 2022, the accounts of Marygold UK are consolidated with its wholly owned subsidiary, Tiger Financial and Asset Management Limited.
Because the Company conducts its businesses through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, the risks related to our wholly owned subsidiaries are also risks that impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  See, " Note 2. Summary of   Significant Accounting Policies   / Major Customers and Suppliers - Concentration of Credit Risk " in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. The emergence of a novel coronavirus on a global scale, known as COVID-19, and related geopolitical events could lead to increased market volatility, disruption to U.S. and world economies and markets and may have significant adverse effects on the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The financial risk to future operations is largely unknown, (refer to Part II, Item 1A, for further details.)

Results of Operations
The Marygold Companies and Subsidiaries
Financial summary and comparison data for the three month periods ended December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021.
For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue and Operating Income
Consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $8.8 million representing a $0.6 million decrease from the three months ended December 31, 2021 revenue of $9.4 million. The decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily attributed to a decrease of $0.4 million in revenues of USCF Investments which were impacted by lower assets under Assets Under Management ("AUM"). The remainder of the revenue decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021,  related to a decrease of approximately $0.2 million from Original Sprout and a $0.2 million decrease from Gourmet Foods, offset by our recent Marygold UK acquisition which contributed $0.3 million to overall revenue compared to $0 during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Marygold Companies produced an operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.1 million as compared to an operating income of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This represents an decrease in operating income of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Apart from the $0.7 million decline in revenues, the difference in operating income is attributed to higher general & administrative ("G&A") expenses and additional expenses incurred by our subsidiary, Marygold & Co., in development of its mobile fintech app, which amounted to approximately $0.7 million.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other income (expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2022  increased $408 thousand compared to the same period in 2021 due to higher interest income and unrealized investment gains, and were $189 thousand and ($219) thousand, respectively, resulting in income before income tax of $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
Income Tax
Provision for income tax for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $107 thousand and $84 thousand, respectively, primarily attributable to our United States operations through our USCF Investments subsidiary. Income tax expense recorded at The Marygold Companies level totaled $92 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, while a tax expense of $21 thousand was recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The remaining income tax expense was recorded at the subsidiary level during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Net Income
Overall, the net income between the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 decreased by approximately $0.8 million, or approximately 81%, to approximately $0.2 million. The decrease in net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to $0.7 million in lower revenue and $0.2 million lower cost of revenue in addition to $0.7 million in higher operating expenses offset by a $0.4 million increase in other income.
Comprehensive Income
After giving consideration to currency translation gain (loss) of approximately $0.3 million our comprehensive income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.5 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 where there was a currency translation loss of ($14) thousand which resulted in comprehensive income of $1.0 million. Comprehensive gain and loss are comprised of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and effects in the valuation of our holdings in the U.K., New Zealand and Canada.
For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022   Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue and Operating Income
Consolidated revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $17.7 million representing a $1.5 million decrease from the same prior year period revenue of $19.2 million. Net revenues declined from our fund management business as a result of lower AUM by approximately $0.7 million, or 6%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company's revenues derived from its other operating units decreased by $1.1 million, or 14%, from the same prior year period offset by $0.3 million from our Marygold UK subsidiary which had $0 revenue in the prior year six month period, resulting in an overall decrease in consolidated revenue of approximately 8%. The Marygold Companies produced an operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.9 million as compared to an operating loss of ($0.3) million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the $2.5 million SEC / CFTC Wells Notice settlement incurred in the prior year six month period  in addition to lower revenue from USCF Investments and our other operating subsidiaries.
Other (Expense) Income
Other income (expense) for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $350 thousand compared to the same period in 2021 due to higher interest income and unrealized investment gains, and were $136 thousand and ($214) thousand, respectively, resulting in income (loss) before taxes of $1.0 million and ($0.5) million, respectively.
Income Tax
Provision for income tax for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.3 million for both periods, primarily attributable to our United States operations through our USCF Investment subsidiary. The Company files income taxes as a combined group and records most income taxes at the Parent level.

Net   Income (Loss) and Comprehensive   Income (Loss)
Overall, the net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $1.5 million. The increase in profits for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the $2.5 million SEC / CFTC Wells Notice settlement  recorded in the prior year reporting period in addition to lower revenue from each of our operating subsidiaries. Adding to the loss were expenses of $1.4 million related to our development stage subsidiary, Marygold. After giving consideration to currency translation gain of  $20 thousand our comprehensive income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.7 million as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 where there was a currency translation loss of ($101) thousand resulting in a comprehensive loss of ($1.0) million. Comprehensive gain and loss are comprised of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to the effects in the valuation of our holdings in New Zealand and Canada.

USCF Investments earns monthly management and advisory fees based on agreements with each Fund as determined by the contractual basis point management fee structure in each agreement multiplied by the average AUM over the given period. Many of the company’s expenses are dependent upon the amount of AUM. These variable expenses include Fund administration, custody, accounting, transfer agency, marketing and distribution, and sub-adviser fees and are primarily determined by multiplying contractual fee rates by AUM. Total Operating Expenses are grouped into the following financial statement line items: General and Administrative, Marketing, Operations and Salaries and Compensation.

For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue
Average AUM for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was at $3.8 billion, as compared to approximately $4.2 billion from the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in USO, CPER and USL AUM partially offset by an increase in UMI, UNG and USCI AUM. As a result, the revenues from management and advisory fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million, or 8%, to $5.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 where revenues from management and advisory fees totaled $5.7 million.
Expenses
USCF Investments total operating expenses for three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately $100 thousand to $3.7 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Variable expenses, as described above, decreased by $215 thousand due to a decrease in total AUM along with a new negotiated agreement with the existing marketing distributor resulting in lower fees, which included a $257 thousand decrease in variable marketing and distribution expenses, and offset by a small increase in fund accounting and administration expenses and in sub-advisory fees related to an increase in UMI AUM over the prior year quarter. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased $333 thousand to $641 thousand from $308 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. G&A expenses increased  primarily due to higher legal and professional expenses related to new future fund launches. Total marketing expenses decreased $237 thousand to $336 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $573 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to the new reduced fee agreement with the existing marketing distributor as noted above. Employee salaries and benefit compensation expenses were approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to allocating employee costs related to time working at the  Marygold Companies, Inc.  corporate level. Operations expenses remained flat at $1.1 million during the quarter compared to the prior year quarter.
Income
Operating income decreased $0.4 million to $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Other income (expense) was $180 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $38 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to unrealized losses in investments and interest income. Net income before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $0.2 million to $1.8 million compared to $2.0 million for three months ended December 31, 2021 due to a $0.4 million decrease in revenue as a result of lower AUM, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in total expenses and a $0.1 million increase in Other income.
For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue
Average AUM for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was at $3.8 billion, as compared to approximately $4.2 billion from the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in USO, BNO and USL AUM. As a result, the revenues from management and advisory fees decreased by approximately $0.7 million, or 6%, to $10.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 where revenues from management and advisory fees totaled $11.4 million.

Excluding the Wells Notice settlement, total operating expenses decreased $42 thousand, or approximately 1%. Variable expenses, as described above, decreased $0.2 million over the respective six -month period due to lower overall average AUM offset by an increase of $0.1 million in sub-advisory fees for UMI which did not exist for the full prior year six month period, as well as with small offset increases in UMI, USCI and CPER sub-advisory fees due to increases in their respective AUM from the prior year six month period, offset by lower expenses related to other fund AUM which decreased variable marketing and distribution expenses, fund accounting and administration expenses. G&A expenses, excluding new fund development cost, were $1.0 million and $0.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. G&A expenses increased $0.2 million due to increases in travel & entertainment and professional fees. Total marketing expenses decreased $0.2 million to $0.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year period due to an decrease in variable distribution costs as a result of lower AUM  and reduced rates in marketing distribution expenses as mentioned above partially offset by an increase in conference expenses. Employee salaries and benefit compensation expenses were approximately $2.7 million and $2.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Pats Pantry was founded in 1966 to produce and sell wholesale bakery products, meat pies and patisserie cakes and slices, in New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, located in Tauranga, New Zealand, sells substantially all of its goods to supermarkets and service station chains with stores located throughout New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, Ltd. also has a large number of smaller independent lunch bars, cafes and corner dairies among the customer list, however they comprise a relatively insignificant dollar volume in comparison to the primary accounts of large distributors and retailers. On July 1, 2020, Gourmet Foods, Ltd. acquired the New Zealand company, Printstock Products Limited. Located in nearby Napier, New Zealand, Printstock prints wrappers for food products, including those used by Gourmet Foods, Ltd. Printstock is a wholly owned subsidiary of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. and its operating results are consolidated with those of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. from July 1, 2020 onwards.

Beauty Products - Original Sprout
Kahnalytics was founded in 2015 and adopted the dba/Original Sprout in December 2017. Original Sprout formulates and packages various hair and skin care products that are 100% vegan, tested safe and non-toxic, and marketed globally through distribution networks to salons, resorts, grocery stores, health food stores, e-tail sites and on the company's website. The company operates from warehouse and sales offices located in San Clemente, CA, USA. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Original Sprout has made adjustments to its primary channels to market. Prior to the pandemic Original Sprout relied heavily upon its wholesale distribution network to place products at retail locations and generally to make products available to consumers, whereas in the current environment of social distancing and closures of retail businesses the company found a significant drop in sales volumes as consumers avoided traditional sales outlets. Moreover, distributors found it more profitable to sell directly to consumers via ecommerce that to sell wholesale to resellers. The result was a dramatic downturn in the average selling price of Original Sprout products on ecommerce sites as distributors began selling to end users at wholesale price. In response to this trend, Original Sprout has established new sales channels with online retailers and also reconstructed many of its distribution agreements and pricing tiers. The positive effects of this transition are expected to take up to 12 months to realize, while the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wholesale distribution business seems to be easing somewhat and management expects overall positive results to occur in the global marketplace. The company has also incurred expenses related to new product development and creation of upcoming marketing collateral, which is expected to continue well into calendar year 2023 as the company pursues its growth initiatives.

Financial Services - Marygold & Co. (UK) Limited
Marygold & Co. (UK) Limited was formed in August 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Marygold Companies.

Tiger is an asset manager and investment advisor operating pursuant to certification by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom. Tiger derives revenues from providing ongoing investment advice to clients as a percentage of total Assets Under Management (‘AUM’) which, as of December 31, 2022, totaled approximately £35 million. Additionally, the company earns fees and commissions on the sale of insurance-based products and other financial instruments secured through third parties. Results of operations for the period from June 20, 2022 through June 30, 2022 were insignificant and thus combined with those of the parent. Because the company has only begun operations in the current fiscal year, there is no comparison data for the prior year period. The accounts of Tiger are consolidated with those of Marygold UK.
Marygold UK operates exclusively in the U.K. and thus the Great Britain Pound (“GBP”) is its functional currency.

Plan of Operation for the Next Twelve Months
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to apply necessary resources, which may include experienced personnel, cash, or synergistic acquisitions made with cash, equity or debt, into growing each of our business units to their potential. Original Sprout is transitioning from a largely boutique offering distributed through specialty wholesalers to a more mainstream product available at traditional outlets and online and as such we anticipate measurable growth in revenues for the coming years, though there may be one-time initial expenses associated with the launch of new sales channels. Additionally, we are expecting moderate growth in Brigadier through focused management initiatives and consolidation within the security industry coupled with expanded product offerings. Similarly, we expect Gourmet Foods to be operating more efficiently under current management and continue to increase market share through additional product offerings and channels to market, including the printing and sale of food wrappers by their subsidiary, Printstock. USCF Investments expects to continue development of innovative and new fund products to grow its portfolio. In addition to our long-term mission that is an acquisition strategy based upon identifying and acquiring profitable, mature, companies of a diverse nature and with in-place management that produces increased revenue streams, the Company is also focused upon building expertise and developing Fintech opportunities in the financial services sector through its development stage subsidiary Marygold and Co. In a more general sense, the Company is characterizing its business in two categories: 1) financial services and 2) other consumer-based operating units. The purpose is to isolate the cyclical, and sometimes volatile, nature of the financial services business from our other industry segments. As revenues from financial services fluctuate over time due to varying performance of the commodities markets, our other operations are expected to be stable and sustainable by comparison. By these initiatives we seek to:
●
continue to gain market share for our wholly owned subsidiaries’ areas of operation,
●
increase our gross revenues and realize net operating profits,
●
lower our operating costs by unburdening certain selling expenses to third party distributors,
●
have sufficient cash reserves to pay down accrued expenses and losses,
●
attract parties who have an interest in selling their privately held companies to us,
●
achieve efficiencies in accounting and reporting through adoption of standards used by all subsidiaries on a consistent basis,
●
strategically pursue additional company acquisitions, and
●
explore opportunities as may present themselves in the Fintech space, including the launch of services by Marygold and Marygold Advisory Services, and the creation of new corporate entities as focused subsidiary holdings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Marygold Companies is a holding company that conducts its operations through its subsidiaries. At the holding-company level, its liquidity needs relate to operational expense, the funding of additional business acquisitions and new investment opportunities. Our operating subsidiaries' principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, debt service, and capital expenditures, including purchases of equipment and services, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. Cash is managed at the holding company or the subsidiary level. There are no limitations or constraints on the movement of funds between the entities.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $14.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis as compared to $12.9 million as of June 30, 2022.
During the past five fiscal years combined, The Marygold Companies has invested an aggregate of approximately $6.6 million in cash towards purchasing and assimilating Printstock within Gourmet Foods, and adding the Original Sprout assets into the The Marygold Companies group of companies as well as forming a new U.K. limited company, Marygold UK, and funding it with enough capital to pay approximately $1.8 million in cash towards the $2.9 million purchase price of its subsidiary, Tiger. We have also invested approximately $6.8 million in the development of Fintech applications through our development stage subsidiary, Marygold. Despite these cash investments and expenses, our working capital position remains strong at $22 million. While The Marygold Companies intends to maintain and improve its revenue stream from wholly owned subsidiaries, The Marygold Companies continues to pursue acquisitions of other profitable companies which meet its target profile. Provided The Marygold Companies’ subsidiaries continue to operate as they are presently, and are projected to operate, The Marygold Companies has sufficient capital to pay its general and administrative expenses for the coming fiscal year and to adequately pursue its long-term business objectives. However, given the significant economic and financial market disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in the Ukraine, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Lease Liability
The Company has various operating leases. The total amount due under these obligations was $1,251,674 and $1,404,880 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The obligations will reduce over the passage of time through periodic lease payments. See Note 15 for further analysis of this obligation.

Investments
USCF Investments, from time to time, provides initial investments in the creation of ETP funds that USCF Investments manages. USCF Investments classifies these investments as current assets as these investments are generally sold within one year from the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, USCF Investments held an initial investment position of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively,  in one of its 40 Act funds, GLDX. This investment along with other investments, as applicable, are described further in Note 7 to our Financial Statements.
Dividends
Our strategy on dividends is to declare and pay dividends only from retained earnings and only when our Board of Directors deems it prudent and in the best interests of the Company to declare and pay dividends. We paid no dividends during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Marygold Companies maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurances that the information required to be disclosed in The Marygold Companies’ periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures and any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
The duly appointed officers of The Marygold Companies, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of The Marygold Companies, have evaluated the effectiveness of The Marygold Companies’ disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of The Marygold Companies were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
(b)
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries may be involved in legal proceedings arising primarily from the ordinary course of their respective businesses. Except as described below there are no pending legal proceedings against the Company. USCF is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  USCF, as the general partner of USO and the general partner and sponsor of the related public funds may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. Except as described herein, USO and USCF are not currently party to any material legal proceedings.
Optimum Strategies Action
On April 6, 2022, USO and USCF were named as defendants in an action filed by Optimum Strategies Fund I, LP, a purported investor in call option contracts on USO (the “Optimum Strategies Action”). The action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut at Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-00511.
The Optimum Strategies Action asserts claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act. It purports to challenge statements in registration statements that became effective in February 2020, March 2020, and on April 20, 2020, as well as public statements between February 2020 and May 2020, in connection with certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks damages, interest, costs, attorney’s fees, and equitable relief.
USCF and USO intend to vigorously contest such claims and have moved for their dismissal.
Settlement of SEC and CFTC Investigations
On November 8, 2021, one of The Marygold Companies, Inc.’s (the “Company”) indirect subsidiaries, the United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), together with United States Oil Fund, LP (“USO”), for which USCF is the general partner, announced a resolution with each of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) relating to matters set forth in certain Wells Notices issued by the staffs of each of the SEC and CFTC, as detailed below.
On August 17, 2020, USCF, USO, and John Love received a “Wells Notice” from the staff of the SEC (the “SEC Wells Notice”). The SEC Wells Notice stated that the SEC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
Subsequently, on August 19, 2020, USCF, USO, and Mr. Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the CFTC (the “CFTC Wells Notice”). The CFTC Wells Notice stated that the CFTC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the CFTC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 4o(1)(A) and (B) and 6(c)(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6o(1)(A), (B), 9(1) (2018), and CFTC Regulations 4.26, 4.41, and 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.26, 4.41, 180.1(a) (2019).
On November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF and USO, the SEC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act, directing USCF and USO to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3) (the “SEC Order”). In the SEC Order, the SEC made findings that, from April 24, 2020 to May 21, 2020, USCF and USO violated Section 17(a)(3) of 1933 Act, which provides that it is “unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.” USCF and USO consented to entry of the SEC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction.
Separately, on November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF, the CFTC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the CEA, directing USCF to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 6o(1)(B), and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(a)(2) (the “CFTC Order”). In the CFTC Order, the CFTC made findings that, from on or about April 22, 2020 to June 12, 2020, USCF violated Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), which make it unlawful for any commodity pool operator (“CPO”) to engage in “any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant” and prohibit a CPO from advertising in a manner which “operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant,” respectively. USCF consented to entry of the CFTC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction.
Pursuant to the SEC Order and the CFTC Order, in addition to the command to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, and CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(2), civil monetary penalties totaling two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) in the aggregate were paid to the SEC and CFTC, of which one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) was paid by USCF to each of the SEC and the CFTC, respectively, pursuant to the offsets permitted under the orders. The SEC Order can be accessed at www.sec.gov and the CFTC Order can be accessed at www.cftc.gov.

In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation
On June 19, 2020, USCF, USO, John P. Love, and Stuart P. Crumbaugh were named as defendants in a putative class action filed by purported shareholder Robert Lucas (the “Lucas Class Action”).  The Court thereafter consolidated the Lucas Class Action with two related putative class actions filed on July 31, 2020 and August 13, 2020, and appointed a lead plaintiff.  The consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption
In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation,
Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-04740.
On November 30, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the “Amended Lucas Class Complaint”). The Amended Lucas Class Complaint asserts claims under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and Rule 10b-5.  The Amended Lucas Class Complaint challenges statements in registration statements that became effective on February 25, 2020 and March 23, 2020 as well as subsequent public statements through April 2020 concerning certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war.  The Amended Lucas Class Complaint purports to have been brought by an investor in USO on behalf of a class of similarly-situated shareholders who purchased USO securities between February 25, 2020 and April 28, 2020 and pursuant to the challenged registration statements.  The Amended Lucas Class Complaint seeks to certify a class and to award the class compensatory damages at an amount to be determined at trial as well as costs and attorney’s fees.  The Amended Lucas Class Complaint named as defendants USCF, USO, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes III, as well as the marketing agent, ALPS Distributors, Inc., and the Authorized Participants: ABN Amro, BNP Paribas Securities Corporation, Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Company, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC.
The lead plaintiff has filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of its claims against BNP Paribas Securities Corporation, Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Company, Inc., Nomura Securities International, Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, and UBS Securities LLC.
USCF, USO, and the individual defendants in

Mehan Action
On August 10, 2020, purported shareholder Darshan Mehan filed a derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes, III (the “Mehan Action”). The action is pending in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda as Case No. RG20070732.
The Mehan Action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to USO and failed to act in good faith in connection with a March 19, 2020 registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney’s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in

USCF, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest such claims.
In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation
On August 27, 2020, purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc. DBA Golden International filed two separate derivative actions on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Andrew F Ngim, Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes, III, Nicholas D. Gerber, Robert L. Nguyen, and Peter M. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 (the “Cantrell Action”) and Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06981 (the “AML Action”), respectively.
The complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 21D of the 1934 Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO’s disclosures and defendants’ alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in 2020 that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney’s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action.
