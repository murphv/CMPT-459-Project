BASIS OF PRESENTATION In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of operating results for the interim periods presented. Adjustments consist of normal and recurring accruals. The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all disclosures required for annual financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Over the past 18 months, Emerson Electric Co. ("Emerson" or the "Company") has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the combination of its industrial software businesses with Aspen Technology, Inc., with the Company owning 55 percent of the outstanding shares of the combined entity on a fully diluted basis upon closing of the transaction on May 16, 2022, the sale of its Therm-O-Disc business, which was completed on May 31, 2022, the sale of its InSinkErator business, which was completed on October 31, 2022, and the sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business, which was announced on October 31, 2022, and is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This includes reporting financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and the assets and liabilities of Climate Technologies and InSinkErator (prior to completion of the divestiture) as held-for-sale (see Note 5). In addition, as a result of its portfolio transformation, the Company now reports six segments and two business groups (see Note 13).

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Emerson is a global manufacturer that combines technology and engineering to provide innovative solutions to its customers, largely in the form of tangible products. The vast majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, while a smaller portion is recognized over time or relates to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations. See Note 13 for additional information about the Company's revenues. The following table summarizes the balances of the Company's unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are reported in Other assets (current and noncurrent), and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in Accrued expenses and Other liabilities.      Sept 30, 2022 Dec 31, 2022 Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $ 1,390   1,412   Customer advances (contract liabilities) ( 776 ) ( 938 )       Net contract assets (liabilities) $ 614   474        The majority of the Company's contract balances relate to (1) arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule, and (2) revenue from term software lice nse arrangements sold by AspenTech where the license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery. The decrease in net contract assets was due to customer billings exceeding revenue recognized for performance completed during the period. Revenue recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included $ 335
that was included in the beginning contract liability balance. Other factors that impacted the change in net contract assets were immaterial. Revenue recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company's long-term contracts, was not material.
6 As of December 31, 2022, the Company's backlog relating to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in contracts with its customers was approximately $ 7.8
billion . The Company expects to recognize appro ximately
80
percent of its
remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next
12
months, with the remainder substantially over the following two years.

Earnings allocated to participating securities were inconsequential.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Aspen Technology On May 16, 2022, the Company
completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. ("Heritage AspenTech") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business ( collectively, the “Emerson Industrial Software Business”) , along with approximately $ 6.0  billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create "New AspenTech", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as "AspenTech"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned
55
percent
of the outstanding shares of New AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech’s previous name “Aspen Technology, Inc.” and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech’s previous stock ticker symbol “AZPN.” The business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Emerson considered the accounting acquirer of Heritage AspenTech. The net assets of Heritage AspenTech were recorded at their estimated fair value and for the Emerson Industrial Software Business continue at their historical basis. The Company recorded a noncontrolling interest of $ 5.9
billion for the
45
percent ownership interest of former Heritage AspenTech stockholders in AspenTech. The noncontrolling interest associated with the Heritage AspenTech acquired net assets was recorded at fair value determined using the closing market price per share of Heritage AspenTech as of May 16, 2022, while the portion attributable to the Emerson Industrial Software business was recorded at its historical carrying amount. The impact of recognizing the noncontrolling interest in the Emerson Industrial Software Business resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $ 550 .
The following table summarizes the components of the purchase consideration reflected in the acquisition accounting using Heritage AspenTech's shares outstanding and closing market price per share as of May 16, 2022 (in millions except share and per share data):
Heritage AspenTech shares outstanding 66,662,482   Heritage AspenTech share price $ 166.30   Purchase price $ 11,086   Value of stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination service 102   Total purchase consideration $ 11,188   7 The total purchase consideration for Heritage AspenTech was allocated to assets and liabilities as follows.
Cash and equivalents $ 274   Receivables 43   Other current assets 280   Property, plant equipment 4   Goodwill ($ 34
expected to be tax-deductible) 7,225   Other intangible assets 4,390   Other assets 513   Total assets 12,729   Short-term borrowings 27   Accounts payable 8   Accrued expenses 113   Long-term debt 255   Deferred taxes and other liabilities 1,138   Total purchase consideration $ 11,188   Emerson's cash contribution of
approximately $ 6.0  billion was paid out at approximately $ 87.69
per share (on a fully diluted basis) to holders of issued and outstanding shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock as of the closing of the transactions, with $ 168
of cash remaining on AspenTech's balance sheet as of the closing which is not included in the allocation of purchase consideration above.
The estimated intangible assets attributable to the transaction are comprised of the following
(in millions) : Amount Estimated Weighted Average Life (Years) Developed technology
$ 1,350   10 Customer relationships
2,300   15 Trade names 430   Indefinite-lived Backlog 310   3 Total
$ 4,390   Results of operations for the first quarter of 2023 attributable to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition include sales of $ 168
while the impact to GAAP net earnings was not material.
Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited proforma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech occurred on Oct ober 1, 2020. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred as of that time ($ in millions, except per share amounts).
Three Months Ended December 31,   2021   Net Sales $ 3,327   Net earnings from continuing operations common stockholders $ 734   Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.23   8 The pro forma results for the three months ended December 31, 2021 include $ 32
of transaction costs which were assumed to be incurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2021.
Of these transaction costs, $ 22
were included in the Company's reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2021, but have been excluded from the fiscal 2022 pro forma results above. In addition, Heritage AspenTech incurred $ 68
of transaction costs prior to the completion of the acquisition that were not included in Emerson's reported results.
The pro forma results for the three months ended December 31, 2021 include estimated interest exp ense of $ 37
related to the issuance of $ 3
billion of term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the acquisition. Other Transactions On July 27, 2022, AspenTech entered into an agreement to acquire Micromine, a global leader in design and operational solutions for the mining industry, for AU$ 900
(approximately $ 623
USD based on exchange rates when the transaction was announced). The transaction is expected to close as soon as the remaining regulatory approval is obtained.
On May 4, 2022, Emerson announced its intention to exit business operations in Russia and divest Metran, its Russia-based manufacturing subs idiary, and on September 27, 2022, announced an agreement to sell the business to the local management group. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a pretax loss of $ 47
in Other deductions ($ 47
after-tax, in total $ 0.08
per share) related to its exit of business operations in Russia. The transaction will be subject to regulatory and government approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Emerson will work closely with the local Russia management group to help ensure a smooth transition for employees through the sale process. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company received a distribution of $ 438
related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv (in total, a pretax gain of $ 453
was recognized in the first quarter, $ 358
after-tax, $ 0.60
per share). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $ 75
which are expected to be received over the next
two -to- three
years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In October 2022, the Board of Directors approved the Company's announced agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $ 14.0
billion transaction. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $ 9.5
billion and a note of $ 2.25
billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a
45
percent non-controlling interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $ 5.0
billion and pretax earnings of $ 1.0
billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
On October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $ 3.0  billion. This business had net sales of $ 630
and pretax earnings of $ 152
in fiscal 2022. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $ 2.8

billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. On May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $ 486
($ 429
after-tax) in the third fiscal quarter of 2022. 9 The financial results of Climate Technologies, InSinkErator ("ISE") and Therm-O-Disc ("TOD") (through the completion of the divestitures), are reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and were as follows: Climate Technologies ISE and TOD Total   Three Months Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31,   2021   2022   2021   2022   2021   2022   Net sales

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Hedging Activities
– As of December 31, 2022, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was approximately $ 5.2
billion, and commodity hedge contracts totaled approximately $ 115
(primarily
33
million pounds of copper and aluminum). All derivatives receiving hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of December 31, 2022 are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives reported in Other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receive hedge accounting.
Net Investment Hedge
– In fiscal 2019, the Company issued euro-denominated debt of € 1.5
billion. The euro notes reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency and have been designated as a hedge of a portion of the investment in these operations. Foreign currency gains or losses associated with the euro-denominated debt are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
14 The following gains and losses are included in earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) for the three months ended
December 31, 2021 and 2022: Into Earnings Into OCI 1st Quarter 1st Quarter Gains (Losses) Location 2021   2022   2021   2022   Commodity Cost of sales $ 7   ( 8 ) 13   11   Foreign currency Sales 1   ( 1 ) —   4   Foreign currency Cost of sales 2   8   3   ( 3 ) Foreign currency Other deductions, net 44   5   Net Investment Hedges Euro denominated debt 44   ( 123 )      Total   $ 54   4   60   ( 111 ) Regardless of whether derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the as sessment of hedge effectiveness. Equity Investment
– The Company has an equity investment in National Instruments, valued at $ 82
as of December 31, 2022, and reported in Other current assets. On January 17, 2023, the Company announced a proposal to acquire National Instruments for $ 53
per share in cash at an implied enterprise value of $ 7.6
billion. National Instruments, which had fiscal 2021 sales of approximately $ 1.5
billion, announced on January 13, 2023 it was undertaking a strategic review which could include the solicitation of interest from other potential acquirors.
Fair Value Measurement
– Valuations for all derivatives and the Company's long-term debt fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of long-term debt was $ 7.7
billion, which was lower than the carrying value by $ 1,169 . The fair values of commodity and foreign currency contracts did not materially change since September 30, 2022. Foreign currency contracts were reported in Other current assets and Accrued expenses, while commodity contracts, which primarily relate to discontinued operations, were reported in Current assets and liabilities held-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's equity investment in National Instruments falls within Level 1 and was based on the most recent quoted closing market price from its principal exchange.
Counterparties to derivatives arran gements are companies with investment-grade credit ratings. The Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with counterparties with credit rating-based posting thresholds that vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below pre-established levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization of all derivatives in net liability positions. The maximum amount that could potentially have been required was immaterial. The Company also can demand full collateralization of derivatives in net asset positions should any counterparty credit ratings fall below certain thresholds.
No
collateral was posted with counterparties and
none
was held by the Company as of December 31, 2022.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS As disclosed in Note 5, the financial results of Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result of these portfolio actions, the Company has realigned its business segments and now reports six segments and two business groups, which are highlighted in the table below. The Company also reclassified certain product sales that were previously reported in Control Systems & Software to Discrete Automation. INTELLIGENT DEVICES SOFTWARE AND CONTROL
• Final Control • Control Systems & Software • Measurement & Analytical • AspenTech • Discrete Automation • Safety & Productivity The new segments were previously described as follows: Final Control was the Valves, Actuators & Regulators product offering; Measurement & Analytical was the Measurement & Analytical instrumentation product offering; Discrete Automation was the Industrial Solutions product offering; Safety & Productivity was the Tools & Home Products segment, excluding the divested InSinkErator business; Control Systems & Software was the Systems & Software product offering; and, AspenTech remains unchanged. The AspenTech segment was identified in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 as a result of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and reflects the combined results of Heritage AspenTech and the Emerson Industrial Software Business (see Note 4 for further details). The results for this new segment include the historical results of the Emerson Industrial Software Business (which were previously reported in the Control Systems & Software segment), while results related to the Heritage AspenTech business only include periods subsequent to the close of the transaction. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 16   Three Months Ended December 31,   Sales Earnings   2021   2022   2021   2022   Final Control $ 817   862   122   158   Measurement & Analytical 737   749   170   175   Discrete Automation 617   618   120   121   Safety & Productivity 351   310   65   63   Intelligent Devices 2,522   2,539   477   517   Control Systems & Software 570   606   116   107   AspenTech 82   243   ( 2 ) ( 33 ) Software and Control 652   849   114   74   Stock compensation ( 34 ) ( 102 ) Unallocated pension and postretirement costs 26   45   Corporate and other ( 55 ) ( 64 ) Gain on subordinated interest 453   —   Eliminations/Interest ( 18 ) ( 15 ) ( 39 ) ( 48 )      Total $ 3,156   3,373   942   422   Corporate and other for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included a

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Dollars are in millions, except per share amounts or where noted) OVERVIEW As previously disclosed, in October 2022, the Board of Directors approved the Company's announced agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the historical Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $14.0 billion transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Additionally, on October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion, and the Company recognized a pretax gain
of $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in
the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Climate Technologies, Therm-O-Disc and InSinkErator are reported within discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 5. On May 16, 2022, the Company
completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. ("Heritage AspenTech") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business, along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create "New AspenTech" (hereinafter referred to as "AspenTech"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent
of the outstanding shares of New AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). See Note 4. Due to the timing of the acquisition in the prior year, the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales from continuing operations were $3.4 billion, up 7 percent compared with the prior year. Underlying sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, were up 6 percent. The AspenTech acquisition added 5 percent, while foreign currency translation had a 4 percent unfavorable impact. Sales growth continued to be strong in North America, while Asia, Middle East & Africa was essentially flat and Europe was down modestly due to the negative impact of the business exit from Russia. Earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders were $329, down 56 percent, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.56, down 55 percent compared with $1.25 in the prior year. The prior year included a $0.60 gain related to the Company's subordinated interest in Vertiv. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.78 compared with $0.79 in the prior year, reflecting strong operating results offset by higher stock compensation expense due to an increasing stock price in the current year.
The table below presents the Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on an adjusted basis to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excludes intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction-related costs, and certain gains, losses or impairments.

Following is an analysis of the Company’s operating results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared with the first quarter ended December 31, 2022. 2021 2022 Change (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)       Net sales $ 3,156  3,373   7  % Gross profit $ 1,415  1,620   14  % Percent of sales 44.9  % 48.0   % 3.1 pts SG&A $ 849  1,030   21  % Percent of sales 27.0  % 30.5   % 3.5 pts Gain on subordinated interest $ (453) —   Other deductions, net $ 38  120     Amortization of intangibles $ 57  118   Restructuring costs $ 6  10   Interest expense, net $ 39  48     Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 942  422   (55) % Percent of sales 29.8  % 12.5   % (17.3) pts Earnings from continuing operations common stockholders $ 746  329   (56) % Percent of sales 23.6  % 9.8   % (13.8) pts Net earnings common stockholders $ 896  2,331   160  % Diluted EPS - Earnings from continuing operations $ 1.25  0.56   (55) % Diluted EPS - Net Earnings $ 1.50  3.97   165  % Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $3.4 billion, up 7 percent compared with 2022. Intelligent Devices sales were up 1 percent, while Software and Control sales were up 30 percent, which included the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying sales were up 6 percent
on 2 percent higher volume and 4 percent higher price, while
f or eign currency translation had a
4 percent
negative impact. The Heritage AspenTech acquisition added 5 percent. Underlying sales were up 12 percent in the U.S. and up 2 percent internationally. The Americas was up 13 percent, while Asia, Middle East & Africa was flat (China down 7 percent). Europe decreased 2 percent, but was up 7 percent excluding the negative impact of the business exit from Russia. 20 Cost of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $1,753, an increase of $12 compared with 2022. Gross margin of 48.0 percent increased 3.1 percentage points due to favorable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by
1.3 percentage points, and favorable mix. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expens es of $1,030 increased $181 and SG&A as a
percent of sales increased 3.5 percentage points to 30.5 percent
compared with the prior year, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $68, of which $45 related to Emerson stock plans due to an increasing stock price in the current year and $23 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company received a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv (in total, a gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share).
Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.
Other deductions, net were $120 in 2023, an increase of $82 compared with the prior year, reflecting
higher intangibles amortization of
$61
primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and
a charge of $47 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia, partially offset by lower acquisition/divestiture costs of $23. The current year also included
a mark-to-market
gain of $35 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTec h to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price, which was largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses compared to gains in the prior year. See Note 7.
Pretax earnings from continuing operations of $422 decreased $520, down 55 percent compared with the prior year largely due to the Vertiv gain discussed above. Earnings increased $40 in Intelligent Devices and decreased $40 in Software and Control, while costs reported at Corporate increased $58 largely due to higher stock compensation expense of $68 and the $47 Russia business exit loss, partially offset by the $ 35
gain on the Micromine
foreign currency forward contracts.
See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 13.
Income taxes were $98 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and $196 in 2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 23 percent and 21 percent, respectively. The current year rate included a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact related to the Russia charge, which had no related tax benefit.
Earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders were $329, down 56 percent, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.56, down 55 percent compared with $1.25 in the prior year. The prior year included a $0.60 gain related to the Company's subordinated interest in Vertiv. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.78 compared with $0.79 in the prior year, reflecting strong operating results offset by higher stock compensation expense due to an increasing stock price in the current year. See the analysis above of
adjusted earnings per share for further details. Earnings from discontinued operations were $2,002 ($3.41 per share) which included the $2.1 billion after-tax gain on the divestiture of InSinkErator, compared to $149 ($0.25 per share) in the prior year. Earnings from discontinued operations were negatively impacted in the current year by approximately $275 of income taxes within Climate Technologies related to subsidiary restructurings and $27 of transaction-related costs. See Note 5. Net earnings common stockholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $2,331, up 160 percent, compared with $896 in the prior year, and earnings per share were $3.97, up 165 percent, compared with $1.50 in the prior year.
The table below, which shows results from continuing operations on an adjusted EBITA basis, is intended to supplement the Company's discussion of its results of operations herein. The Company defines adjusted EBITA as earnings from continuing operations excluding interest expense, net, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction-related costs, and certain gains, losses or impairments.

24 FINANCIAL CONDITION Key elements of the Company's financial condition for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021 follow.   Dec 31, 2021 Sept 30, 2022 Dec 31, 2022 Operating working capital $ 780  $ 990  $ 351   Current ratio 2.4  1.1  1.1   Total debt-to-total capital 46.1  % 50.0  % 48.1   % Net debt-to-net capital 28.2  % 45.3  % 41.7   % Interest coverage ratio 23.9  X 11.7  X 7.3   X The Company's operating working capital as of December 31, 2022 includes income taxes payable of approximately $660 related to the gain on the InSinkErator divestiture, which is expected to be paid over the next three quarters, and approximately $275 related to subsidiary restructurings at Climate Technologies, approximately $230 of which was paid in January 2023 with the remainder expected to be paid by the end of fiscal 2023. Excluding these income taxes payable related to discontinued operations, operating working capital increased compared to the same quarter last year and compared to September 30, 2022 due to higher inventory levels to support sales growth and reflecting ongoing supply chain and logistics constraints. As of December 31, 2022, Emerson's cash and equivalents totaled $2,271, which included approximately $450 attributable to AspenTech. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in January 2023
AspenTech paid off the outstanding balance of its existing term loan facility of $264, plus accrued interest.
The cash held by AspenTech is intended to be used for its own purposes and is not a readily available source of liquidity for other Emerson general business purposes or to return to Emerson shareholders.
The current ratio was unchanged compared to September 30, 2022. The i nterest coverage ratio (earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense) of 7.3X for the first three months of fiscal 2023 compares to 23.9X for the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting lower pretax earnings and higher interest expense. Pretax earnings in the prior year included the Vertiv subordinated interest gain of
$453. Excluding the gain,
the interest coverage ratio was 12.9X in the prior year.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first three months of fiscal 2023 was $302, a decrease of $75 compared with $377 in the prior
year, reflecting higher working capital due to ongoing supply chain constraints. Operating cash flow included approximately $50 generated by AspenTech. Free cas h flow from continuing operations of $243 in the first three months of fiscal 2023 (operating cash flow of $302 less capital expenditures of $59) decreased $61 compared to free cash flow of $304 in 2022 (operating cash flow of $377 less capital expenditures of $73), reflecting the decrease in operating cash flow. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $67. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2,895, reflecting share repurchases of $2.0 billion, net repayments of short-term borrowings of $539, and dividend payments.
Total cash provided by operating activities was $418 including the impact of discontinued operations, and decreased $105 compared with $523 in the prior year. Investing cash flow from discontinued operations was $3.0 billion, reflecting proceeds from the InSinkErator divestiture.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provides tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act include the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $73 of certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year 2020, of which approximately $37 was paid in December 2021 and the remainder paid in December 2022. Emerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. Emerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and common stockholders' equity of $11 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.
25 FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOK
For the full year, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 8 to 10 percent, with underlying sales up 6.5 to 8.5 percent excluding a 2 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and an approximately 3.5 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures.
Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $3.55 to $3.70 (which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in Climate Technologies' income or loss post-close), while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $4.00 to $4.15, excluding a $0.60 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, $0.12 per share from restructuring actions, $0.08 per share from the Russia business exit, a $0.03 per share benefit from the AspenTech Micromine purchase price hedge, $0.09 per share from interest income on the Climate Technologies note receivable, and $0.23 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator divestitures. Earnings from discontinued operations are expected to be $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, or $18 to $20 per share, including the net gains on 2023 divestitures. The fiscal 2023 outlook includes $2 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchases completed in the first quarter and approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments. The Company's fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the Climate Technologies divestiture (assumed to close March 31, 2023 for the purposes of guidance) will reflect a 45 percent common equity ownership in the income, or loss, of Climate Technologies. Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The effect of Emerson's 45 percent share of Climate Technologies is expected to be immaterial to post-closing cash flows. Statements in this report that are not strictly historical may be "forward-looking" statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, and Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. These risks and uncertainties include the the Company's ability to successfully complete on the terms and conditions contemplated, and the financial impact of, the proposed Climate Technologies transaction, the potential National Instruments transaction, the scope, duration and ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as economic and currency conditions, market demand, including related to the pandemic and oil and gas price declines and volatility, pricing, protection of intellectual property, cybersecurity, tariffs, competitive and technological factors, inflation, among others, which are set forth in the “Risk Factors” of Part I, Item 1A, and the "Safe Harbor Statement" of Part II, Item 7, to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Item 4. Controls and Procedures  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner.

Based on an evaluation performed, the certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's reports. There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 26 PART II.
