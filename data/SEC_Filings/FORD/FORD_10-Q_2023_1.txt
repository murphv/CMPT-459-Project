NOTE 1                   OVERVIEW
Business
Forward Industries, Inc.
(“Forward”, “we”, “our” or the “Company”) is a global design, manufacturing, sourcing
and distribution company serving top tier medical and technology customers worldwide. As a result of the continued expansion of our design
development capabilities through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company is able to introduce proprietary products to the market from
concepts brought to it from a number of different sources, both inside and outside the Company.
Liquidity
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated a net loss of $ 430,000 ,
and used $ 149,000
of cash flows in operating activities. Based on our forecasted cash flows, we believe our existing cash balance and working capital
will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs through at least February 29, 2024. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 1,300,000
of borrowing available under its line of credit with a bank that has a maturity date of
May
31, 2023
(see Note 10). As this line of credit has been renewed on multiple prior occasions, management expects it will be
renewed again. Considering the loss of a significant OEM distribution segment customer (see Note 5) and the retail distribution
segment operating losses, management is planning to evaluate the Company’s cost structure and implement cost cutting
initiatives as deemed necessary. In light of these events, the Company is currently assessing the terms of its sourcing agreement
with Forward Industries Asia-Pacific Corporation (“Forward China”), which is scheduled to expire on October
22, 2023 (See Note 8). The Company and Forward China have agreed to begin negotiations on a new sourcing agreement early in
the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. While we believe a new agreement will be reached, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be
successful.  If an agreement cannot be reached, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s operations, we
will look at other alternatives for our OEM and retail distribution businesses prior to the expiration of the agreement.
Impact of COVID-19
The effects of the COVID-19
pandemic continue to impact our business with higher historical costs for ocean freight and ground transportation, particularly from the
Asia-Pacific region. We expect to see the benefits of declining ocean freight costs in future periods. Inflation, in part associated with
the pandemic, continues to increase the cost of acquiring and retaining our employees and acquiring inventory. The instability of transportation
costs and future inflation are still largely unknown but are expected to continue throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023
(“Fiscal 2023”).
The effects of COVID-19 may
further impact our business in ways we cannot predict, and such impacts could be significant. The current economic conditions may continue
to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in future periods as well as that of our customers,
including their ability to pay for our services and to choose to allocate their budgets to new or existing projects which may or may not
require our services. The long-term financial impact on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As a result, the effects
of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods.
Until the effects of the
pandemic and associated inflationary impact have fully receded, we expect business conditions to remain challenging.  In response
to these challenges, we will continue to focus on those factors that we can control: closely managing and controlling our expenses and
inventory levels; aligning our design and development schedules with demand in a proactive manner to minimize our cash operating costs;
pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of our development, selling and administrative activities and, where
appropriate, taking advantage of opportunities to enhance our business growth and strategy.

NOTE 2                   ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forward Industries, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Forward Industries
(IN), Inc. (“Forward US”), Forward Industries (Switzerland) GmbH (“Forward Switzerland”), Forward Industries UK
Limited (“Forward UK”), Intelligent Product Solutions, Inc. (“IPS”) and Kablooe, Inc. (“Kablooe”).
The terms “Forward”, “we”, “our” or the “Company” as used throughout this document are
used to indicate Forward Industries, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.
In the opinion of management,
the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect all normal recurring
adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented
herein but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the year ending September 30, 2023. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and with the disclosures and risk factors presented therein.
The September 30, 2022 condensed consolidated balance sheet has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Throughout this document,
certain dollar amounts and percentages have been rounded to their approximate values.
Segment Reporting
The Company has three reportable
segments: Original Equipment Manufacturing (“OEM”) distribution, retail distribution and design. The OEM distribution segment
sources and sells carrying cases and other accessories for medical monitoring and diagnostic kits and a variety of other portable electronic
and non-electronic devices directly to OEMs or their contract manufacturers worldwide. The retail distribution segment sources and sells
smart-enabled furniture, hot tubs and a variety of other products through various online retailer websites to customers predominantly
located in the U.S. The design segment consists of two operating segments (IPS and Kablooe, which have been aggregated into one reportable
segment) that provide a full spectrum of hardware and software product design and engineering services to customers predominantly located
in the U.S. See Note 5 for more information on segments.

FORWARD INDUSTRIES, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist
of unsecured trade accounts with customers in amounts that have been invoiced ($ 8,900,000
and $ 7,861,000
at December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, respectively) and contract assets as described further below under the heading “Revenue Recognition.” The Company
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. Collectability of accounts receivable is estimated by evaluating the number of days accounts are outstanding, customer payment
history, recent payment trends and perceived creditworthiness, adjusted as necessary based on specific customer situations. At December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had
no
allowances for doubtful accounts for the OEM distribution segment, allowances for
doubtful accounts of $ 32,000
and $ 20,000 , respectively, for the retail distribution segment and $ 837,000
and $ 852,000 , respectively, for
the design segment.
The Company has agreements
with various retailers which contain different terms for trade discounts, promotional and other sales allowances. At December 31, 2022
and September 30, 2022, the Company recorded accounts receivable allowances of $ 110,000
and $ 55,000 , respectively, for the retail distribution
segment.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily
of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Based on
management’s estimates, an allowance is made to reduce excess, obsolete, or otherwise unsellable inventories to net realizable value.
The allowance is established through charges to cost of sales in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In determining the adequacy of the allowance, management’s estimates are based upon several factors, including analyses of inventory
levels, historical loss trends, sales history and projections of future sales demand. The Company’s estimates of the allowance may
change from time to time based on management’s assessments, and such changes could be material. At December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, the allowance for slow-moving inventory, which relates entirely to our retail segment, was $ 460,000
and $ 535,000 , respectively.
Revenue Recognition
OEM Distribution Segment
The OEM distribution segment
recognizes revenue when: (i) finished goods are shipped to its customers (in general, these conditions occur at either point of shipment
or point of destination, depending on the terms of sale and transfer of control); (ii) there are no other deliverables or performance
obligations; and (iii) there are no further obligations to the customer after the title of the goods has transferred. If the Company receives
consideration before achieving the criteria previously mentioned, it records a contract liability, which is classified as a component
of deferred income in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The OEM distribution segment had
no
contract liabilities
at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021.
Retail Distribution Segment
The retail distribution segment
sells products primarily through online websites operated by authorized third-party retailers. Revenue is recognized when control (as
defined in Accounting Standards Codification, “ASC” 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) of the related
goods is transferred to the retailer, which generally occurs upon shipment to the end customer. Other than product delivery, the retail
distribution segment does not typically have other deliverables or performance obligations associated with its products. Revenue is measured
as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the products provided, net of allowances taken by retailers for
product returns and any taxes collected from customers that will be remitted to governmental authorities. When the Company receives consideration
before achieving the criteria previously mentioned, it records a contract liability, which is classified as a component of deferred income
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The retail distribution segment had
no
contract liabilities at December 31,
2022, September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021.

FORWARD INDUSTRIES, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Design Segment
The Company applies the “cost
to cost” and “right to invoice” methods of revenue recognition to the contracts with customers in the design segment.
The design segment typically engages in two types of contracts: (i) time and material and (ii) fixed price. The Company recognizes revenue
over time on its time and material contracts utilizing a “right to invoice” method. Revenues from fixed price contracts that
require performance of services that are not related to the production of tangible assets are recognized by using cost inputs to measure
progress toward the completion of its performance obligations, or the “cost to cost” method. Revenues from fixed price contracts
that contain specific deliverables are recognized when the performance obligation has been satisfied or the transfer of goods to the customer
has been completed and accepted.
Recognized revenues that
will not be billed until a later date, or contract assets, are recorded as an asset and classified as a component of accounts receivable
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The design segment had contract assets of $ 602,000 , $ 609,000
and $ 693,000
at
December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Contracts where collections to date have exceeded recognized
revenues, or contract liabilities, are recorded as a liability and classified as a component of deferred income in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets. The design segment had contract liabilities of $ 335,000 , $ 439,000
and $ 188,000
at December 31, 2022, September
30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.
Goodwill
The Company reviews goodwill
for impairment at least annually, or more often if triggering events occur. The Company has two reporting units with goodwill (the IPS
and Kablooe operating segments) and we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on September 30, the end of the fiscal year, or upon
the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is
more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for the
reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, then the Company
will perform the quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment charge is recognized. If the fair value of the reporting
unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying
amount exceeds its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests including estimating
the fair value of a reporting unit. Management evaluated and concluded that there were no indications goodwill was impaired at December
31, 2022.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include
trademarks and customer relationships, which were acquired as part of the acquisitions of IPS in Fiscal 2018 and Kablooe in Fiscal 2020
and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are periodically evaluated for reasonableness.
Our intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
In assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other
factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether
an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related
assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to our intangible assets. Management evaluated
and concluded that there were no indications of impairments of intangible assets at December 31, 2022.

FORWARD INDUSTRIES, INC. AND

Income Taxes
The Company recognizes future
tax benefits and liabilities measured at enacted rates attributable to temporary differences between financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities and to net tax operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of these benefits is more likely
than not. At December 31, 2022, there was no change to our assessment that a full valuation allowance was required against all net deferred
tax assets as it is not probable that such deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, any deferred tax provision or benefit was
offset by an equal and opposite change to the valuation allowance. Our income tax provision or benefit is generally not significant due
to the existence of significant net operating loss carryforwards.
Fair Value Measurements
We perform fair value measurements
in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement.” ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that
would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values,
we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would
use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. An asset’s or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
·
Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
·
Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
·
Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.
Leases
Lease assets and liabilities
are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, using the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the lease term, since the Company’s lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is
one readily available. The Company has certain leases that may include an option to renew and when it is reasonably probable to exercise
such option, the Company will include the renewal option terms in determining the lease asset and lease liability. Lease assets represent
the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Operating lease assets are shown as right of use assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The current and long-term
portions of operating lease liabilities are shown separately as such on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2019, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-11, “Codification Improvements
to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” ASU 2019-11 is an accounting pronouncement that provides clarity to
and amends earlier guidance on this topic and would be effective concurrently with the adoption of such earlier guidance. This pronouncement
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the effects of this pronouncement on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the future economic benefits of assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified or separately
recognized. The Company’s goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of Kablooe and IPS in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.
The goodwill associated with the IPS acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes, but the goodwill associated with the Kablooe acquisition
is deductible for tax purposes. All of the Company’s goodwill is held under the design segment of our business.
NOTE 4                   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The
earnout consideration of $ 30,000
and $ 70,000
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, represents the fair value of the
contingent earnout consideration related to the acquisition of Kablooe, which provides annual contingent earnout payments based on results
of operations through August 2025. The fair value of the earnout liability is measured on a recurring basis at each reporting date using
a Black-Scholes valuation model with inputs categorized within level three of the fair value hierarchy. The current and non-current portions
of this liability are shown in the corresponding categories on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in each period presented. During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reduced this liability from $70,000 to $30,000 based on changes to the expected
likelihood of Kablooe reaching the specified earnings targets. The resulting gain has been recorded as a component of other income on
the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
NOTE 5                   SEGMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS
The Company has three reportable
segments: OEM distribution, retail distribution and design. See Note 2 for more information on the composition and accounting policies
of our reportable segments.
Our chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews revenue and operating income for each segment to assess financial results and allocate resources.
For our OEM and retail distribution segments, we exclude general and administrative and general corporate expenses from their measure
of profitability as these expenses are not allocated to the segments and therefore not included in the measure of profitability used by
the CODM. For the design segment, general and administrative expenses directly attributable to that segment are included in its measure
of profitability as these expenses are included in the measure of its profitability reviewed by the CODM. We do not include intercompany
activity in our segment results shown below to be consistent with the information that is presented to the CODM. Segment assets consist
of accounts receivable and inventory, which are regularly reviewed by the CODM, as well as goodwill and intangible assets resulting from
design segment acquisitions.

from two customers or their affiliates or contract manufacturers represented
25.0 % and
25.2 %, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated
net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
For the three months ended
December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer in the design segment whose individual percentage of the Company’s consolidated
revenues was 10% or greater. Revenues from this customer represented
14.4 % of the Company’s consolidated net revenues for the three
months ended December 31, 2022. There were no customers in the design segment whose individual percentage of the Company’s consolidated
revenues was 10% or greater during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2022 and
September 30, 2022, the Company had customers in the OEM distribution segment whose accounts receivable balance accounted for 10% or more
of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from two customers or their affiliates or contract manufacturers
represented
37.0 % and
28.1 %, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, the
Company had one customer in the design segment whose accounts receivable balance accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated
accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from this customer represented

at December 31, 2022. There were no customers in the design segment whose individual percentage of the Company’s consolidated accounts
receivable was 10% or greater at September 30, 2022.
In March 2023, the Company’s
contract with one of its major diabetic customers in the OEM distribution segment will expire. Due to increased pricing pressures, the
Company will not be extending its contract with this customer. Revenue from this customer represented
12 % of our consolidated net revenues
for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company expects the loss of this customer to cause a significant decline
in OEM distribution segment revenues in future periods.

TRANSACTIONS
Buying Agency and Supply
Agreement
The Company has a Buying
Agency and Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Forward China. The Supply Agreement provides that, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Forward China will act as the Company’s exclusive buying agent and supplier of
Products (as defined in the Supply Agreement) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Company purchases products at Forward China’s cost
and pays Forward China a monthly service fee equal to the sum of: (i) $100,000 and (ii) 4% of “Adjusted Gross Profit”, which
is defined as the selling price less the cost from Forward China. The Supply Agreement expires October 22, 2023. Terence Wise, Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company, is the owner of Forward China. In addition, Jenny P. Yu, a Managing Director of Forward
China, beneficially owns more than 5% of the Company’s common stock. The Company recorded service fees to Forward China of $ 344,000
and $ 362,000
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are included as a component of cost of sales upon
sales of the related products. The Company and Forward China have agreed to begin negotiations on a new sourcing agreement early in the
third quarter of Fiscal 2023. While we believe a new agreement will be reached, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful.
If an agreement cannot be reached, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s operations, we will look at other alternatives
for our OEM and retail distribution businesses prior to the expiration of the agreement.
The Company has prepayments
to Forward China for inventory purchases of $ 20,000
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, which are included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Promissory Note
On January 18, 2018, the
Company issued a $ 1,600,000
unsecured promissory note payable to Forward China to fund the acquisition of IPS. The promissory note bears
an interest rate of
8 % per annum and had an original maturity date of January 18, 2019. Monthly interest payments commenced on February
18, 2018, with the principal due at maturity. The Company incurred and paid interest associated with this note of $ 28,000

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the notes
thereto, and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2022.  The following discussion and analysis compares our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 (the “2023 Quarter”) with those for the three months ended December 31, 2021 (the “2022
Quarter”). All dollar amounts and percentages presented herein have been rounded to approximate values.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains “forward-looking
statements”, as such term is used within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements
include, among other things, statements regarding our liquidity, plans on repaying outstanding debt obligations, expectations
regarding the effect of the pandemic and inflation on our business, as well as other statements regarding our future operations,
financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
“plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will
likely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those
reflected in the forward-looking statements. These risks include the inability to expand our customer base, loss of additional
customers, pricing pressures, lack of success of our sales people, failure to develop products at a profit, failure to commercialize
products that we develop, continued supply chain issues, inability of our design division’s customers to pay for our services,
unanticipated issues with our affiliated sourcing agent, issues at Chinese factories that source our products as a result of the
pandemic or otherwise, and failure to obtain acceptance of our products. No assurance can be given that the actual results will be
consistent with the forward-looking statements. Investors should read carefully the factors described in the “Risk
Factors” section of the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended
September 30, 2022 for information regarding risk factors that could affect the Company’s results.  We undertake no
obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Business Overview
Forward Industries, Inc.
is a global design, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution company serving top tier medical and technology customers worldwide. As a
result of the continued expansion of our design development capabilities through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, IPS and Kablooe, we are
now able to introduce proprietary products to the market from concepts brought to us from a number of different sources, both inside and
outside the Company.
Our design division provides
hardware and software product design and engineering services to customers predominantly located in the U.S. Our OEM distribution division
sources and sells carrying cases and other accessories for medical monitoring and diagnostic kits as well as a variety of other portable
electronic and non-electronic devises to OEMs, or their contract manufacturers worldwide, that either package our products as accessories
“in box” together with their branded product offerings or sell them through their retail distribution channels. Our retail
distribution division sources and sells smart-enabled furniture, hot tubs and various other products through online retailer websites
to customers predominately located in the U.S.
The effects of the COVID-19
pandemic continue to impact our business with higher historical costs for ocean freight and ground transportation, particularly from the
Asia-Pacific region. We expect to see the benefits of declining ocean freight costs in future periods. Inflation, in part associated with
the pandemic, continues to increase the cost of acquiring and retaining our employees and acquiring inventory. The instability of transportation
costs and future inflation are still largely unknown but are expected to continue throughout Fiscal 2023.
18
The effects of COVID-19 may
further impact our business in ways we cannot predict, and such impacts could be significant. The current economic conditions may continue
to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in future periods as well as that of our customers,
including their ability to pay for our services and to choose to allocate their budgets to new or existing projects which may or may not
require our services. The long-term financial impact on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As a result, the effects
of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods.
Until the effects of the
pandemic and associated inflationary impact have fully receded, we expect business conditions to remain challenging.  In response
to these challenges, we will continue to focus on those factors that we can control: closely managing and controlling our expenses and
inventory levels; aligning our design and development schedules with demand in a proactive manner to minimize our cash operating costs;
pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of our development, selling and administrative activities and, where
appropriate, taking advantage of opportunities to enhance our business growth and strategy.
Variability of Revenues
and Results of Operations
A significant portion of
our revenue is concentrated with several large customers, some of which are the same and some of which change over time. Orders from some
of these customers can be highly variable, with short lead times, which can cause our quarterly revenues, and consequently our results
of operations, to vary over a relatively short period of time.
Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates
We discussed the material
accounting policies that are critical in making the estimates and judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”.
There has been no material change in critical accounting policies or estimates during the period covered by this report.

The discussion that follows
below provides further details about our results of operations for the 2023 Quarter as compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Net revenues declined in
the OEM and retail distribution segments, but these declines were partially offset by higher revenues in the design segment.
Our gross profit decreased
across all segments and our gross margin declined from 22.6% in the 2022 Quarter to 17.8% in the 2023 Quarter, driven by continued pricing
pressures from our customers, higher importation and logistics costs and inflation. Management believes there will be continued volatility
in OEM and retail distribution cost of sales for the remainder of Fiscal 2023.
Sales and marketing expenses
decreased in the 2023 Quarter primarily due to a decrease in advertising costs and sales commissions in the OEM and retail distributions
segments, partially offset by higher sales related expenses in our design segment. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues remained
flat at 6.4% in the 2023 Quarter. If revenues from the retail segment grow to comprise a larger portion of the overall business, management
expects sales and marketing costs, both in total and as a percentage of revenues, to increase in future periods.
General and administrative
expenses increased in the 2023 Quarter, primarily related to increases in corporate expenses, which were partially offset by declines
in design segment expenses. These increase in corporate expenses were primarily driven by higher payroll costs and professional fees,
partially offset by lower equity compensation for non-employee board members. Management continues to monitor the various components of
general and administrative expenses and how these costs are affected by inflationary and other factors. We intend to adjust these costs
as needed based on the overall needs of the business.
We recorded net other income
of $37,000 in the 2023 Quarter compared to net other expense of $34,000 in the 2022 Quarter. The variance is due to fair value adjustments
of $40,000 in the 2023 Quarter to reduce to the fair value of the earnout consideration related to the Kablooe acquisition, $18,000 of
net duty drawback income received in the 2023 Quarter, foreign currency fluctuations and a decrease in interest expense resulting from
a reduction in the amount of debt outstanding.
We generated a net loss of
$430,000 and net income of $180,000 in the 2023 Quarter and 2022 Quarter, respectively. We maintain significant net operating loss carryforwards
and do not recognize a significant income tax expense or benefit as our deferred tax provision is typically offset by a full valuation
allowance on our net deferred tax asset.
Consolidated basic and diluted
(loss)/earnings per share were $(0.04) and $0.02 for the 2023 Quarter and the 2022 Quarter, respectively.

OEM Distribution Segment
Net revenues in the OEM distribution
segment decreased from lower sales volume from both diabetic customers as well as other OEM customers. As consumer demand increases for
diabetic testing products which require no carrying case, we expect diabetic product sales to continue to represent a smaller portion
of our OEM distribution revenue. In March 2023, a contract with one of our major diabetic customers will expire. Due to increased pricing
pressures, we will not be extending our contract with this customer. Revenue from this customer represented 12% of our consolidated net
revenues in both the 2023 Quarter and the 2022 Quarter. We expect the loss of this customer to cause a significant decline in OEM distribution
segment revenues in future periods.
The following tables set

Diabetic Product Revenues
Our OEM distribution segment
manufactures to the order of, and sells carrying cases for, blood glucose diagnostic kits directly to OEMs (or their contract manufacturers).
The OEM customer or its contract manufacturer packages our carry cases “in box” as a custom accessory for the OEM’s
blood glucose testing and monitoring kits, or to a lesser extent, sells them through their retail distribution channels.
Revenues from diabetic products
decreased due to lower volumes in the 2023 Quarter related to timing of orders relative to our fiscal quarters and the loss of one product
to a competitor. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in demand from another customer, which was also timing related.
As mentioned above, management believes that revenues from diabetic customers will decline in future periods. Revenues from diabetic products
represented 91% of net revenues for the OEM distribution segment in the 2023 Quarter compared to 81% in the 2022 Quarter.
Other Product Revenues
Our OEM distribution segment
also sources and sells cases and protective solutions for a diverse array of portable electronic and non-electronic products (such as
sporting and recreational products, bar code scanners, GPS devices, tablets and firearms) on a made-to-order basis that are customized
to fit the products sold by our OEM customers.
Revenues from other products
decreased due to lower sales volume with several existing customers, partially driven by the delayed rollout of certain customer product
lines and reduced demand from some customers. We will continue to focus on our sales and sales support teams in our continued efforts
to expand and diversify our other products customer base.
21
Operating Income
Operating income for the
OEM distribution segment decreased and operating income margin decreased from 9.5% in the 2022 Quarter to 2.6% in the 2023 Quarter, driven
by lower gross margins due to lower revenues and a shift in the mix of revenue in each period. While revenues decreased in both diabetic
and other products, a higher portion of revenue in the 2023 Quarter was generated from sales to diabetic customers, which yield a lower
gross margin, while a lower portion of revenue was generated from other OEM customers, which yield a higher gross margin. The cost of
importing all products from China has increased and both the diabetic and other OEM product lines have experienced pricing pressures from
customers.
Considering the loss of a
significant diabetic customer and expected performance in the OEM and retail distribution segments, the Company is currently assessing
the terms of its sourcing agreement with Forward China, which is scheduled to expire on October 22, 2023 (See Note 8 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements). The Company and Forward China have agreed to begin negotiations on a new sourcing agreement early
in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023.  While we believe a new agreement will be reached, we cannot provide any assurances that we
will be successful.  If an agreement cannot be reached, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s operations,
we will look at other alternatives for our OEM and retail distribution businesses prior to the expiration of the agreement.
Retail Distribution Segment
Net revenues decreased in
the 2023 Quarter primarily due to a reduction in sales volume with one existing retailer, which was partially offset by new business and
higher sales volumes from other retailers. As the cost of products increases and inflation continues to reduce consumer spending, profitability
becomes more challenging in the retail segment. We plan to focus our sales and sales support teams on efforts to match our product offerings
with consumer demand, sell off slow-moving inventory to reduce storage and other inventory holding costs, strategically increase the volume
of revenue from more profitable products and expand these product offerings through additional retailer websites.
The rising cost of freight,
storage and other logistics services outpaced revenue leading to a decline in gross margin from the 2022 Quarter to the 2023 Quarter.
This was partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses driven by lower sales commissions resulting from the decrease in revenue.
The operating loss margin increased from 16.4% in the 2022 Quarter to 30.8% in the 2023 Quarter. Management continues to evaluate plans
to reduce costs in efforts to improve operating results in the retail distribution segment.
Design Segment
The increase in net revenues
in the design segment was driven by an increase in projects from new and existing customers, which was partially offset by declines in
revenues from certain prior year customers.
Operating income for the
design segment decreased and operating income margin decreased from 11.7% in the 2022 Quarter to 8.1% in 2023 Quarter. The impact of higher
direct labor costs driven by inflationary pressures, coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, was slightly offset by better utilization
and increased billing rates.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary source of liquidity
is our operations. The primary demand on our working capital has historically been (i) operating losses, (ii) repayment of debt obligations,
and (iii) any increases in accounts receivable and inventories arising in the ordinary course of business. Historically, our sources of
liquidity have been adequate to satisfy working capital requirements arising in the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2022,
our working capital was $3,919,000 compared to $4,359,000 at September 30, 2022, the decrease primarily due to higher payables, partially
offset by higher accounts receivable balances. At January 31, 2023, we had approximately $2,100,000 cash on hand and $1,300,000 available
under our line of credit with a bank which matures May 31, 2023. As this line of credit has been renewed on multiple prior occasions,
management expects it will be renewed again. Considering the loss of a significant OEM distribution segment customer (see Note 5 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements) and the retail distribution segment operating losses, management is planning to evaluate
the Company’s cost structure and implement cost cutting initiatives as deemed necessary.
22
Forward China, our largest
vendor and an entity owned by our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, holds a $1,600,000 promissory note (the “FC
Note”) issued by us which matures on December 31, 2024 (see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). The balance
of the FC Note was reduced to $1,350,000 after we made principal payments of $250,000 through December 31, 2022. Although the FC Note
has been extended on multiple occasions to assist us with our liquidity position, we plan on funding the repayment at maturity using existing
cash balances and/or obtaining an additional credit facility as deemed necessary. Additionally, Forward China has extended payment terms
on our outstanding payables due to them when necessary. We can provide no assurance that (i) Forward China will extend the FC Note again
if we request an extension, (ii) Forward China will continue to extend payment terms on outstanding payables when we need them, or (iii)
any additional credit facility will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
We anticipate that our liquidity
and financial resources for the 12 months following the date of this report will be adequate to manage our operating and financial requirements.
If we have the opportunity to make a strategic acquisition (as we have in the past with the acquisitions of IPS and Kablooe) or an investment
in a product or partnership, we may require additional capital beyond our current cash balance to fund the opportunity. If we seek to
raise additional capital, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In the
current environment of rising interest rates, any future borrowing is expected to result in higher interest expense.
Although we do not anticipate
the need to purchase additional material capital assets in order to carry out our business, it may be necessary for us to purchase equipment
and other capital assets in the future, depending on need.
Cash Flows
During the 2023 Quarter and
2022 Quarter, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:
Operating
Activities
During the 2023 Quarter,
cash used in operating activities of $149,000 resulted from a net loss of $430,000, an increase in accounts receivable of $994,000, an
increase in inventories of $338,000, a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $459,000 and the net change in other
operating assets and liabilities of $73,000, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and amounts due to Forward China of $2,070,000
and non-cash expenses of $75,000 related to fair value adjustments, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and bad debt
expense.
During the 2022 Quarter,
cash provided by operating activities of $1,138,000 primarily resulted from net income of $180,000, an increase in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and amounts due to Forward China of $1,276,000, an increase in deferred income of $565,000 and non-cash expenses of $112,000
for depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in inventories of $910,000 and the net change
in other operating assets and liabilities of $85,000.

in the 2023 Quarter and the 2022 Quarter of $45,000 and $66,000, respectively, resulted from purchases of property and equipment.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures . Our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, required by Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on their evaluation, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations of the Effectiveness
of Controls and Procedures . A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.
