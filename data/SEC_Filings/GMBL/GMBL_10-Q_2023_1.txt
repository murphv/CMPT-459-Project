Nature of Operations
Esports
Entertainment Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “EEG”) was formed in the state of Nevada on July 22, 2008 under the
name Virtual Closet, Inc., before changing its name to DK Sinopharma, Inc. on June 6, 2010 and then to, VGambling, Inc. on August 12,
2014. On or about April 24, 2017, VGambling, Inc. changed its name to Esports Entertainment Group, Inc.
The
Company is a diversified operator of iGaming, traditional sports betting and esports businesses with a global footprint. The
Company’s strategy is to build and acquire iGaming and traditional sports betting platforms and use them to grow the esports
business whereby customers have access to game centers, online tournaments and player-versus-player wagering. On July 31, 2020, the
Company commenced revenue generating operations with the acquisition of LHE Enterprises Limited, a holding company for Argyll
Entertainment (“Argyll”), an online sportsbook and casino operator. On January 21, 2021, the Company completed its
acquisition of Phoenix Games Network Limited, the holding company for the Esports Gaming League (“EGL”), and provider of
event management and team services, including live and online events and tournaments. On March 1, 2021, the Company completed the
acquisition of the operating assets and specified liabilities that comprise the online gaming operations of Lucky Dino Gaming
Limited, a company registered in Malta, and Hiidenkivi Estonia OU, its wholly owned subsidiary registered in Estonia (collectively
referred to as “Lucky Dino”). On June 1, 2021, the Company acquired ggCircuit, LLC (“GGC”) and Helix
Holdings, LLC (“Helix”). GGC is a business-to-business software company that provides cloud-based management for gaming
centers, a tournament platform and integrated wallet and point-of-sale solutions. Helix owned and operated esports centers that were
disposed of on June 10, 2022, as the Company exited the physical sites. From the Helix acquisition, the Company retained its core
esports programming and gaming infrastructure and remains focused on its core esports offerings. On July 13, 2021, the Company
completed its acquisition of Bethard Group Limited the online casino and sports book business operating under the brand of Bethard
(“Bethard”). Bethard’s business-to-consumer operations provides sportsbook, casino, live casino and fantasy sport
betting services. On February 14, 2023, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to sell the Bethard business and it
is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (Note 19).

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of presentation and principles of consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the
rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) set forth in Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read along with the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K of the Company for the annual
period ended June 30, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reportable
Segments
The
Company operates two complementary business segments:
EEG
iGaming
EEG
iGaming includes the Company’s iGaming casino and sportsbook product offerings. Currently, the Company operates the business to
consumer segment primarily in Europe.
7
EEG
Games
EEG
Games’ focus is on providing esports entertainment experiences to gamers through a combination of: (1) our proprietary infrastructure
software, GGC, which underpins our focus on esports and is a leading provider of local area network (“LAN”) center management
software and services, enabling us to seamlessly manage mission critical functions such as game licensing and payments, (2) online tournaments
(through our EGL tournament platform), and (3) player-vs-player wagering. Currently, we operate our esports EEG Games business in the
United States and Europe.
These
segments consider the organizational structure of the Company and the nature of financial information available and reviewed by the chief
operating decision maker to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocations.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates include the valuation and accounting for equity awards related to warrants and stock-based compensation, determination
of fair value for derivative instruments, the valuation and recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, the accounting for business
combinations, including estimating contingent consideration and allocating purchase price, estimating fair value of intangible assets,
as well as the estimates related to accruals and contingencies.
Liquidity
and Going Concern
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue
as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date
these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business.
The
Company has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a least one
year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. One such factor
considered by the Company is its compliance with certain debt covenants under terms of the Senior Convertible Note (the “Senior
Convertible Note”), issued by the Company on February 22, 2022 in the principal amount of $ 35,000,000
with a December 31, 2022 outstanding carrying
value of $ 32,221,573 .
The Company has not maintained compliance with certain debt covenants and is currently in default under the terms of the Senior Convertible
Note. The Company repaid principal of $ 2,778,427
during the six months ended December 31, 2022,
using proceeds from the September 2022 equity financing (“September 2022 Offering”). Subsequent to December 31, 2022 and
through February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, the Company has converted $ 18,861,575
of the Senior Convertible Note through the issuance
of
217,159,442
shares of common stock (Note 19). In addition,
on February 14, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) for the sale of the Bethard business (Note
19). On February 16, 2023, as a condition to the closing of the sale of the Bethard business, the Company entered into an Amendment and
Waiver Agreement (the “Amendment”) with the of the Senior Convertible Note holder (the “Holder”) (Note 19).
After
including the impact of the conversions reducing the debt by $ 18,861,573  and the Amendment increasing the debt by $ 2,950,000 ,
for fees of $ 450,000
and converted accrued liabilities of $ 2,500,000 , on February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, the Company has reduced
its outstanding debt on the Senior Convertible Note to
$ 16,310,000 .
The Company will continue to convert to further reduce this debt. The maturity date of the Senior Convertible Note is
June
2, 2023 . The Senior Convertible Note is classified
as a current liability on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and due to the default it may be redeemed by the Holder
prior to its maturity date. The Company has also recorded a derivative liability for the alternate conversion in the Senior Convertible
Note of $ 799,954
in current liabilities on the unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet that may be due to the Holder as part of the make-whole liability under the default terms of the Senior Convertible
Note. The cash liability calculated under the terms of the Senior Convertible Note of approximately $ 933,000,000 ,
is materially higher than the fair value of the derivative liability of $ 799,954
calculated at December 31, 2022. The calculated
make-whole liability may differ materially from the amount at which the Company may be required to pay under the Senior Convertible Note.
In
addition to the conversions discussed above, the Company is in discussions with the Holder to restructure its payment obligations,
including but not limited to eliminating the derivative liability on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and
addressing the Company’s default status under the debt.
In
connection with the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, which includes actions to be taken to
meet the minimum market value of listed securities or minimum stockholders’ equity, the Company may issue a perpetual
convertible preferred stock by March 31, 2023, to cover the remaining principal balance due under the Senior Convertible Note at the
time of entering the issuance.
Although
the Company and the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note are in discussions to determine the terms of the perpetual convertible
preferred stock, such terms have not been finalized and there is no assurance that the Company and the Holder will come to an
agreement on such terms. The ability of the Holder of the perpetual convertible preferred stock to convert such preferred stock into
shares of our common stock was approved in the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders held on January 26, 2023. The Company will
disclose the material terms of the perpetual convertible preferred stock in connection with the completion of the exchange
transaction, including the filing of a certificate of designation with the State of Nevada to designate the terms of such preferred
stock after the issuance of the stock. In addition, as part of the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and as approved in
the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company intends to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The Board has approved
the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-one-hundred (1 for
100 ), without a corresponding reduction in the total
number of authorized shares of common stock. Further, during the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders the Company obtained
stockholder approval for the issuance of such shares of Common Stock to the Holder that would exceed
19.99 %
of
the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the Senior Convertible
Note, and the potential effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In
addition to compliance with debt covenants, the Company considered that it had an accumulated deficit of $ 167,441,699
as of December 31, 2022 and that it has had a history of recurring losses from operations and recurring negative cash flows from
operations as it has prepared to grow its esports business through acquisition and new venture opportunities. At December 31, 2022,
the Company had total current assets of $ 7,871,822
and total current liabilities of $ 54,870,414 .
Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 8,540,978
which includes a net loss of $ 18,301,273 .
The Company also considered its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be deemed outside the
control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
$ 682,378
of available cash on-hand and net current liabilities of $ 46,998,592 .
In addition to the Senior Convertible Note conversions that are reducing the debt outstanding, on December 21, 2022, the Company
closed an offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) in which it sold: (a)
7,065,000
shares of Common Stock to the Holder and (b) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to
17,850,000
at a price of $ 0.0937
per warrant, directly to the Holder, with all but $ 0.001
per warrant prepaid to the Company at the closing. The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of Common Stock and
pre-funded warrants before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company was $ 2,316,686 .
The Company remitted approximately $ 1,073,343
to the Holder to be applied to accrued interest and future interest payments under the Senior Convertible Note. The net proceeds
received by the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company and
amounts remitted to the Holder was $ 1,073,343 .
On September 19, 2022 the Company closed the September 2022 Offering in which it sold: (a)
30,000,000
shares of Common Stock and (b) warrants to purchase up to
30,000,000
shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $ 0.25
per share (the “September 2022 Offering Warrants”), at an aggregate price of $ 0.25
per share and accompanying September 2022 Offering Warrant. The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of Common Stock and
Warrants before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company was $ 7,500,000 .
On the issuance date, the Company also granted an overallotment to the underwriters of the offering for
3,600,000
overallotment warrants (“September 2022 Overallotment Warrants”), at a purchase price of $ 0.01
per warrant, with an exercise price of $ 0.25
per warrant (the September 2022 Offering Warrants and September 2022 Overallotment Warrants are collectively referred to as the
“September 2022 Warrants”). Total proceeds from the September 2022 Overallotment Warrants were $ 36,000 .
The Company remitted to the Holder an amount of $ 2,265,927
equal to fifty percent ( 50 %)
of all net proceeds above $ 2,000,000
following the payment of
7 %
in offering fees including underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, as part of the September 2022 Offering, the Holder
purchased $ 512,500
of securities ( 2,050,000
shares of Common Stock and
2,050,000
September 2022 Warrants) and the Company paid the Holder an additional $ 512,500 .
The proceeds remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note reduced the principal balance of the Senior Convertible Note on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. The net proceeds received by the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses payable by the Company and amounts remitted to the Holder was $ 4,075,991 .
On March 2, 2022 the Company closed an offering (the “March 2022 Offering”) in which it sold
15,000,000
units at $ 1.00
consisting of one share of Common Stock and one warrant for a total of
15,000,000
warrants with an exercise price of $ 1.00
(the “March 2022 Offering Warrants”). There was also an overallotment option exercised to purchase warrants to purchase
an additional
2,250,000
shares of common stock (the “April 2022 Overallotment Warrants”) with an exercise price of $ 1.00
issued to the underwriters of the offering on April 1, 2022 (the March 2022 Offering Warrants and the April 2022 Overallotment
Warrants are collectively referred to as the “March 2022 Warrants”). The March 2022 Offering provided net cash proceeds
of $ 13,605,000 .
The
amount of available cash on hand on February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, was $ 951,153 .
The
Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund its operations and obligations without
additional financing. Although the Company has financing available, as further described below, the ability to raise financing using
these sources is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, performance, and investor sentiment as it relates
to the Company and the esports and iGaming industry. The combination of these conditions was determined to raise substantial doubt regarding
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
determining whether the Company can overcome the presumption of substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, the
Company may consider the effects of any mitigating plans for additional sources of financing. The Company identified additional financing
sources it believes, depending on market conditions, may be available to fund its operations and drive future growth, which include (i)
the potential expected proceeds from the recently filed S-1 where the amount of the offering has not yet been determined , (ii)
the potential proceeds from the exercise of the
33,600,000
September 2022 Warrants, exercisable at $ 0.25 ,
outstanding at December 31, 2022, (iii) the potential proceeds from the exercise of the
17,250,000
March 2022 Warrants, exercisable at $ 1.00 ,
outstanding at December 31, 2022, (iv) the ability to sell shares of Common Stock of the Company through various forms of offerings,
and (v) the ability to raise additional financing from other sources. The Company is also continuing discussions with the Holder to restructure
the payment terms and debt covenants.
These
above plans are likely to require the Company to place reliance on several factors, including favorable market conditions, to access
additional capital in the future. These plans were therefore determined not to be sufficient to overcome the presumption of substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do
not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
COVID-19
The
novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) emerged in December 2019 and has since adversely impacted global commercial activity, disrupted
supply chains and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets.
The
Company has previously indicated that a significant or prolonged decrease in consumer spending on entertainment or leisure activities
may have an adverse effect on demand for the Company’s product offerings, including in-person access to game centers and tournaments,
reducing cash flows and revenues, and thereby materially harming the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
9
The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other areas of the business will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and may
result in an extended period of continued business disruption and reduced operations. A materially disruptive resurgence of COVID-19
cases or the emergence of additional variants or strains of COVID-19 could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on
where infection rates are highest. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor developments
relating to disruptions and uncertainties caused by COVID-19.
Nasdaq
Continued Listing Rules or Standards
On April 11, 2022, the Company received a deficiency
notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company
was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price for the Company’s Common Stock had closed below
$1.00 per share for the previous thirty consecutive business days.
On June 7, 2022, the Company received a further letter
from Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company’s minimum Market Value of Listed Securities
(“MVLS”) was below the minimum of $ 35,000,000
required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2).
On October 11, 2022, the Company received a third
letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company’s Common Stock will be delisted, and the Company’s Common Stock
warrants traded under the symbols GMBLW and GMBLZ and the Company’s 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock
traded under symbol GMBLP will no longer qualify for listing, and in that regard trading of the Company’s Common Stock, Common Stock
warrants and 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock will be suspended. The Company requested an appeal with the
Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) and the hearing was held on November 17, 2022.
On November 30, 2022, the Company received a determination
from the Panel granting the Company’s request for the continued listing of its common stock on the Capital Market tier of Nasdaq,
subject to the Company evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price, and the $ 2,500,000
stockholders’ equity requirement,
as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1), respectively, on or before February 7, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively,
and adhering to certain other conditions and requirements described below.
On December 6, 2022, the Company received a fourth
letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) requiring the Company to maintain
a MVLS at a minimum of $ 35,000,000 . This was addressed in the November 17, 2022, hearing before the Panel where the Company presented
on its plan to comply with the Rule 5550(b)(2) or alternative criteria and was granted continued listing subject to the criteria noted
above.
10
From the initial determination, the Company has completed conditions 1
and 2:
1.
On or before January 13, 2023, the Company shall file a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC for a $ 10
million public offering;
2.
On January 26, 2023, the Company shall obtain stockholder approval for a reverse stock split at a ratio that is sufficient to ensure compliance with the Bid Price Rule;
On January 13, 2023, the Company filed its S-1, subject
to amendments, and on January 26, 2023, as part of the 2022 annual meeting, the Company obtained stockholder approval for the of the Common
Stock at a ratio of not less than one-for-twenty (1-for-20) and not more than one-for-one-hundred (1-for-100). The Board has approved the
reverse split at a ratio of one-for-one-hundred (1 for 100), without a corresponding reduction in the total number of authorized shares
of Common Stock, and to be in effect no later than February 22, 2023 to meet the minimum bid price compliance milestone.
On February 8, 2023 the Company received notice from
the Panel updating its remaining conditions as follows:
1.
On February 20, 2023, the Company shall provide a written update to the Panel regarding the progress of its debt-to-equity conversion plan and its impact on the Company’s equity;
2.
On March 7, 2023, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid price of $ 1.00
or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions; and
3.
On March 31, 2023, the Company shall demonstrate compliance with the shareholder equity requirement, as outlined in Equity Rule.
The Company is working towards meeting all other conditions
related to regaining compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules including the conversion of the Senior Convertible Note.
Additionally, the Panel reserved the right to reconsider
the terms of this exception. As a result, any failure to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq
could result in delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq and negatively impact our company and holders of our common stock, including
by reducing the willingness of investors to hold our common stock because of the resulting decreased price, liquidity and trading of our
common stock, limited availability of price quotations and reduced news and analyst coverage. Delisting may adversely impact the perception
of our financial condition, cause reputational harm with investors, our employees and parties conducting business with us and limit our
access to debt and equity financing.
As discussed above, the Company is in the process
of taking definitive steps to comply with all applicable conditions and criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. There can be no assurances,
however, that the Company will be able to do so. The Company must satisfy the time frame granted by the Panel or Nasdaq will provide written
notification that its securities will be delisted. As part of the compliance plan the Company is negotiating with the Holder to restructure the Senior Convertible Note, including the derivative liability.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
includes cash on hand. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company did not have any financial instruments classified as cash equivalents.
At times, cash deposits inclusive of restricted cash may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limits.
Accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $ 250,000
per financial institution. There have been no losses recognized on cash balances held
at these financial institutions.
Restricted
Cash
Restricted
cash includes cash reserves maintained for compliance with gaming regulations that require adequate liquidity to satisfy the Company’s
liabilities to customers.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable is comprised of the amounts billed to customers principally for esports events and team management services. Accounts receivable
is recorded net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations for its customers and determines the
amount of the allowance for credit losses upon considering such factors as historical losses, known disputes or collectability issues,
the age of a receivable balance as well as current economic conditions. Bad debt expense is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit
losses at an appropriate level and changes in the allowance for credit losses are included in general and administrative expense in the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was
not material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Receivables
Reserved for Users
User
deposit receivables are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect from a payment processor. A user initiates a deposit with
a payment processor, and the payment processor remits the deposit to the Company. The amount due from the payment processor is recorded
as a receivable reserved for users on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. An allowance for doubtful accounts may be
established if it is determined that the Company is unable to collect a receivable from a payment processor. An increase to the allowance
for doubtful accounts is recognized as a loss within general and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is not material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
11
Equipment
Equipment
is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes the direct cost of equipment as well as expenditures related
to improvements and betterments that add to the productive capacity or useful life of the equipment. Depreciation is computed utilizing
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease
term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. The estimated useful life of equipment by asset class follows:
Schedule
of Estimated Useful Life of Asset
Computer Equipment
Up to
5
years
Furniture and fixtures
Up to
7
years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated life
of the improvement
The
estimated useful life and residual value of equipment are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
The costs and accumulated depreciation of assets that are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and the
resulting gain or loss is recognized as a gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations.
Business
Combinations
The
Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company records the assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and acquisition-related contingent consideration at fair value on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase
price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company may adjust
the preliminary purchase price and purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the
acquisition closing date as it obtains more information as to facts and circumstances that impact the determination of fair value at
the acquisition date. Any change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition
date is recognized in earnings. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of fair value of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather it is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an
annual basis on April 1 for each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating
segment. In accordance with ASC Topic 350
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , as of December 31, 2022 the Company’s business
is classified into four reporting units: iGaming Malta (including Bethard and Lucky Dino), iGaming Argyll (UK), EGL, and GGC. The Helix
business was sold as of June 10, 2022 and was previously its own reporting unit.
In
testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to begin with a qualitative assessment, commonly referred to as “Step
0,” to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its
carrying value. This qualitative assessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry
and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in the Company’s
management, strategy and primary user base. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying value, the Company then performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the carrying
amount to the fair value of the reporting unit. If it is determined that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the excess
of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss in accordance with Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-04,
Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment . The
Company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and uses internal and market multiples, to assess
reasonableness of assumptions, to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments
and assumptions including anticipated revenue growth rates, discount rates, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs
and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on the Company’s operating and capital forecasts.
As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in the income approach. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions
could result in a fair value that differs from the Company’s estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment
charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, the Company also considers the combined fair values of the Company’s
reporting units to a reasonable market capitalization of the Company. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment
for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company’s initiated a process to evaluate the strategic options for the EEG iGaming business, including exploring a sale
of EEG iGaming assets due to increasing regulatory burdens and competition. In December 2022, the Company closed down its licensed
remote gambling operation in the UK market and on December 9, 2022 surrendered its UK license, as part of the winding down of the
Argyll UK iGaming operations. Subsequent to the period end, the Company appointed a new CEO and a new interim CFO and on January 18,
2023 sold its EEG iGaming Spanish license. As part of these changes the Company has been focused on reducing costs in its businesses
as it has seen the EEG iGaming revenues decline significantly from levels seen in the previous year and previous quarters. This and
uncertainties caused by inflation and world stability were determined to be a triggering event and the long-lived assets of the
Company were quantitatively tested for impairment. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized
total goodwill asset impairment charges of $ 16,135,000
in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, with asset impairment charges to the goodwill to the iGaming
reporting unit of $ 14,500,000 ,
which is part of the EEG iGaming segment, and to the goodwill of the GGC reporting unit of $ 1,635,000 ,
which is part of the EEG Games segment (see Note 6 for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment, and the effects on
the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations). Further downturns in economic, regulatory and
operating conditions could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. There were no goodwill asset impairment
charges recorded during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.
Intangible
assets
Intangible
assets with determinable lives consist of player relationships, developed technology and software, tradenames and gaming licenses. Intangible
assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
5 years
for player relationships
and developed technology and software,
10 years
for tradenames and
2 years
for gaming licenses. The Company also capitalizes internal-use
software costs such as external consulting fees, payroll and payroll-related costs and stock-based compensation for employees in the
Company’s development and information technology groups who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the Company’s
internal-use software projects. Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete and the Company commits resources to the software
project and continues during the application development stage. Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is ready
for its intended use. Costs incurred during the planning, training and post-implementation stages of the software development life cycle
are expensed as incurred.
12
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
Equipment
and other long-lived assets, including finite lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment periodically or when events and circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, an estimate of future undiscounted
cash flows are determined through estimated disposition date of the asset. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash
flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the
carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. An estimation of future cash flows
requires significant judgment as the Company makes assumptions about future results and market conditions. Since the determination of
future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be impairments recognized in future periods in the event future cash
flows do not meet expectations.
During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that there was no impairment on its long-lived assets.
Liabilities
to Customers
The
Company records liabilities to customers, also referred to as player liabilities, for the amounts that may be withdrawn by a player at
a given time. The player liabilities include player deposits, bonuses or incentive awards and user winnings less withdrawals, tax withholdings
and player losses. The Company maintains a restricted cash balance and player deposits held by third parties, recorded as receivables
reserved for users on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, at levels equal to or exceeding its liabilities to customers.
Jackpot
Provision
The
jackpot provision liability is an estimate of the amount due to players for jackpot winnings. The jackpot liability is accrued monthly
based on an estimate of the jackpot amount available for winning. The jackpot increases with each bet on a jackpot eligible iGaming casino
machine and a portion of each losing bet is allocated towards the funding of the jackpot amount. Jackpots are programmed to be paid out
randomly across certain casino brands. When a player wins a jackpot, the amount of the jackpot is reset to a defined amount that varies
across eligible iGaming casino machines. Participating iGaming casino machines of the Company pool into the same jackpot and therefore
the winning of a jackpot affects other players on the network of participating iGaming casino machines. Jackpot winnings reduce revenue
at the time the entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot, which occurs when the jackpot is won by the player.
Leases
The
Company leases office space through operating lease agreements that were a result of its acquisitions of Argyll and Lucky Dino. The Company
previously leased game center space, other property and equipment, acquired through the Helix acquisition, that was sold as part of the
Helix sale transaction on June 10, 2022, where the purchaser assumed the lease liabilities. The Company measures an operating lease right-of-use
(“ROU”) asset and liability, as well as a finance lease asset and liability, based on the present value of the future minimum
lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Minimum lease payments include the fixed lease and non-lease components
of the agreement, as well as any variable rent payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement
date.
The
minimum payments under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. Operating lease expenses related to variable lease payments are recognized as operating expenses in a manner
consistent with the nature of the underlying lease and as the events, activities, or circumstances in the lease agreement occur. Leases
with a term of less than 12 months (“short-term leases”) are not recognized on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets. The rent expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and
administrative expense on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
13
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between U.S.
GAAP treatment and tax treatment of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses
the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the
weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized,
a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated
by considering taxable income in carryback years, existing taxable temporary differences, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies
and estimated future taxable profits.
The
Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements by applying
a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the
likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not
to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized
tax benefits, that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Derivative
Instruments
The
Company evaluates its convertible notes, equity instruments and warrants, to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those
contracts qualify as derivatives (Note 11). The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative
is recorded at fair value each reporting period and recorded as a liability (Note 17) in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations as other income or expense (Note 17).
In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to a liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current to correspond with its host instrument. The Company records the fair value
of the remaining embedded derivative at each balance sheet date and records the change in the fair value of the remaining embedded derivative
as other income or expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Fair
Value Measurements
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous
market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The
following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value, of which the first two are considered observable and
the third is considered unobservable:
Level 1:
Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
Observable inputs other
than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs that
are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
14
Certain
assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company adjusts contingent consideration resulting
from a business combination, derivative financial instruments and warrant liabilities, to fair value on a recurring basis. Certain long-lived
assets may be periodically required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including long-lived assets that are impaired.
The fair values for other assets and liabilities such as cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, receivables reserved for users,
other receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and liabilities to customers have
been determined to approximate their carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair values of the Senior
Convertible Note and lease liabilities approximate their carrying value based on current interest and discount rates.
Earnings
Per Share
Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, basic income (loss) is computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding
the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share,
except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential
common shares had been issued if such additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of
potential common shares, such as the Company’s preferred stock, notes, warrants and stock options, to the extent the effect is
dilutive. As the Company had net losses for all the periods presented, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, and additional
potential common shares have been excluded, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
The
following securities were excluded from weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the three and six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 because their inclusion would have been antidilutive:

Comprehensive
Loss
Comprehensive
loss consists of the net loss for the year and foreign currency translation adjustments related to the effect of foreign exchange on
the value of assets and liabilities. The net translation loss for the year is included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of comprehensive loss.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company periodically issues stock-based compensation to employees, directors, contractors and consultants for services rendered. Stock-based
compensation granted to employees and non-employee directors includes grants of restricted stock and employee stock options that are
measured and recognized based on their fair values determined on the grant date. The award of restricted stock and stock options, which
are generally time vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period. The fair value of stock options is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is affected by several
variables, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of the equity award, the exercise price
of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the Common
Stock over the term of the equity award. The fair value of restricted stock is determined by the closing market price of the Company’s
Common Stock on the date of grant. The compensation cost for service-based stock options granted to consultants is measured at the grant
date, based on the fair value of the award, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (the vesting period
of the award).

Revenue
and Cost Recognition
The
revenue of the Company is currently generated from online casino and sports betting (referred to herein as “EEG iGaming revenue”),
and esports revenue (referred to herein as “EEG Games Revenue”), consisting of the sales of subscriptions to access cloud-based
software used by independent operators of game centers, from consulting and data analytic services provided to game operators (“EEG
Games Esports and Other Revenue”), and from the provision of esports event and team management services (“EEG Games Esports
Event Management and Team Service Revenue”). The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 606 –
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”) when control of a product
or service is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue is measured at the transaction price, or the amount of consideration that
the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring a promised good or service. The transaction price includes estimates of variable
consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur.
Revenue
generating activities of the Company may be subject to value added tax (“VAT”) in certain jurisdictions in which the Company
operates. Revenue is presented net of VAT in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. VAT receivables and VAT payables
are included in other receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets. Sales to customers do not have significant financing components or payment terms greater than 12 months.
EEG
iGaming Revenue
EEG
iGaming revenue is derived from the placement of bets by end-users, also referred to as customers, through online gaming sites. The transaction
price in an iGaming contract, or Net Gaming Revenue (“NGR”), is the difference between gaming wins and losses, as further
reduced by any nondiscretionary incentives awarded to the customer. Gaming transactions involve four performance obligations, namely
the settlement of each individual bet, the honoring of discretionary incentives available to the customer through loyalty reward programs,
the award of free spin and deposit match bonuses, and the winning of a casino jackpot. The total amount wagered by a customer is commonly
referred to as the win or Gross Gaming Revenue (“GGR”). The GGR is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative
standalone selling price (“SSP”) determined for iGaming contracts.
Revenue
recognition for individual wagers is recognized when the gaming occurs, as such gaming activities are settled immediately. The revenue
allocated to incentives, such as loyalty points offered through a rewards program, is deferred and recognized as revenue when the loyalty
points are redeemed. Revenue allocated to free spins and deposit matches, referred to as bonuses, are recognized at the time that they
are wagered. The revenue for jackpot games is recognized when the jackpot is won by the customer. The Company applies a practical expedient
by accounting for its performance obligations on a portfolio basis as iGaming contracts have similar characteristics. The Company expects
the application of the revenue recognition guidance to a portfolio of iGaming contracts will not materially differ from the application
of the revenue recognition guidance on an individual contract basis.
The
Company evaluates bets that its users place on websites owned by third party brands in order to determine whether it may recognize revenue
on a gross basis, when acting as the principal provider of the wagering service, or on a net basis, when acting as an intermediary or
agent. The principal in a wagering service involving a third party is generally the entity that controls the wagering service such that
it has a right to the services being performed by the third party and can direct the third party in delivery of the service to its users.
The Company records revenue on a gross basis as it has determined it is the principal in transactions involving third parties, such as
revenue sharing arrangements, as it controls the wagering service being offered to the users such that it has a right to the service
performed by third parties and can further direct third parties in providing services to users. The Company further records expenses
related to its revenue sharing arrangements and other third-party iGaming expenses within costs of revenue in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations.
16
EEG
Games Revenue
EEG
Games Esports and Other Revenue
The
Company derives revenue from sales of subscriptions to access cloud-based software used by independent operators of game centers, as
well as from consulting and data analytic services provided to game operators. The revenue derived from the sale of subscription services
to cloud-based software used by game centers is recognized over the term of the contract, which generally can range from one month to
one year in duration, beginning on the date the customer is provided access to the Company’s hosted software platform. The revenue
from the operation of game centers by the Company is recognized when a customer purchased time to use the esports gaming equipment at
each center. The revenue from time purchased by a customer and from the sale of concessions is recognized at the point of sale.
The
Company further provides consultation services related to the use of hardware and equipment for gaming operations together with implementation
services that include sourcing, training, planning, and installation of technology. The Company considers services related to hardware
and equipment, implementation, and any design of user interface for the customer as separate performance obligations. Revenue for hardware
equipment and design of custom user interface is recognized at a point in time upon delivery and completion. Implementation services
are recognized over time, as services are performed.
The
Company also has contracts with software companies to provide talent data analytics and related esports services, which include analytic
development, other related services to develop software and applications for tournaments, and to provide data support, data gathering,
gameplay analysis and reporting which includes talent analytics and related esports services, including analytic development, data analysis,
survey design, interview services, player dossiers, and expert services. The Company recognizes revenue from its data analytic services
over the life of the contract utilizing the output method, using a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the goods or services
transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contact. The Company elected to use the right to invoice
practical expedient and recognize revenue based on the amounts invoiced. The payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however,
the Company’s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date.
17
The
Company has partnership contracts with strategic customers within the esports industry. The partnership contracts are negotiated agreements,
which contain both licensing arrangements of intellectual property and development services, including fixed and variable components.
The variability of revenue is driven by development plans and results of sales as specified by the partnership contract, which are known
as of an invoice date. Partnership contracts generally do not have terms that extend beyond one year. The Company considers licensing
arrangements and development services as separate performance obligations. Licensing revenues are recorded over time. Revenue associated
with development is recognized over time, as labor is incurred.
Contracts
that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation
based on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely
to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company determines
standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is
not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account the Company’s
overall pricing objectives, considering market conditions and other factors, including the value of the deliverables in the contracts,
customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within the contracts.
EEG
Games Esports Event Management and Team Service Revenue
The
Company derives revenue from esports event management and team services. Esports event management services support the creation, production
and delivery of an esports event by providing event staffing, gaming consoles, and other technical goods and services for a customer
event that is either hosted live in person or online. The revenue generated from esports event management services is generally earned
on a fixed fee basis per event.
The
esports team services offerings of the Company include recruitment and management services offered to sports clubs to facilitate their
entrance into esports tournament competition. Team services provided to a customer may include player recruitment, administration of
player contracts, processing of tournament admission, providing logistical arrangements, as well as providing ongoing support to the
team during the event. Team services are earned on a fixed fee basis per tournament.
Esports
event management and team services revenues are recognized over the term of the event or the relevant contractual term for services as
this method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue for event management services based
on the number of days completed for the event relative to the total days of the event. Revenue from team management services is recognized
from inception of the contract through the end of the tournament using the number of days completed relative to the total number of days
in the contract term. Revenue collected in advance of the event management or team services is recorded as deferred revenue on the unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company may also enter into profit sharing arrangements which are determined based on the
net revenue earned by the customer for an event in addition to a fixed fee. Revenue recognition for profit sharing arrangements is recognized
at the time the revenue from the event is determined, which is generally at the conclusion of the event. An event or team services contract
may further require the Company to distribute payments to event or tournament attendees resulting in the recognition of a processing
fee by the Company. The Company does not recognize revenue from the processing of payments until the conclusion of the event or tournament.
The
Company evaluates the service being provided under an esports event and team services contract to determine whether it should recognize
revenue on a gross basis as the principal provider of the service, or on a net basis in a manner similar to that of an agent. The Company
has determined that for esports event and team services contracts that allow for the assignment of individual tasks to a third-party
contractor, the Company acts as the principal provider of the service being offered to the customer as it remains primarily responsible
for fulfilling the contractual promise to the customer. In profit sharing arrangements, such as events that allow for the Company to
share in the revenue earned by a customer for an event, the Company has determined it acts in the role of an agent to the customer as
the event creator. The Company has also determined it acts as an agent when it collects a processing fee for performing the service of
distributing prize money on behalf of its customers to event or tournament winners.
18
Contract
Liabilities
Liabilities
to customers include both player liabilities, consisting of a free spin bonus and a deposit match bonus, and the player reward liabilities.
The free spin bonus provides the user the opportunity to a free play, or otherwise spin, on an iGaming casino slot machine without withdrawing
a bet amount from the player’s account. The deposit match bonus matches a player’s deposit up to a certain specified percentage
or amount. These bonuses represent consideration payable to a customer and therefore are treated as a reduction of the transaction price
in determining NGR. The Company also offers non-discretionary loyalty rewards points to customers that can be redeemed for free play
or cash. The Company allocates revenue from wagers to loyalty points rewards earned by users, thereby deferring a portion of revenue
from users that participate in a loyalty reward program. The amount of revenue deferred related to loyalty points available to users
is based on the estimated fair value of the loyalty point incentive available to the user.
The
Company also records payments received in advance of performance under an esports gaming services contract or event management or team
services contract as deferred revenue.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40).
The standard clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding
equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity
should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains
equity classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. The guidance is effective
for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this standard as of July 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance
did not have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging –
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).
This standard eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion
accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own equity that
are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies how particular
convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. For public business
entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years using
the fully retrospective or modified retrospective method. The Company adopted this standard as of July 1, 2022. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and
contract liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 606. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and
early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and it does not expect the guidance to have a material effect on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.
19
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments . The amendments included in ASU 2016-13 require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held
at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Although the new
standard, known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, has a greater impact on financial institutions, most
other organizations with financial instruments or other assets (trade receivables, contract assets, lease receivables, financial guarantees,
loans and loan commitments, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities) are subject to the CECL model and will need to use forward-looking
information to better evaluate their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted,
although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends
the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU
2016-13 was originally effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In November of 2019, the FASB
issued ASU 2019-10,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic
842): Effective Dates , which delayed the implementation of ASU 2016-13 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including
interim periods within those fiscal years for smaller reporting companies. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption
of this guidance will have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the
specified effective date. The Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

Goodwill, balance as of December 31, 2022
$ 5,604,282
$ 979,832
$ 6,584,114
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed considering that the EEG iGaming revenues had declined
significantly from levels seen in the previous year and in the previous quarters. This and uncertainties caused by inflation and
world stability were determined to be a triggering event and the long-lived assets of the Company were quantitatively tested for
impairment.
The Company performed its interim impairment tests
on its long-lived assets, including its definite-lived intangible assets using an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary assets were sufficient
to recover the carrying value of the asset groups, which were determined to be at the business component level. Based on the circumstances
described above as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that all its asset groups we recoverable under the undiscounted cash
flow recoverability test. There were
no
asset impairment charges for long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
In accordance with ASC 350, for goodwill, the
Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test, which compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its
respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was derived primarily by utilizing a discounted cash
flows analysis. The results of the interim impairment tests performed indicated that the carrying value of the iGaming and GGC
reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values determined by the Company. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment
testing procedures, the Company recognized goodwill impairments of $ 14,500,000
for
the iGaming Malta reporting unit of the EEG iGaming segment, and goodwill of $ 1,635,000
for
the GGC reporting unit, in the EEG Games segment, totaling $ 16,135,000
for
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 in asset impairment charges in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations. There were
no
asset
impairment charges for goodwill or long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2021.
The assumptions used in the cost and undiscounted
and discounted cash flow analyses require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate growth rates, and the amount and
timing of expected future cash flows. The Company’s forecasted cash flows were based on the current assessment of the markets and
were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. The key assumptions used in the cash flows were revenue growth
rates, operating expenses and gross margins and the discount rates in the discounted cash flows. The assumptions used consider the current
early growth stage of the Company, the current investment levels projected. The industry markets are currently at volatile levels and
future developments are difficult to predict. The Company believes that its procedures for estimating future cash flows for each reporting
unit, asset group and intangible asset are reasonable and consistent with current market conditions as of the testing date. If the markets
that impact the Company’s business continue to deteriorate, the Company could recognize further goodwill and long-lived asset impairment
charges.

table below reflects the adjusted gross carrying amounts for these intangible assets. The intangible amounts comprising the intangible
asset balance are as follows:

Senior
Convertible Note
On
February 22, 2022, the Company exchanged the existing senior convertible note (the “Old Senior Convertible Note”) with a
remaining principal of $ 29,150,001 , with the Senior Convertible Note in the aggregate principal of $ 35,000,000 . On September 19, 2022
as part of the Company’s September 2022 Offering (Note 17) of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock, the
Company remitted to the Holder an amount of $ 2,778,427
from the proceeds reducing the Senior Convertible Note principal balance to $ 32,221,573
as recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. On December 19, 2022, as part of the Registered
Direct Offering the Company paid the Holder an amount of $ 1,073,343
for interest due and interest prepaid through February 28, 2023.
The
Company has not maintained compliance with certain debt covenants and is currently in default under the terms of the Senior Convertible
Note.
Subsequent
to period end, on January 27, 2023, the Company received the written consent of the Holder to lower the conversion price of the Senior
Convertible Note into shares of Common Stock under Section 7(g) of the Senior Convertible Note to
90 %
of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the Senior Convertible Note) of the Common Stock for a trading day during the five ( 5 )
consecutive trading day period ending, and including, the applicable date that the conversion price is lowered for purposes of a conversion
(as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations and similar events during such measuring period)
until further written notice to the Holder from the Company.
After including the
impact of the conversions reducing the Senior Convertible Note by $ 18,861,573   and the Amendment increasing the Senior Convertible
Note by $ 2,950,000 , for fees of $ 450,000
and converted accrued liabilities of $ 2,500,000 , on February 17, 2023, one business
day preceding this filing, the Company has reduced its outstanding debt on the Senior Convertible Note to $ 16,310,000 .
The
interest rate on the Senior Convertible Note is
8.0 %
per annum (consistent with the Old Senior Convertible Note), and from and after
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Convertible Note), the interest rate shall
automatically be increased to
12 .0% per annum. As further described below, the Company was not in compliance with certain debt covenants
under the Senior Convertible Note as of September 30, 2021 or subsequently. The Company has been accruing interest expense at a rate
of
12 % beginning March 31, 2022, the date it was initially not in compliance with certain debt covenants, as compared to using the set
rate of
8.0 % , and has recorded the additional $ 1,025,672
interest accrual for the difference in rates in accounts payable and accrued
expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, with $ 322,216
and $ 675,672
recorded in interest
expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
The maturity date of the Senior Convertible Note is June 2, 2023, subject to extension in certain circumstances, including bankruptcy
and outstanding events of default. The Company may redeem the Senior Convertible Note, subject to certain conditions, at a price equal
to
100 % of the outstanding principal balance outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid late charges thereon.
In
addition to the conversions discussed above, the Company is in discussions with the Holder to restructure its payment obligations,
including but not limited to eliminating the derivative liability on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and
addressing the Company’s default status under the debt.
In
connection with the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, which includes actions to be taken to
meet the minimum market value of listed securities or minimum stockholders’ equity, the Company may issue a perpetual
convertible preferred stock by March 31, 2023, to cover the remaining principal balance due under the Senior Convertible Note at the
time of entering the issuance.
Although
the Company and the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note are in discussions to determine the terms of the perpetual convertible
preferred stock, such terms have not been finalized and there is no assurance that the Company and the Holder will come to an
agreement on such terms. The ability of the Holder of the perpetual convertible preferred stock to convert such preferred stock into
shares of our common stock was approved in the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders held on January 26, 2023. The Company will
disclose the material terms of the perpetual convertible preferred stock in connection with the completion of the exchange
transaction, including the filing of a certificate of designation with the State of Nevada to designate the terms of such preferred
stock after the issuance of the stock. In addition, as part of the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and as approved in
the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company intends to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, with
our Board having approved
the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-one-hundred (1 for 100) , without a corresponding reduction in the total
number of authorized shares of common stock. Further, during the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders the Company obtained
stockholder approval for the issuance of such shares of Common Stock to the Holder that would exceed
19.99 %
of
the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock.
The
Senior Convertible Note is convertible, at the option of the Holder, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion
price of
$ 17.50
per share. The Senior Convertible Note is subject to a most favored nations provision and standard adjustments in the
event of any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction. If the Company enters into
any agreement to issue (or issues) any variable rate securities, the Holder has the additional right to substitute such variable price
(or formula) for the conversion price.
If
an Event of Default has occurred under the Senior Convertible Note, in addition to the default interest rate discussed above, the Holder
may elect to alternatively convert the Senior Convertible Note at the Alternate Conversion Price (as defined in the Senior Convertible
Note). In connection with an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the Senior Convertible
Note. The redemption price will equal
the
outstanding principal of the Senior Convertible to be redeemed, and accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid late charges thereon, or an
amount equal to market value of the shares of the Company’s Common Stock underlying the Senior Convertible Note, as determined
in accordance with the Senior Convertible Note, if greater.
The
Holder will not have the right to convert any portion of a Senior Convertible Note, to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion,
the Holder (together with certain related parties) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of the Company’s Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. The Holder may from time to time increase this limit to 9.99%,
provided that any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after delivery of a notice to the Company of such increase.
The
Company is currently in default and the Holder has not yet elected to alternatively convert.
25
Should
the Holder convert the principal balance outstanding at December 31, 2022 at the Alternate Conversion Price that is currently available
to the Holder, or a portion of the principal balance, the Company may be subject to remit amounts to the Holder materially in excess
of the principal balance outstanding through payment of cash. Refer to the Alternate Conversion discussion below for further information
of this settlement option available to the Holder.
In
connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Convertible Note), the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or
any portion of the Senior Convertible Note.
The redemption price per share will equal the greatest of (i) 115% of the outstanding principal
of the Senior Convertible Note to be redeemed, and accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid late charges thereon, (ii) 115% of the market
value of the shares of the Company’s Common Stock underlying the Senior Convertible Note, as determined in accordance with the
Senior Convertible Note, and (iii) 115% of the aggregate cash consideration that would have been payable in respect of the shares of
the Company’s Common Stock underlying the Senior Convertible Note, as determined in accordance with the Senior Convertible Note.
At
any time after the date the Company provides notice to the Holder of the Company incurring additional debt, the Holder will have the
right to have the Company redeem all or a portion of the Senior Convertible Note at a redemption price of
106 % of the portion of the
Senior Convertible Note subject to redemption.
If an Event of Default occurs, the Holder of the Senior
Convertible Note has the right to alternate conversion (“Alternate Conversion”) and may elect to convert the Senior Convertible
Note in cash due upon such an acceleration of the applicable principal, at a price (“Alternate Conversion Price”) equal to
the greater of the Conversion Floor Price of $ 2.1832
or a price derived from the volume weighted average price of the Company’s
Common Stock at the time of Alternate Conversion. If the Alternate Conversion were to include the Conversion Floor Price of $ 2.1832
as
the Alternate Conversion Price, the Company would be required to settle in cash any difference between the market value of the shares
subject to the Alternate Conversion using the floor price and the market value of the shares using the Alternate Conversion Price, excluding
any reference to the floor, based on the formula as stipulated in the Senior Convertible Note agreement.
The
Senior Convertible Note agreement includes provision that should the Company be in both breach of its debt covenants and its price per
common share trade below the conversion floor price of $ 2.1832
(the “Conversion Floor Price”), the
Holder may elect the Alternate Conversion option that includes a make-whole provision payable to the Holder in cash. At March 31, 2022 and through the date of issuance of this report, the Company was in breach
of its debt covenants and the price per share of its Common Stock had declined below the Conversion Floor Price. As a result, the make
whole provision in the Senior Convertible Note was determined to represent an obligation of the Company under the terms of the Senior
Convertible Note. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company estimates it would be required to issue up to
14,758,874
and
16,031,513
shares of Common Stock under the Alternate Conversion
make whole provision of the Senior Convertible Note, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company also estimates the fair value of
the derivative liability, which gives effect to the cash amount payable to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provisions
of the Senior Convertible Note, to be $ 799,954 .
While the Company records a derivative liability at each reporting period for the amount contingently payable to the Holder under the
Alternate Conversion make-whole provision, a strict application of the formula in the Senior Convertible Note indicates the cash liability
to the Holder may be materially higher than the derivative liability. A calculation of the cash liability due to the Holder under the
Alternate Conversion make-whole provision of the Senior Convertible Note indicated a liability of approximately $ 933,000,000
at December 31, 2022. The derivative liability
amount recognized by the Company for its obligation to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provision of the Senior Convertible
Note is subject to material fluctuation at each reporting date. The output of the Monte Carlo model that is used to estimate the fair
value of the derivative liability will fluctuate based on the Company’s share price, market capitalization, estimated enterprise
value, and the Company’s estimate of credit and non-performance risk. The Company is currently in default and the Holder has not yet elected to alternatively convert. See further discussion
in make-whole derivative liability below. See Note 17 for further discussion of the fair value determined for the derivative liability.
Under
the Senior Convertible Note, and consistent with the Old Senior Convertible Note, the Company is subject to certain customary affirmative
and negative covenants regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness, the payment of
cash in respect of dividends, distributions or redemptions, and the transfer of assets, among other matters. The Company is also subject
to certain financial debt covenants relating to available cash, minimum annual revenues, ratio of debt to market capitalization and minimum
cash flow.
The
Senior Convertible Note is subject to a most favored nation provision and standard adjustments in the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction. If the Company enters into any agreement to issue, or issue
any variable rate securities, the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note has the additional right to substitute such variable price (or
formula) for the conversion price. If the Holder were to substitute a floor price of $ 2.1832
(“Conversion Floor Price”) as
the variable price, the Company would be required to settle in cash any difference between the market value of the shares subject to
conversion at the floor price and the market value of the shares using the variable price, excluding any reference to the floor. The
Holder of the Senior Convertible Note also has the right to have the Company redeem all or a portion of the Senior Convertible Note should
the Company provide notice of incurring additional debt.
26
At
December 31, 2022, the Company is in default under the terms of the Senior Convertible Note. The Senior Convertible Note matures in less
than 12 months from December 31, 2022, and the Company has continued to recognize its obligation under the Senior Convertible Note as
a current liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company has not remitted payment to the Holder of the
Senior Convertible Note an amount equal to 30% of the gross proceeds from the March 2022 Offering to be applied as a reduction of principal.
The
Old Senior Convertible Note was issued by the Company to the Holder on June 2, 2021 in the principal amount of $ 35,000,000
with the Company receiving proceeds at issuance
of $ 32,515,000 ,
net of debt issuance costs of $ 2,485,000
for an aggregate principal. The Old Senior Convertible
Note was issued with
2,000,000
Series A Warrants and
2,000,000
Series B Warrants. On the date of issuance, the
Company recorded the fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants as a discount to the Old Senior Convertible Note totaling
$ 26,680,000 .
The debt discount was amortized to interest expense over the term of the Old Senior Convertible Note using the effective interest method
until extinguishment. The obligation resulting from the issuance of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants was determined to qualify
for liability classification on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. See below for further discussion of the Series A
Warrants and Series B Warrants. The Old Senior Convertible Note was convertible, at the option of the Holder, into shares of the Company’s
Common Stock at a conversion price of $ 17.50
per share. The conversion amounts were calculated
as the principal balance identified for conversion plus the Premium on Principal.
Prior
to the default, it was previously determined that the Company was not in compliance with the Old Senior Convertible Note covenants at
September 30, 2021 and subsequent reporting dates. The Company therefore requested and received a waiver dated October 13, 2021 for (i)
any known breaches or potential breaches of financial covenants in effect related to the available cash test and minimum cash flow test
through December 25, 2021, (ii) any known breach resulting from the placement of a lien on the outstanding share capital of Prozone Limited,
the entity that holds the assets of Bethard, and (iii) any known breach which would result from the Company’s announcement that
it would purchase an equity interest in Game Fund Partners Group LLC through the contribution of up to
200,000
shares of Common Stock.
In addition, the Company requested and received an amendment to the Old Senior Convertible Note wherein the permitted ratio of outstanding
debt to market capitalization was increased temporarily from 25% to 35% through December 25, 2021.
In consideration for the October 13,
2021 waiver, the Company agreed to permit the conversion of up to $ 7,500,000
of the original principal balance of the Old Senior Convertible
Note at the Alternate Conversion Price into shares of Common Stock, exclusive of the Premium on Principal and 15% premium payable that
applies to an Alternate Conversion. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note had converted
the full principal amount of $ 7,500,000
into
2,514,459
shares of Common Stock. As a result of these conversions of principal, the Company
recorded a loss on conversion of Senior Convertible Notes of $ 5,722,915
in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2021. The loss on conversion included accelerated amortization of the debt discount
of $ 4,515,273 , accelerated amortization of the Premium on Principal of $ 288,300
and the Incremental Premium due on conversion of $ 919,342 .
The Company also recorded accrued interest on the converted principal amount of $ 16,986
for the three and six months ended December 31,
2021, as well as a loss of $ 1,482,621
resulting from the change in fair value of the Conversion Option at the Alternate Conversion Price
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Holder converted
the remaining principal amount of $ 1,734,000
into common stock under the waiver, exclusive of the Premium on Principal and Incremental
Premium that applies to an Alternate Conversion. The conversion of the remaining principal amount under the waiver resulted in the issuance
of
812,618
shares of common stock in three tranches on January 11, 2022, January 24, 2022 and January 31, 2022. The Company further recorded
a loss on conversion of the senior convertible note of $ 276,747
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 for the Incremental
Premium due on the conversions, as well as accrued interest on the conversions of $ 6,949
for the three and six months ended December
31, 2021.
The
Company previously obtained a waiver from the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note on November 2, 2021 in connection with its announcement
to commence an underwritten registered public offering of its
10.0 %
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note
14). In consideration for this waiver, the Company agreed to increase the cash price payable upon a redemption of the Old Senior Convertible
Note by the Company to be equal to
10 %
of the conversion amount, as defined in Old Senior Convertible Note agreement as any unpaid principal,
minimum return due to the Holder, and unpaid interest due on such redemption date. The Company agreed to pay the Holder of the Old Senior
Convertible Note an amount of $ 1,500,000
under the terms of a registration rights agreement. The Company recognized the amount payable
to the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note under the registration rights agreement in other non-operating income (loss), net, in
the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 and the amount remains unpaid and recorded as accounts payable
and accrued expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
27
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had not maintained compliance with certain covenants of the Old Senior Convertible
Note, having identified non-compliance with the covenants previously identified at September 30, 2021. In consideration for obtaining
a waiver from the compliance with certain covenants, as of December 31, 2021 and through March 30, 2022, and as discussed above, the
Company has agreed to enter into an exchange agreement whereby the Company has exchanged the Old Senior Convertible Note with the Senior
Convertible Note resulting in the increase of the principal outstanding balance of indebtedness from the current carrying value $ 29,150,001 ,
as adjusted for the conversions of principal and Premium on Principal through February 22, 2022, to $ 35,000,000 . The increase in the
principal balance of $ 5,849,999
was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of Senior Convertible Note on the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company has further accelerated the recognition of
the remaining debt discount and Premium on Principal in connection with the exchange and issuance of the New Note. This resulted in the
recognition of a loss on extinguishment of the Senior Convertible Note of $ 22,628,805
for the three and six months ended December 31,
2021 in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Make-Whole
Derivative Liability
The
Senior Convertible Note agreement includes provision that should both the Company be in breach of its debt covenants and its price per
common share trade below the Conversion Floor Price of $ 2.1832 , the Holder may elect the Alternate Conversion option that includes a
make-whole provision payable to the Holder in cash. At December 31, 2022, both the Company was in breach of its debt covenants and the
price per share of its Common Stock had declined below the Conversion Floor Price. While the Company previously obtained waivers from
the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note for breach of covenants, as well as a waiver for breach of covenants through March 30,
2022 under the Senior Convertible Note, the Company was unable to comply with the debt covenants under the Senior Convertible Note or
otherwise obtain a debt waiver from March 31, 2022 through the six months ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent to the period end. As
a result, the make-whole provision in the Senior Convertible Note agreement was determined to represent an obligation of the Company
at December 31, 2022 under the terms of the Senior Convertible Note.
The
make-whole provision in the Senior Convertible Note is a derivative liability. The Company’s obligation to make a payment under
the make-whole provision was previously assessed as remote with an immaterial fair value. This considered that the Company had obtained
debt waivers from the Holder for its breaches of debt covenants. The Company’s historical stock price had also traded at levels
significantly in excess of the Conversion Floor Price. At December 31, 2022, the Company has been unable to complete an agreement to
restructure the terms and covenants of the Senior Convertible Note. The stock price further continues to trade materially below the Conversion
Floor Price and the Company has also been unable to secure a debt waiver. The fair value of the derivative liability at December 31,
2022 was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 for further discussion of the fair value determined for the derivative
liability.
At
December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that it would be required to issue up to
14,758,874
shares of Common Stock under the Alternate Conversion
provisions of the Senior Convertible Note. The Company further estimated the derivative liability to the Holder to be $ 799,954
and $ 9,399,620
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively,
which is included in the derivative liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and the expense was recorded in
the change in fair value of derivative liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The make-whole liability
calculated under the terms of the note of approximately $ 933,000,000
was materially higher than the fair value of
$ 799,954
determined as of December 31, 2022 and considers
the difference in the market price of the Company’s shares and a floor price of $ 2.1832
multiplied by a number of shares that is based on the
outstanding principal and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock at December 31, 2022. The calculated make-whole liability
may differ materially from the amount at which the Company may be required to pay under the Senior Convertible Note. The Company has
held non-binding discussions with the Holder to restructure its obligation under the Senior Convertible Note. However, there can be no
guarantee that the Company will be able to reach an agreement to restructure the Senior Convertible Note.

additional disclosures related to the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities.
Series
A and Series B Warrants
On
June 2, 2021, the Company issued
2,000,000
Series A Warrants and
2,000,000
Series B Warrants to the holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note. The Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the Old Senior
Convertible Note was exchanged for the Senior Convertible Note did not impact the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants previously
issued and outstanding. The Series A Warrants may be exercised at any time after issuance for one share of Common Stock of the
Company at an exercise price of $ 17.50 .
The Series B Warrants may only be exercised to the extent that the indebtedness owing under the Senior Convertible Note is redeemed.
As a result, for each share of Common Stock determined to be issuable upon a redemption of principal of the Senior Convertible Note,
one Series B Warrant will vest and be eligible for exercise at an exercise price of $ 17.50 .
The
Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants are callable by the Company should the volume weighted average share price of the Company
exceed $32.50 for each of 30 consecutive trading days following the date such warrants become eligible for exercise. The Series A
Warrants and Series B Warrants also contain a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% which may be increased up to 9.99%, provided
that any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after delivery of a notice to the Company of such
increase .
29
The
Company determined the Series A and Series B Warrants should be classified as a liability as the warrants are redeemable for cash in
the event of a fundamental transaction, as defined in the Senior Convertible Note, which includes a change in control. The Company has
recorded a liability for the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants at fair value on the issuance date with subsequent changes in fair
value reflected in earnings. At June 30, 2022 the Company determined the total fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants
to be $ 122,730 , with a fair value of $ 117,340
determined for the Series A Warrants, and a fair value of $ 5,390
and determined for the
Series B Warrants. At December 31, 2022, the Company determined the total fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants to
be $ 16,777
with a fair value of $ 16,486
determined for the Series A Warrants and a fair value of $ 291
determined for the Series B Warrants.
The change in fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants liability recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was a decrease of $ 105,953
and for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2021 was a decrease of $ 8,651,922
and $ 20,460,522 , respectively. See Note 16 for additional disclosures related to the change
in the fair value of the warrant liabilities.
The
proceeds from the issuance of the Old Senior Convertible Note were allocated to the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants using the
with-and-without method. Under this method, the Company first allocated the proceeds from the issuance of the Old Senior Convertible
Note to the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants based on their initial fair value measurement, and then allocated the remaining proceeds
to the Old Senior Convertible Note. The debt discount on the Old Senior Convertible Note was being amortized over its term of two years.
The Company accelerated the amortization of the debt discount on the Old Senior Convertible Note and the amount was fully recognized
in the prior year ended June 30, 2022.

Contingencies
On
January 6, 2023, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Grant Johnson, filed a lawsuit in the United State District Court
for the Southern District of New York against the Company. The claim alleges breach by the Company of Mr. Johnson’s employment
agreement when it terminated him for “Cause” as defined in the agreement on December 3, 2022. Mr. Johnson seeks in
excess of $ 1,000,000
million as well as
200,000
shares of our Common Stock, plus attorney’s fees. After consulting with legal counsel, the Company believes the claims are
without merit and intends to defend against the claims vigorously. The case is captioned Grant Johnson v. Esports Entertainment
Group, Inc. 1:22-cv-10861 (SDNY).
During
October 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Bethard SPA where it agreed to pay € 6,535,753
(equivalent to $ 7,010,732
using exchange rates at December 31, 2022) through
installments equal to 12% of net gaming revenue until the Company has paid the balance or the Company spends € 13,120,000
in marketing
costs (equivalent to $ 14,073,483
using exchange rates at December 31, 2022). Due to this amendment, as of December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022 the Company has estimated the present value of the amount owed to be $ 6,192,912
and $ 3,328,361 ,
respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a loss of $ 3,044,019
and $ 2,864,551 ,
and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain of $ 1,851,446
for both periods, in the change in fair value
of contingent consideration in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Since
the acquisition of the Argyll UK EEG iGaming business on July 31, 2020, the Company has responded to periodic requests for information
from the UKGC in relation to information required to maintain its UK license following the change of corporate control. There have been
no adverse judgments imposed by the UKGC against the Company. On November 10, 2022, the Company determined that it would close
down its licensed remote gambling operation in the UK market. On November 15, 2022, as part of the winding down of the Argyll UK iGaming
operations, players were informed that they would no longer be able to place bets from November 30, 2022 and that they could withdraw
their balances through December 7, 2022. On December 8, 2022 Argyll UK surrendered its UK license and the surrender was confirmed by
the UKGC on December 9, 2022. Between December 7, 2022 and December 14, 2022 Argyll UK attempted to refund customer accounts that still
had remaining balances. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 100,000
still remained to be refunded to customers. Going forward, Argyll
UK will comply with requests for refunds to the extent required by law and in accordance with Argyll UK’s terms and conditions.
On
January 1, 2022, amendments to the Finnish Lotteries Act came into effect, further restricting marketing opportunities and enhancing
the enforcement powers of the Finnish regulator. Prior to these amendments coming into effect, in the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2021, the Company has received communications from the Finnish regulator requesting clarification on its marketing and gaming practices
related to its Finnish EEG iGaming operations. The Company responded to the initial communication in third quarter of fiscal year 2022
and received a second request for further clarification. On November 28, 2022, the Company provided its response, further addressing
its business and marketing operations in Finland. Further powers allowing the Finnish regulator to require blocking by payment service
providers of overseas operators who are targeting their marketing activities towards Finnish customers are also due to come into effect
in 2023. Operations in Finland run under the MGA license on the Lucky Dino in-house built iDefix casino-platform. On January 5, 2023,
the Company received a communication that the Finnish regulator was satisfied with the Company’s response and no adverse judgments
were imposed by the Finnish regulator against the Company.
The
Company at times may be involved in pending or threatened litigation relating to claims arising from its operations in the normal course
of business. Some of these proceedings may result in fines, penalties, judgments or costs being assessed against the Company at some
future time.
In
determining the appropriate level of specific liabilities, if any, the Company considers a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying
data and updates the Company’s evaluation as further information becomes known. Specific liabilities are provided for loss contingencies
to the extent the Company concludes that a loss is both probable and estimable. The Company did not have any liabilities recorded for
loss contingencies as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable, and the
possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
31
Other
than discussed above, the Company is currently not involved in any other litigation that it believes could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
The
Company is authorized to issue
10,000,000
shares of preferred stock.
On November 10, 2021, the
Company designated
1,725,000
shares of preferred stock as 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (“10%
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock”), with a par value of $ 0.001
per share and liquidation value of $ 11.00 .
On November 11, 2021, the Company announced that it priced an underwritten public offering
of preferred stock as 10% Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock in the first series issuance of preferred stock, of which
800,000
shares were issued
at $ 10
a share on November 16, 2021 for total gross proceeds of $ 8,000,000 , before deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated
offering expenses. Net proceeds from the sale, after deducting issuance costs totaled $ 7,265,000 .
32
In
addition, under the terms of the underwriting agreement for the public offering of the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Stock, the Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional
120,000
shares. On December 10,
2021, there was a partial exercise to purchase
35,950
shares. Net proceeds from the additional sale, after deducting issuance costs,
totaled $ 334,335 .
Conversion
Each
share of 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of the Company’s Common Stock
at a conversion price of $ 17.50
per common share. Subject to earlier conversion or redemption, the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Stock matures five years from issuance, or November 15, 2026, at which point the Company must redeem the shares
of 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock in cash.
Dividends
Dividends
on the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock accrue daily and are cumulative from the date of issuance. The
dividends on the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each
calendar month, when, as and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, at the rate of
10.0 %
per annum. In the event the
dividends are not paid in cash, the dividends shall continue to accrue at a dividend rate of
10.0 % .
Redemption
and Liquidation
The
10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is also redeemable, at the option of the Board of Directors, in whole
or in part, at any time on or after January 1, 2023.
The
10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock includes a change of control put option which allows the holders of the
10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to require the Company to repurchase such holders’ shares in cash
in an amount equal to the initial purchase price plus accrued dividends.
The
10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable upon certain deemed liquidation events, such
as a change in control. Because a deemed liquidation event could constitute a redemption event outside of the Company’s control,
all shares of preferred stock have been presented outside of permanent equity in mezzanine equity on the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets. The instrument is initially recognized at fair value net of issuance costs. The Company reassesses whether the
10%
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
is currently redeemable, or probable to become redeemable in the future,
as of each reporting date. If the instrument meets either of these criteria, the Company will accrete the carrying value to the redemption
value. The 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock has not been adjusted to its redemption amount as of December
31, 2022 because a deemed liquidation event is not considered probable.
33
The
10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is not mandatorily redeemable, but rather is only contingently redeemable,
and given that the redemption events are not certain to occur, the shares have not been accounted for as a liability. As the 10% Series
A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable on events outside of the control of the Company, all shares

Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a Subscription
and Investment Representation Agreement with a member of management, the Interim CFO of the Company, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to issue and sell one hundred ( 100 ) shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share,
for $ 10
per share in cash. The sale closed on December 21, 2022.
On December 21, 2022, the Company filed a certificate
of designation (the “Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of Nevada, effective as of the time of filing,
designating the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Certificate of Designation
provided that one hundred ( 100 ) shares of Series B Preferred Stock will have
25,000,000
votes each and will vote together with the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock as a single class exclusively with respect to any proposal to effect a reverse stock split
of the Company’s common stock. The Series B Preferred Stock was voted, without action by the holder, on the reverse stock proposal
in our 2022 Annual Meeting on January 26, 2023, in the same proportion as shares of common stock are voted. The Preferred Stock otherwise
had no voting rights except as otherwise required by the Nevada Revised Statutes. The reverse stock split proposal was approved during the
2022 Annual Meeting.
Conversion.
The
Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible.
Dividends
The
holder of Series B Preferred Stock, as such, is not entitled to receive dividends or distributions of any kind.
Voting
Rights
Except
as otherwise provided by the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or required by law, the holder of Series
B Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except that the holder of Series B Preferred Stock has the right to vote on any resolution or
proposal presented to the stockholders of the Company to approve a decrease in the number of the Company’s issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock, or reverse stock split of such issued and outstanding shares, within a range as determined by the Board in accordance
with the terms of such amendment (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal”), or as otherwise required by the Nevada Revised Statutes.
The outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have 25,000,000 votes per share.
The outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock shall vote together with the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share of Common Stock of the Company as a
single class exclusively with respect to the Reverse Stock Split Proposal and are not entitled to vote on any other matter except to
the extent required under the Nevada Revised Statutes.
The
shares of Series B Preferred Stock are voted, without action by the holder, on the Reverse Stock Split Proposal in the same proportion
as shares of Common Stock are voted (excluding any shares of Common Stock that are not voted), or otherwise, or which are counted as
abstentions or broker non-votes) on the Reverse Stock Split Proposal (and, for purposes of clarity, such voting rights shall not apply
on any other resolution presented to the stockholders of the Company).
Liquidation.
The
Series B Preferred Stock shall have no rights as to any distribution of assets of the Company for any reason, including upon a liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
and shall not affect the liquidation or distribution rights of holders of any other outstanding series of preferred stock of the Company,
if any.
34
Redemption.
The
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at any time (i) if such redemption is ordered
by the Board in its sole discretion, automatically and effective on such time and date specified by the Board in its sole discretion,
or (ii) automatically upon the stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. As used herein, the “Redemption Time”
shall mean the effective time of the redemption.
Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock redeemed in the redemption will be redeemed in consideration for the right to receive an amount equal
to $ 10
in cash (the “Redemption Price”) for each share of Series B Preferred Stock that is owned of record as of immediately
prior to the applicable effective time of the redemption and redeemed pursuant to the Redemption, payable upon the applicable effective
time of the redemption.
From
and after the time at which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are called for redemption (whether automatically or otherwise) in
accordance with the above, such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will cease to be outstanding, and the only right of the former
holder of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, as such, will be to receive the applicable Redemption Price. The shares of Series
B Preferred Stock redeemed by the Company will be automatically retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares
of preferred stock, upon such redemption. Notice of a meeting of the Company’s stockholders for the submission to such
stockholders of any proposal to approve the Reverse Stock Split constitutes notice of the redemption of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and results in the automatic redemption of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the effective time of the redemption
pursuant to the above. In connection with the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company has set apart funds for payment
for the redemption of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Stock, the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock were redeemed in whole following the effectiveness of stockholder approval of the reverse stock split proposal at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting held on January 26, 2023.
The holder of the Preferred Stock received consideration of $ 10
per share in cash, or $ 1,000
in the aggregate, on February 10, 2023.
The Series B Preferred Stock is not mandatorily redeemable,
but rather is only contingently redeemable, and given that the redemption events are not certain to occur, the shares have not been accounted
for as a liability. As the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable on events outside of the control of the Company,
all shares of Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock have been presented outside of permanent equity in mezzanine equity on the
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The
value of the derivative liability on the Senior Convertible Note at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was valued using a nonperformance
risk adjusted Monte Carlo valuation model using total assets less goodwill and an estimate of the Company’s total enterprise value
with the following valuation assumptions:

The
fair value of a derivative instrument in a liability position includes measures of the Company’s nonperformance risk. Significant
changes in nonperformance risk used in the fair value measurement of the derivative liability may result in significant changes to the
fair value measurement. The cash liability calculated under the terms of the Senior Convertible Note of approximately $ 933,000,000
is materially higher than the fair value of the
derivative liability of $ 799,954
calculated at December
31, 2022. The calculated make-whole liability may differ materially from the amount the Company may be required to pay under the Senior
Convertible Note. The Company has held non-binding discussions with the Holder to restructure its obligation under the Senior Convertible
Note. However, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to reach an agreement to restructure the Senior Convertible Note.

Assets
Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis
Assets
that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are remeasured when carrying value exceeds fair value. This includes the evaluation
of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. The Company’s estimates of fair value required it to
use significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including numerous assumptions with respect to
future circumstances that might directly impact each of the relevant asset groups’ operations in the future and are therefore uncertain.
The carrying value of the assets after any impairment approximates fair value.
The
Company assesses the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the fair value of goodwill using the income approach.
Inputs used to calculate the fair value based on the income approach primarily include estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate
that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant.
The
Company uses undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group for equipment and intangible assets. During the three and six
months ended December 31, 2022 , the Company recognized asset impairment charges to the goodwill of the EEG
iGaming Malta reporting unit in the EEG iGaming segment, and to the goodwill of the GGC reporting unit in the EEG Games segment (See
Note 6).

Segment Information
The
Company operates its business and reports its results through two complementary operating and reportable segments: EEG iGaming and EEG
Games, in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
EEG
iGaming includes the Company’s iGaming casino and sportsbook product offerings. Currently, the Company operates the business to
consumer segment primarily in Europe.
EEG
Games’ focus is on providing esports entertainment experiences to gamers through a combination of: (1) our proprietary infrastructure
software, GGC, which underpins our focus on esports and is a leading provider of local area network (“LAN”) center management
software and services, enabling us to seamlessly manage mission critical functions such as game licensing and payments, (2) online tournaments
(through our EGL tournament platform), and (3) player-vs-player wagering. Currently, we operate our esports EEG Games business in the
United States and Europe.
Operating
segments are components of the Company for which separate discrete financial information is available to and evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in making decisions regarding
resource allocation and assessing performance. The CODM assesses a combination of metrics such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate
the performance of each operating and reportable segment.
The
Company has recast previously reported information to conform to the current management view for all prior periods presented. The changes
to reportable segments had no impact to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
The
Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) as its measure of segment profit or loss. The following table highlights the Company’s
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis to net loss. Total capital
expenditures for the Company were not material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

A
measure of segment assets and liabilities has not been currently provided to the Company’s CODM and therefore is not shown below.

Sale
of Spanish iGaming Operations
On January 18, 2023, the Company
closed the transaction and sold its Spanish iGaming operations, including its Spanish iGaming license. The Company received
approximately $ 1,200,000
in
proceeds and $ 1,000,000
in
cash from the return of a deposit held with the Spanish regulator. Sixty-five percent (65%) of the proceeds and cash received is
required to be remitted to the Holder. The gain on sale was approximately $ 800,000 .
Sale
of Bethard iGaming Operations
On
February 14, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to sell its Bethard iGaming business, an
operator of online casino and sportsbook brands that is licensed in Malta and Sweden.
The sale of the Bethard business is
expected to close within two weeks of signing the SPA. The total purchase consideration in the SPA was determined by the parties to
be approximately € 9,600,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 10,300,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023) comprised of € 1,650,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 1,770,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023) of cash proceeds payable to the Company at closing, with an additional € 6,500,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 7,000,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023) of purchase consideration identified to a release of the Company’s obligations from
payment of the contingent consideration originating from the Bethard acquisition. The purchaser of the Bethard business will also
assume liabilities of approximately € 1,200,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 1,290,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023). The terms of sale allow for a cash holdback of € 150,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 160,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023) for a period of two months that may be used by the purchaser to compensate it for the
assumption of liabilities above agreed upon amounts under the SPA. Amounts owed by the purchaser to the Company of € 1,260,000
(equivalent
to approximately $ 1,350,000
using
exchange rates at February 14, 2023) will be settled as part of the transaction.
On February 16, 2023, the

Transaction”) and 100% of the proceeds of any additional indebtedness incurred in the future, into such bank account in favor of
the Holder, or, at the option of the Holder, redeem amounts under the Senior Convertible Note using such proceeds .
The Amendment also modifies
the Senior Convertible Note to increase the principal balance by $ 2,950,000
for additional interest and other amounts previously recorded
by the Company as liabilities to the Holder, as well as for fees for the Amendment. The Amendment further provides for a voluntary reduction
in the Conversion Price (as defined in the Senior Convertible Note) when the Company issues or is deemed to issue common stock in a future
registered offering at a price below the Conversion Price then in effect, to the lower issuance price in such offering, subject to certain
exceptions. The Amendment also provides rights to the Holder to participate in future Securities Transactions for a period of two years
from the later of the date of the Amendment and the date that no payment amounts due to the Holder remain outstanding. The Company incurred
fees of $ 460,000
as part of the amendment.
After including the
impact of the conversions reducing the Senior Convertible Note by $ 18,861,573
and the Amendment increasing the Senior Convertible
Note by $ 2,950,000 , for fees of $ 450,000
and converted accrued liabilities of $ 2,500,000 , on February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, the Company has reduced
its outstanding debt on the Senior Convertible Note to
$ 16,310,000 .

Overview
Esports
is skill based, competitive, organized video gaming by professional players, individually or as teams. Esports typically takes the form
of organized, multiplayer video games that include genres such as real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter and multiplayer
online battle arena games. As of December 31, 2022, the most popular esports games in the industry include
Dota 2 and League of Legends
(each multiplayer online battle arena games), and
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
(a first-person shooter game).
Fortnite,
Call of Duty¸ Overwatch,
and
Apex Legends
are other well-known popular esports games in the industry. Most major professional
esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events are broadcast live via streaming services including twitch.tv and youtube.com.
EEG
is an esports focused iGaming and entertainment company with a global footprint. EEG’s strategy is to build and acquire betting
and related platforms, and lever them into the rapidly growing esports vertical. We are focused on driving growth in two markets that
include iGaming (“EEG iGaming”) and esports (“EEG Games”).
We
have financed operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and short-term debt. Until revenues are sufficient to meet our
needs, we will continue to attempt to secure financing through equity or debt securities.
Basis
of Presentation
We
operate two complementary business segments: Our EEG iGaming business and our EEG Games business.
EEG
iGaming
Our
EEG iGaming business is comprised of our casino and sportsbook product offerings. Currently, we operate our EEG iGaming segment primarily
in Europe.
EEG
iGaming includes the esports betting platform with full casino and sportsbook functionality and services for EEG iGaming customers. Our
in-house gambling software platform, Phoenix, is a modern reimagined sportsbook that caters to both millennial esports bettors as well
as traditional sports bettors. Phoenix is being developed through the assets and resources from our FLIP Sports Limited acquisition.
EEG’s
goal is to be a leader in the large and rapidly growing sector of esports real-money wagering, offering fans the ability to wager on
professional esports events in a licensed and secure environment. From February 2021, under the terms of our MGA license, we are now
able to accept wagers from residents of over 180 jurisdictions including countries within the EU, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa,
on our ‘‘Vie.bet’’ platform.
Alongside
the Vie.bet esports focused platform, EEG owns and operates:
●
five online casino brands
of Lucky Dino Gaming Limited and Hiidenkivi Estonia OU, its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “Lucky Dino”),
licensed by the MGA on its in-house built iDefix casino-platform, and
●
Bethard Group Limited (“Bethard”) online sportsbook
and casino brands, operating under MGA, Spanish, Irish and Swedish licenses. The Company has entered into a share purchase agreement to sell the Bethard
business and it is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
In total, we currently hold three Tier-1
gambling licenses (Malta, Ireland, and Sweden (Swedish License will be sold as part of the Bethard sale)). Our core assets in Lucky Dino provide a foothold in mature markets in Europe into
which we believe we can cross-sell our esports offerings.
EEG
Games
EEG
Games’ focus is on providing esports entertainment experiences to gamers through a combination of: (1) our proprietary infrastructure
software, GGC, which underpins our focus on esports and is a leading provider of LAN center management software and services, enabling
us to seamlessly manage mission critical functions such as game licensing and payments, (2) online tournaments (through our Esports Gaming
League tournament platform), and (3) player-vs-player wagering. Currently, we operate our esports EEG Games business in the United States
and Europe.
We
believe that as the size of the market and the number of esports enthusiasts continues to grow, so will the number of esports enthusiasts
who gamble on events, which would likely increase the demand for our platform.
44
Impact
of COVID-19
COVID-19
emerged in December 2019 and has since adversely impacted global commercial activity, disrupted supply chains and contributed to significant
volatility in financial markets.
The
Company has previously indicated that a significant or prolonged decrease in consumer spending on entertainment or leisure activities
may have an adverse effect on demand for the Company’s product offerings, including in-person access to game centers and tournaments,
reducing cash flows and revenues, and thereby materially harming the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and may result in an
extended period of continued business disruption and reduced operations. A materially disruptive resurgence of COVID-19 cases or the
emergence of additional variants or strains of COVID-19 could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection
rates are highest. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor developments relating
to disruptions and uncertainties caused by COVID-19.

Operations
On February 14, 2023, the

The sale of the Bethard

to be approximately €9.6 million (equivalent to approximately $10.3 million using exchange rates at February 14, 2023) comprised
of €1.7 million (equivalent to approximately $1.8 million using exchange rates at February 14, 2023) of cash proceeds payable to
the Company at closing, with an additional €6.5 million (equivalent to approximately $7.0 million using exchange rates at February
14, 2023) of purchase consideration identified to a release of the Company’s obligations from payment of the contingent consideration
originating from the Bethard acquisition. The purchaser of the Bethard business will also assume liabilities of approximately €1.2

of €0.15 million (equivalent to approximately $0.16 million using exchange rates at February 14, 2023) for a period of two months
that may be used by the purchaser to compensate it for the assumption of liabilities above agreed upon amounts under the SPA. Amounts
owed by the purchaser to the Company of €1.3 million (equivalent to approximately $1.4 million using exchange rates at February 14,
2023) will be settled as part of the transaction.
On February 16, 2023, the
Company entered into an Amendment and Waiver Agreement (“Amendment”) as a condition to the closing of the sale of the Bethard
business. The Amendment requires the Company to deposit 50% of the proceeds from the sale of the Bethard business in a bank account in
favor of the Holder. The Amendment also requires the Company to deposit 50% of the proceeds of any permitted future sale of assets or
any subsequent debt or equity offer or sale (a “Securities Transaction”) and 100% of the proceeds of any additional indebtedness
incurred in the future, into such bank account in favor of the Holder, or, at the option of the Holder, redeem amounts under the Senior
Convertible Note using such proceeds.
The Amendment also modifies
the Senior Convertible Note to increase the principal balance by $3.0 million for additional interest and other amounts previously recorded
by the Company as liabilities to the Holder, as well as for fees for the Amendment. The Amendment further provides for a voluntary reduction
in the Conversion Price (as defined in the Senior Convertible Note) when the Company issues or is deemed to issue common stock in a future
registered offering at a price below the Conversion Price then in effect, to the lower issuance price in such offering, subject to certain
exceptions. The Amendment also provides rights to the Holder to participate in future Securities Transactions for a period of two years
from the later of the date of the Amendment and the date that no payment amounts due to the Holder remain outstanding. The Company incurred
fees of $0.5 million as part of the amendment.
After including the impact of the conversions reducing the Senior Convertible Note by $18.9 million and the Amendment increasing the Senior
Convertible Note by $3.0 million, for fees of $0.5 million and converted accrued liabilities of $2.5 million, on February 17, 2023, one
business day preceding this filing, the Company has reduced its outstanding debt on the Senior Convertible Note to $16.3 million.
Nasdaq
Continued Listing Rules or Standards
Compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Requirements
On April 11, 2022, the Company received a deficiency
notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company
was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price for the Company’s Common Stock had closed below
$1.00 per share for the previous thirty consecutive business days.
On June 7, 2022, the Company received a further letter
from Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company’s minimum Market Value of Listed Securities
(“MVLS”) was below the minimum of $35,000,000 required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2).
On October 11, 2022, the Company received a third
letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company’s Common Stock will be delisted, and the Company’s Common Stock
warrants traded under the symbols GMBLW and GMBLZ and the Company’s 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock
traded under symbol GMBLP will no longer qualify for listing, and in that regard trading of the Company’s Common Stock, Common Stock
warrants and 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock will be suspended. The Company requested an appeal with the
Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) and the hearing was held on November 17, 2022.
On November 30, 2022, the Company received a determination
from the Panel granting the Company’s request for the continued listing of its common stock on the Capital Market tier of Nasdaq,
subject to the Company evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price, and the $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirement,
as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1), respectively, on or before February 7, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively,
and adhering to certain other conditions and requirements described below.
On December 6, 2022, the Company received a fourth
letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) requiring the Company to maintain
a MVLS at a minimum of $35,000,000. This was addressed in the November 17, 2022, hearing before the Panel where the Company presented
on its plan to comply with the Rule 5550(b)(2) or alternative criteria and was granted continued listing subject to the criteria noted
above.
From the initial determination, the Company has completed conditions 1
and 2:
1.
On or before January 13, 2023, the Company shall file a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC for a $10 million public offering;
2.
On January 26, 2023, the Company shall obtain stockholder approval for a reverse stock split at a ratio that is sufficient to ensure compliance with the Bid Price Rule;
On January 13, 2023, the Company filed its S-1,
subject to amendments, and on January 26, 2023, as part of the 2022 annual meeting, the Company obtained stockholder approval for
the of the common stock at a ratio of not less than one-for-twenty (1-for-20) and not more than one-for-one-hundred (1-for-100),
with our Board having approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-one-hundred (1 for 100), without a corresponding reduction in
the total number of authorized shares of common stock, and to be in effect no later than February 22, 2023 to meet the minimum bid
price compliance milestone.
On February 8, 2023 the Company received notice from
the Panel updating its remaining conditions as follows:
1.
On February 20, 2023, the Company shall provide a written update to the Panel regarding the progress of its debt-to-equity conversion plan and its impact on the Company’s equity;
2.
On March 7, 2023, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions; and
3.
On March 31, 2023, the Company shall demonstrate compliance with the shareholder equity requirement, as outlined in Equity Rule.
The Company is working towards meeting all other conditions
related to regaining compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules including the conversion of the Senior Convertible Note.
46
Additionally, the Panel reserved the right to reconsider
the terms of this exception. As a result, any failure to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq
could result in delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq and negatively impact our company and holders of our common stock, including
by reducing the willingness of investors to hold our common stock because of the resulting decreased price, liquidity and trading of
our common stock, limited availability of price quotations and reduced news and analyst coverage. Delisting may adversely impact the
perception of our financial condition, cause reputational harm with investors, our employees and parties conducting business with us
and limit our access to debt and equity financing.
As discussed above, the Company is in the process
of taking definitive steps to comply with all applicable conditions and criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. There can be no assurances,
however, that the Company will be able to do so. The Company must satisfy the time frame granted by the Panel or Nasdaq will provide written
notification that its securities will be delisted. As part of the compliance plan the Company is negotiating with the Holder of its Senior
Convertible Note to restructure the Senior Convertible Note, including the derivative liability.
Regulatory
Environment
We
operate in both emerging and well-established competitive markets. We expect that our future growth will come from online gaming and
sports betting via expansions of gaming in existing jurisdictions; entrance into new jurisdictions and, improvements and expansions of
our existing properties and strategic acquisitions of gaming properties, expanded software sales to more screens in game centers including
in universities, entertainment centers and casinos, as well as increased esports adoption and events, particularly in North America.
We continue to adjust operations and cost structures to reflect the changing economic conditions. We also continue to focus on revenue
and cost synergies from our acquisitions, and offering our customers additional gaming experiences through our affiliates. The gaming
industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including game centers;
riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; online and retail sports betting; sports media companies;
gaming at taverns; gaming at truck stop establishments; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; the potential for increased
fantasy sports; significant growth of Native American gaming tribes, historic racing or state-sponsored i-lottery products in or adjacent
to states we operate in; and other forms of gaming.
United
Kingdom
Since
the acquisition of the Argyll UK EEG iGaming business on July 31, 2020, the Company has responded to periodic requests for information
from the UKGC in relation to information required to maintain its UK license following the change of corporate control. There have been
no adverse judgments imposed by the UKGC against the Company. In recent months, the Company reduced its spending on marketing and was
focused on retaining existing customers and reactivating past customers. On November 10, 2022, the Company determined that it would close
down its licensed remote gambling operation in the UK market. On November 15, 2022, as part of the winding down of the Argyll UK iGaming
operations, players were informed that they would no longer be able to place bets from November 30, 2022 and that they could withdraw
their balances through December 7, 2022. On December 8, 2022 Argyll UK surrendered its UK license and the surrender was confirmed by
the UKGC on December 9, 2022. Between December 7, 2022 and December 14, 2022 Argyll UK attempted to refund customer accounts that still
had remaining balances. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $0.1 million still remained to be refunded to customers. Going forward, Argyll
UK will comply with requests for refunds to the extent required by law and in accordance with Argyll UK’s terms and conditions.
Netherlands
A
new licensing regime was implemented in the Netherlands for online gaming operators, with applications being accepted from April 1, 2021.
EEG did not apply for a license after assessing the criteria for applying. The first licenses took effect on October 1, 2021. In a surprise
to the market, the Dutch Minister for Legal Protection issued guidance warning that even those operators that were not targeting the
Dutch market but were passively accepting Dutch customers would be punished, with authorities given the power to issue increased fines.
Prior to this guidance, operators had understood that passive acceptance of bets was permissible. The vast majority of unlicensed operators
(including EEG’s brands) promptly withdrew from the Dutch market completely on October 1, 2021, closing all active Dutch customer
accounts. The sudden and earlier than anticipated withdrawal from the Dutch market had a negative impact on the unlicensed operators
in the region. The sole period in which the Company had revenues from its EEG iGaming operations in the Netherlands was in the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2021.
Finland
On
January 1, 2022, amendments to the Finnish Lotteries Act came into effect, further restricting marketing opportunities and enhancing
the enforcement powers of the Finnish regulator. Prior to these amendments coming into effect, in the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2021, the Company has received communications from the Finnish regulator requesting clarification on its marketing and gaming practices
related to its Finnish EEG iGaming operations. The Company responded to the initial communication in third quarter of fiscal year 2022
and received a second request for further clarification. On November 28, 2022, the Company provided its response, further addressing
its business and marketing operations in Finland.
47
Further
powers allowing the Finnish regulator to require blocking by payment service providers of overseas operators who are targeting their
marketing activities towards Finnish customers are also due to come into effect in 2023. Operations in Finland run under the MGA license
on the Lucky Dino in-house built iDefix casino-platform.
On
January 5, 2023, the Company received a communication that the Finnish regulator was satisfied with the Company’s response and
no adverse judgments were imposed by the Finnish regulator against the Company.
Other
In
July 2020, the Swedish Ministry for Finance implemented a number of restrictive measures on online casino operators in reaction to the
impact of COVID-19 restrictions. These included caps on deposits and bonuses. This had a negative impact on revenues across the industry
during that period. These restrictions were lifted on November 14, 2021.
The
State of Ontario’s licensing regime came into force on April 4, 2022, meaning that any operator of gambling sites taking bets from
customers in Ontario will require a license to do so. Whilst EEG iGaming may wish to apply for a license in the future, it has decided
not to apply for a license at this time and therefore we blocked access to our site for users based in the territory in advance of that
date.
The
Company continues to monitor developments related to regulatory activities.
Key
Performance Indicators
In
the industry, revenue is driven by discretionary consumer spending. We have no way of determining why customers spend more or less money;
therefore, we are unable to quantify a dollar amount for each factor that impacts our customers’ spending behaviors. However, some
insight into the factors that we believe are likely to account for such changes and which factors may have a greater impact than others,
include decreases in discretionary consumer spending have historically been brought about by weakened general economic conditions, such
as lackluster recoveries from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness
in the housing market and high fuel or other transportation costs. Such insights are based solely on our judgment and professional experience,
and no assurance can be given as to the accuracy of our judgments. The vast majority of our revenues is EEG iGaming revenue, which is
highly dependent upon the number and volume and spending levels of customers.
Reportable
Segments
At
December 31, 2022, the Company has two reportable segments: EEG iGaming and EEG Games, consistent with June 30, 2022. Prior periods presented
have been recast to reflect any change in reportable segments from the corresponding period.

Non-GAAP
Information
This
report includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
performance measure that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of this financial
information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared
and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision making
and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that it provides useful information about operating results,
enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect
to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable
to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. We define Adjusted
EBITDA as earnings (loss) before, as applicable to the particular period, interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization;
stock-based compensation; cost of acquisition; asset impairment charges; loss on extinguishment of senior convertible note; loss on conversion
of senior convertible note; change in fair value of derivative liability; change in fair value of warrant liability; change in fair value
of contingent consideration; and other non-operating income (loss), net, and certain other non-recurring, non-cash or non-core items,
as described in the reconciliation below, if not covered above.
Adjusted
EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring items (for example, in
the case of transaction-related costs), non-cash expenditures (for example, in the case of depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation, asset impairment charges, change in fair value of derivative liability and change in fair value of warrant liability),
or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense and litigation settlement
and related costs).

Results
of Operations
The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The financial data is at the consolidated
and reporting segment levels and reported in U.S. Dollar ($).
Comparison
on the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
Revenue
totaled $6.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 56%, from the $14.5 million recorded
in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased in the iGaming operations of Lucky
Dino, Bethard and Argyll that were impacted by regulatory changes in the Netherlands, Finland and the UK, and the worsening investment
and market conditions. The decrease in the iGaming segment revenue was $6.9 million falling from $12.4 million to $5.5 million. Revenue
in the EEG Games segment also decreased $1.2 million from $2.1 million to $0.9 million due to the disposal of the Helix Holdings, LLC
game center assets in Foxboro, MA and North Bergen, NJ that occurred in June 2022 and lower other revenues.
Cost
of Revenue
Cost
of revenue totaled $2.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 63%, from the $6.5 million
recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in the iGaming operations
of Lucky Dino, Bethard and Argyll in the EEG iGaming segment and includes corresponding EEG iGaming decreases in line with revenue of
$2.3 million for payment processing fees, platform costs, gaming duties and costs related to revenue sharing arrangements, $0.8 million
for the game provider expenses and $0.2 million for lower other direct expenses related to the delivery of services. EEG Games also had
a reduction in costs with $0.7 million lower game provider costs.
Sales
and Marketing
Sales
and marketing expense totaled $1.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 74%, compared
to the $6.9 million recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million
reduction in marketing and $3.3 million lower affiliate costs related to the EEG iGaming segment and a $1.0 million reduction in Corporate
expense driven by $0.9 million less incurred for sponsorship agreements with professional sports clubs and our service partners.
General
and Administrative
General and administrative expense totaled $7.6 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 42%, compared to the $13.2 million recorded for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of $0.8 million in payroll costs, $0.6 million depreciation
and amortization, and $0.8 million decrease related to other general and administrative cost primarily from cost savings in information
technology related disbursements from the EEG iGaming segment, and further decreases of $0.7 million depreciation and amortization, and
$0.4 million related to other general and administrative costs from the EEG Games segment. Corporate general and administrative costs
decreased $1.8 million lower share based compensation expense and $0.7 million less other general and administrative cost primarily
including lower professional fees and legal expenses.
Asset Impairment Charges
During the three
months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s initiated a process to evaluate the strategic options for the EEG iGaming
business, including exploring a sale of EEG iGaming assets due to increasing regulatory burdens and competition. In December 2022,
the Company closed down its licensed remote gambling operation in the UK market and on December 9, 2022 surrendered its UK license,
as part of the winding down of the Argyll UK iGaming operations. Subsequent to the period end, the Company appointed a new CEO and a
new interim CFO and on January 18, 2023 sold its EEG iGaming Spanish license. As part of these changes the Company has been focused
on reducing costs in its businesses as it has seen the EEG iGaming revenues decline significantly from levels seen in the previous
year and previous quarters. This and uncertainties caused by inflation and world stability were determined to be a triggering event
and the long-lived assets of the Company were quantitatively tested for impairment. For the three and six months ended December 31,
2022, the Company recognized total goodwill asset impairment charges of $16.1 million, with asset impairment charges to the goodwill
to the iGaming reporting unit of $14.5 million, which is part of the EEG iGaming segment, and to the goodwill of the GGC reporting
unit of $1.6 million, which is part of the EEG Games segment. Further downturns in economic, regulatory and operating conditions
could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. There were no goodwill asset impairment charges recorded during
the three months ended December 31, 2021.
50
Other
Income (expense)
Other income (expense), net changed $35.2 million
from a loss of $27.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to income of $7.4 million for the three months ended December
31, 2022. The other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 results primarily from $1.0 million of interest expense related
to the Senior Convertible Note and an increase of $3.0 million for the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration due as
part of the Bethard agreement, offset by other income primarily made up of $8.3 million for the change in the fair value of the derivative
liability on Senior Convertible Note (as defined below) and $2.6 million from the reduction in fair value of the warrant liability. The
driver of the change in fair value of the warrants was a decrease of $1.5 million for the September 2022 Warrants (as defined below) issued
as part of the September 2022 Offering (as defined below) that decreased from the $3.8 million valued on issuance at September 30, 2022
to $2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and a decrease of $1.0 million for the March 2022 Warrants from $1.2 million at September 30, 2022
to $0.2 million at December 31, 2022.
Other
income (expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was an expense of $27.8 million. The other expense for the three months
ended December 31, 2021 results primarily from $6.0 million loss on the conversion of the Senior Convertible Note and $1.5 million loss
from the change in value of the related derivative liability, driven by the conversion of a principal amount of approximately $5.7 million
into 1.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, of the $7.5 million immediate conversion option provided to the Senior Convertible
Note holder as part of the October 13, 2021 waiver provided on the covenants related to the Senior Convertible Note and $28.5 million
of loss on extinguishment primarily attributable to amortization of the debt discount and the consideration to the holder for the February
22, 2022 waiver provided on the covenants related to the Senior Convertible Note and $2.4 million in interest expense. These expenses
were offset by other income primarily made up of $8.7 million from the reduction in fair value of the warrant liability established for
warrants convertible into shares of common stock that had been issued to the holder of the Senior Convertible Note and the recognition
of $1.9 million of income for the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration due as part of the Bethard transaction.

in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased in the iGaming operations of Lucky
Dino, Bethard and Argyll that were impacted by regulatory changes in the Netherlands, Finland and the UK, and the worsening investment
and market conditions. The decrease in the iGaming segment revenue was $13.0 million falling from $27.1 million to $14.1 million. Revenue
in the EEG Games segment also decreased $1.9 million from $3.8 million to $1.9 million due to the disposal of the Helix Holdings, LLC
game center assets in Foxboro, MA and North Bergen, NJ that occurred in June 2022 and lower other revenues.

recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in the iGaming operations
of Lucky Dino, Bethard and Argyll in the EEG iGaming segment and includes corresponding EEG iGaming decreases in line with revenue of
$3.7 million for payment processing fees, platform costs, gaming duties and costs related to revenue sharing arrangements, $1.2 million
for the game provider expenses and $0.4 million for lower other direct expenses related to the delivery of services. EEG Games also had
a reduction in costs with $1.4 million lower platform and game provider costs.
Sales
and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense
totaled $4.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 69%, compared to the $14.3 million recorded
for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.1 million reduction in marketing, $0.2 million
lower affiliate costs and $6.4 million lower sponsorship costs related to the EEG iGaming segment and a $1.8 million reduction in Corporate
expense driven by $1.5 million less incurred for sponsorship agreements with professional sports clubs and our service partners, offset
by $1.0 million higher other sales and marketing costs.
General
and Administrative
General and administrative expense totaled $17.0 million
for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.3 million, or 30%, compared to the $24.3 million recorded for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of $1.9 million in payroll costs, $1.4 million depreciation
and amortization, and $0.5 million decrease related to other general and administrative cost primarily including incremental costs for
information technology related disbursements from the EEG iGaming segment, and further decreases of $1.5 million depreciation and amortization,
and $0.8 million related to other general and administrative costs from the EEG Games segment. Corporate general and administrative costs
decreased $1.3 million with $0.5 million higher payroll costs, offset by $1.2 million lower share based compensation expense and $0.6
million less other general and administrative cost primarily including lower professional fees and legal expenses.
Asset Impairment Charges
During the six months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s initiated a process to evaluate the strategic options for the EEG iGaming business,
including exploring a sale of EEG iGaming assets due to increasing regulatory burdens and competition. In December 2022, the Company
closed down its licensed remote gambling operation in the UK market and on December 9, 2022 surrendered its UK license, as part of
the winding down of the Argyll UK iGaming operations. Subsequent to the period end, the Company appointed a new CEO and a new
interim CFO and on January 18, 2023 sold its EEG iGaming Spanish license. As part of these changes the Company has been focused on
reducing costs in its businesses as it has seen the EEG iGaming revenues decline significantly from levels seen in the previous year
and previous quarters. This and uncertainties caused by inflation and world stability were determined to be a triggering event and
the long-lived assets of the Company were quantitatively tested for impairment. For the three and six months ended December 31,
2022, the Company recognized total goodwill asset impairment charges of $16.1 million, with asset impairment charges to the goodwill
to the iGaming reporting unit of $14.5 million, which is part of the EEG iGaming segment, and to the goodwill of the GGC reporting
unit of $1.6 million, which is part of the EEG Games segment. Further downturns in economic, regulatory and operating conditions
could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. There were no goodwill asset impairment charges recorded during
the six months ended December 31, 2021.
51
Other
Income (expense)
Other income (expense), net changed $29.1 million
from a loss of $19.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to income of $9.3 million for the six months ended December 31,
2022. The other expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 results primarily from $2.0 million of interest expense related to
the Senior Convertible Note and an increase of $2.9 million for the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration due as part
of the Bethard agreement, offset by other income primarily made up of $8.6 million for the change in the fair value of the derivative
liability on Senior Convertible Note (as defined below) and $5.0 million from the reduction in fair value of the warrant liability. The
driver of the change in fair value of the warrants was a decrease of $3.0 million for the September 2022 Warrants (as defined below) issued
as part of the September 2022 Offering (as defined below) that decreased from the $5.3 million valued on issuance at September 19, 2022
to $2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and a decrease of $1.9 million for the March 2022 Warrants from $2.1 million at June 30, 2022 to
$0.2 million at December 31, 2022.
Other
income (expense) for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was an expense of $19.8 million. The other expense for the six months ended
December 31, 2021 results primarily from $6.0 million loss on the conversion of the Senior Convertible Note and $1.5 million loss from
the change in value of the related derivative liability, driven by the conversion of a principal amount of approximately $5.7 million
into 1.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, of the $7.5 million immediate conversion option provided to the Senior Convertible
Note holder as part of the October 13, 2021 waiver provided on the covenants related to the Senior Convertible Note and $28.5 million
of loss on extinguishment primarily attributable to amortization of the debt discount and the consideration to the holder for the February
22, 2022 waiver provided on the covenants related to the Senior Convertible Note and $4.8 million in interest expense. These expenses
were offset by other income primarily made up of $20.5 million from the reduction in fair value of the warrant liability established
for warrants convertible into shares of common stock that had been issued to the holder of the Senior Convertible Note and the recognition
of $1.9 million of income for the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration due as part of the Bethard transaction.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
For
a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Capital
Resources and Liquidity
Liquidity
and Going Concern
The
Company must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
in this report are issued. The evaluation of going concern under the accounting guidance requires significant judgment.
The Company has determined that certain factors raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this report. One such factor considered by the Company is its compliance with certain debt
covenants under terms of the Senior Convertible Note (the “Senior Convertible Note”), issued by the Company on February 22,
2022 in the principal amount of $35.0 million with a December 31, 2022 outstanding carrying value of $32.2 million. The Company has not
maintained compliance with certain debt covenants and is currently in default under the terms of the Senior Convertible Note. The Company
repaid principal of $2.8 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022, using proceeds from the September 2022 equity financing
(“September 2022 Offering”). Subsequent to December 31, 2022 and through February 17, 2023, one business
day preceding this filing, the Company has converted $18.9 million of the Senior Convertible Note through the issuance of 217.2 million
shares of Common Stock. In addition, on February 14, 2023, the Company entered into the SPA for the sale of the Bethard business. On February
16, 2023, as a condition to the closing of the sale of the Bethard business, the Company entered into the Amendment with the of the Holder. After including the impact of the conversions reducing the Senior Convertible
Note by $18.9 million and the Amendment increasing the Senior Convertible Note by $3.0 million, for fees of $0.5 million and converted
accrued liabilities of $2.5 million, on February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, the Company has reduced its outstanding
debt on the Senior Convertible Note to $16.3 million. The Company will
continue to convert to further reduce this debt. The maturity date of the Senior Convertible Note is June 2, 2023. The Senior Convertible
Note is classified as a current liability on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and due to the default it may be redeemed
by the Holder prior to its maturity date. The Company has also recorded a derivative liability for the alternate conversion in the Senior
Convertible Note of $0.8 million in current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet that may be due to the Holder
as part of the make-whole liability under the default terms of the Senior Convertible Note. The cash liability calculated under the terms
of the Senior Convertible Note of approximately $933.0 million, is materially higher than the fair value of the derivative liability of
$0.8 million calculated at December 31 2022. The calculated make-whole liability may differ materially from the amount at which the Company
may be required to pay under the Senior Convertible Note.
In addition to the
conversions discussed above, the Company is in discussions with the Holder to restructure its payment obligations, including but not
limited to eliminating the derivative liability on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and addressing the
Company’s default status under the debt. In connection with the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq
Listing Rules, which includes actions to be taken to meet the minimum market value of listed securities or minimum
stockholders’ equity, the Company may issue a perpetual convertible preferred stock by March 31, 2023, to cover the remaining
principal balance due under the Senior Convertible Note at the time of entering the issuance. Although the Company and the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note are in discussions to determine the terms of the perpetual
convertible preferred stock, such terms have not been finalized and there is no assurance that the Company and the Holder will come
to an agreement on such terms. The ability of the Holder of the perpetual convertible preferred stock to convert such preferred
stock into shares of our common stock was approved in the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders held on January 26, 2023. The Company
will disclose the material terms of the perpetual convertible preferred stock in connection with the completion of the exchange
transaction, including the filing of a certificate of designation with the State of Nevada to designate the terms of such preferred
stock after the issuance of the stock. In addition, as part of the Company’s plan to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and as approved in
the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company intends to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, with
our Board having the discretion as to the exact ratio of any reverse stock split, without a corresponding reduction in the total
number of authorized shares of common stock. Further, during the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders the Company obtained
stockholder approval for the issuance of such shares of Common Stock to the Holder that would exceed 19.99% of the Company’s
outstanding shares of Common Stock.
52
In addition to compliance with debt covenants, the
Company considered that it had an accumulated deficit of $167.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and that it has had a history of recurring
losses from operations and recurring negative cash flows from operations as it has prepared to grow its esports business through acquisition
and new venture opportunities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had total current assets of $7.9 million and total current liabilities
of $54.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $8.5 million which includes a net
loss of $18.3 million. The Company also considered its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be
deemed outside the control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had $0.7 million of available cash on-hand and net current liabilities of $47.0 million. In addition to the Senior Convertible
Note conversions that are reducing the debt outstanding, on December 21, 2022, the Company closed an offering (the “Registered Direct
Offering”) in which it sold: (a) 7.1 million shares of Common Stock to the Holder and (b) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to
17.9 million at a price of $0.0937 per warrant, directly to the Holder, with all but $0.001 per warrant prepaid to the Company at the
closing. The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of Common Stock and pre-funded warrants before deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company was $2.3 million. The Company remitted approximately $1.1 million to the
Holder to be applied to accrued interest and future interest payments under the Senior Convertible Note. The net proceeds received by
the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company and amounts remitted
to the Holder was $1.1 million. On September 19, 2022 the Company closed the September 2022 Offering in which it sold: (a) 30.0 million
shares of Common Stock and (b) warrants to purchase up to 30.0 million shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.25 per share
(the “September 2022 Offering Warrants”), at an aggregate price of $0.25 per share and accompanying September 2022 Offering
Warrant. The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of Common Stock and Warrants before deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company was $7.5 million. On the issuance date, the Company also granted an overallotment
to the underwriters of the offering for 3.6 million overallotment warrants (“September 2022 Overallotment Warrants”), at a
purchase price of $0.01 per warrant, with an exercise price of $0.25 per warrant (the September 2022 Offering Warrants and September 2022
Overallotment Warrants are collectively referred to as the “September 2022 Warrants”). Total proceeds from the September 2022
Overallotment Warrants were less than $0.1 million. The Company remitted to the Holder an amount of $2.3 million equal to fifty percent
(50%) of all net proceeds above $2.0 million following the payment of 7% in offering fees including underwriting discounts and commissions.
In addition, as part of the September 2022 Offering, the Holder purchased $0.5 million of securities (2.1 million shares of Common Stock
and 2.1 million September 2022 Warrants) and the Company paid the Holder an additional $0.5 million. The proceeds remitted to the Holder
of the Senior Convertible Note reduced the principal balance of the Senior Convertible Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The net proceeds
received by the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company and amounts
remitted to the Holder was $4.1 million. On March 2, 2022 the Company closed an offering (the “March 2022 Offering”) in which
it sold 15.0 million units at $1.00 consisting of one share of Common Stock and one warrant for a total of 15.0 million warrants with
an exercise price of $1.00 (the “March 2022 Offering Warrants”). There was also an overallotment option exercised to purchase
warrants to purchase an additional 2.3 million shares of common stock (the “April 2022 Overallotment Warrants”) with an exercise
price of $1.00 issued to the underwriters of the offering on April 1, 2022 (the March 2022 Offering Warrants and the April 2022 Overallotment
Warrants are collectively referred to as the “March 2022 Warrants”). The March 2022 Offering provided net cash proceeds of
$13.6 million.
The
amount of available cash on hand on February 17, 2023, one business day preceding this filing, was approximately $1.0
million.
The Company believes that its current level of cash
and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund its operations and obligations without additional financing. Although the Company has
financing available, as further described below, the ability to raise financing using these sources is subject to several factors, including
market and economic conditions, performance, and investor sentiment as it relates to the Company and the esports and iGaming industry.
The combination of these conditions was determined to raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
In determining whether the Company can overcome the
presumption of substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, the Company may consider the effects of any mitigating
plans for additional sources of financing. The Company identified additional financing sources it believes, depending on market conditions,
may be available to fund its operations and drive future growth, which include (i) the potential expected proceeds from the recently filed
S-1 where the amount of the offering has not yet been determined, (ii) the potential proceeds from
the exercise of the 33.6 million September 2022 Warrants, exercisable at $0.25, outstanding at December 31, 2022, (iii) the potential
proceeds from the exercise of the 17.3 million March 2022 Warrants, exercisable at $1.00, outstanding at December 31, 2022, (iv) the ability
to sell shares of Common Stock of the Company through various forms of offerings, and (v) the ability to raise additional financing from
other sources. The Company is also continuing discussions with the Holder to restructure the payment terms and debt covenants.
The
Company’s sources and (uses) of cash for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are shown below:
2022
2021
Cash used in operating activities
$ 8,540,978
$ 7,599,212
Cash used in investing activities
$ 3,321
$ 20,185,745
Cash provided by financing activities
$ 5,792,240
$ 8,025,614
53
As noted above, at December 31, 2022, we had total
current assets of $7.9 million and total current liabilities of $54.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 was $8.5 million, which includes a net loss of $18.3 million, offset by net non-cash and balance sheet adjustments
of $9.8 million.
There
was less than $0.1 million net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $5.8 million, which related to $9.0 million
net proceeds from the December 2022 Registered Direct Offering and the September 2022 Offering, offset by the repayments of part of the
Senior Convertible Note principal of $2.8 million, repayments of notes payable and finance lease for less than $0.1 million and the payments
of the dividends on the 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock of $0.4 million.
These
above plans are likely to require the Company to place reliance on several factors, including favorable market conditions, to access
additional capital in the future. These plans were therefore determined not to be sufficient to overcome the presumption of substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates,
assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying
notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including, with respect to the six months ended December 31, 2022, related
regulatory and government mandates and restrictions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our
critical accounting policies are those that are both material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. There have been no material changes or updates to our critical
accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates
disclosed in our June 30, 2022 10-K.

4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer
performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. For the reasons set forth below, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Previously
identified material weakness
During
fiscal 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were not operating effectively at a reasonable assurance level. The material weaknesses identified during management’s assessment
included, but were not limited to, (a) not performing an ongoing and/or separate formal evaluation to determine whether the components
of internal control are present and functioning within the period under audit; (b) not having sufficient period-end financial reporting
controls in place as it relates to segregation of duties, reviews of certain completed or nonrecurring transactions, and certain procedures
for preparing the financial statements and disclosures; and (c) not having sufficient controls in place as it relates to information
technology (“IT”) controls and that the IT technology controls were not formally evaluated to determine operating effectiveness,
including the evaluation of system organization controls and related complementary user entity controls.
Remediation
Plans and Actions
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, and fiscal 2023, we continued and plan to continue to implement remediation initiatives in response
to the previously identified material weakness, including, but not limited to, (a) the recently hired internal audit executive continuing
to establish an internal audit function and guide management’s efforts related to the identification, implementation, execution,
and monitoring of an effective internal control environment; (b) developing plans and templates for executing the design, documentation,
and implementation of internal controls; (c) conducting training for process and control owners about the system of internal control
and Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”) requirements and control design and execution best practices; (d) continuing the implementation
of EGRC software to execute management’s internal control assessment process; (e) reinforcing accountability and retaining required
supporting control documentation, including the evaluation and implementation of a more controlled repository for retaining evidence;
(f) implementing reporting tools and procedures for the monitoring of SOX compliance throughout the organization; (g) performing detailed
analysis of segregation of duties to minimize duty conflicts where possible as well as properly mitigate risks of any unavoidable conflicts;
and (h) performing detailed assessment and evaluation of information technology general controls to ensure that proper controls are designed
and implemented including the evaluation of third-party system and organization control reports.
While
we believe the Company’s remediation efforts to-date have improved and will continue to improve our disclosure controls and procedures,
remediation of the material weakness will require validation and testing of the operating effectiveness of disclosure internal controls
over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control
over financial reporting, management may determine additional measures are necessary to address control deficiencies or determine that
it is necessary to modify the remediation plan described above. Management cannot provide assurance as to when the Company will remediate
such weaknesses, nor can management be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions.
Our
remediation efforts activities are ongoing and are subject to continued management review supported by ongoing design and testing. Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses, our management has concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Changes
in internal control over financial reporting
Other
than our ongoing remediation efforts with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures, which extend to our internal control over
financial reporting, there were no changes during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal
controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with
effective internal control over financial reporting during this interim reporting period and until a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)).
Inherent
limitation on the effectiveness of internal control
The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including
the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate
misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate
for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial
reporting.

1. Legal Proceedings
On
January 6, 2023, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Grant Johnson, filed a lawsuit in the United State District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Company. The claim alleges breach by the Company of Mr. Johnson’s employment agreement
when it terminated him for “Cause” as defined in the agreement on December 3, 2022. Mr. Johnson seeks in excess of $1,000,000
million as well as 200,000 shares of our Common Stock, plus attorney’s fees. After consulting with legal counsel, the Company believes the claims are without merit
and intends to defend against the claims vigorously. The case is captioned Grant Johnson v. Esports Entertainment Group, Inc. 1:22-cv-10861
(SDNY).
The
Company at times may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising from its operations in the normal course of business. Other
than disclosed above, the Company is currently not involved in any litigation that it believes could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court,
public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company
or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies
or our subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
