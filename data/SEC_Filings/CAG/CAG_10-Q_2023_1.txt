SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "Conagra Brands", "we", "us", or "our") have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting on Form
10 -Q. Accordingly, they do
not
include certain information and disclosures required for comprehensive financial statements. The unaudited financial information reflects all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods presented. During the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023,
it was determined that certain assets and liabilities previously presented as assets and liabilities held for sale within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
no
longer met the held for sale criteria. Assets of $ 58.9
million and liabilities of $ 4.1
million as of
May 29, 2022
have been reclassified to assets and liabilities held and used. All other adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for any quarter or a partial fiscal year period are
not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other periods or the full fiscal year. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
May 29, 2022 . There were
no
significant changes to our accounting policies from those disclosed in Note
1,
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in that Form
10 -K.
2.
RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Conagra Restructuring Plan
In fiscal
2019,
senior management initiated a restructuring plan for costs incurred in connection with actions taken to improve selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense effectiveness and efficiencies and to optimize our supply chain network (the "Conagra Restructuring Plan"). Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire Conagra Restructuring Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023 , including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of
November 27, 2022 , we had approved the incurrence of $ 184.0   million ($ 57.2  million of cash charges and $ 126.8
million of non-cash charges) for several projects associated with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. As of
November 27, 2022 , we had incurred or expected to incur $ 152.6  million of charges ($ 50.7  million of cash charges and $ 101.9  million of non-cash charges) for actions identified as of such date under the Conagra Restructuring Plan. In the
second  quarter and
first
half of fiscal
2023,
we recognized charges of $ 1.8  million and $ 5.9  million, respectively, in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. In the
second
quarter and
first
half of fiscal
2022,
we recognized charges of $ 6.6  million and $ 15.1
million, respectively, in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We expect to incur costs related to the Conagra Restructuring Plan over a multi-year period.
We anticipate that we will recognize the following pre-tax expenses in association with the Conagra Restructuring Plan (amounts include charges recognized from plan inception through the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023 ):

Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan
As of the end of the

2023,
we had substantially completed our restructuring and integration plan related to our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, Inc. ("Pinnacle") in

We had recognized $ 294.1
million in pre-tax expenses ($ 12.8  million in cost of goods sold and $ 281.3  million in SG&A expenses) from the inception of this plan through
November 27, 2022 , related to our continuing operations. Included in these results were $ 266.1  million of cash charges and $ 28.0  million of non-cash charges. Our total pre-tax expenses for the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan related to our continuing operations are expected to be $ 344.8  million ($ 283.6  million of cash charges and $ 61.2
million of non-cash charges). The remaining charges relate primarily to certain leased facilities that are
not
expected to be used in their current capacity through the contractual lease term.

DEBT AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we entered into an unsecured Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Term Loan Agreement provided for delayed draw term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 500.0
million. The Term Loan Agreement matures on
August 26, 2025.
During the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we borrowed the full $ 500.0
million aggregate principal amount available under the Term Loan Agreement. The proceeds were used to repay the full outstanding $ 250.0
million aggregate principal amount of our
3.25 % senior notes on their maturity date of
September 15, 2022,
as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at the sum of Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a
0.10 % per annum rate spread adjustment, plus a percentage spread (ranging from
0.90 % per annum to
1.375 % per annum) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term indebtedness ratings. The Company
may
voluntarily prepay term loans under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions. As of
November 27, 2022 , there were $ 500.0
million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement.
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2022,
we issued $ 500.0
million aggregate principal amount of
0.500 % senior notes due
August 11, 2023.
In the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any
one
time of $ 2.0
billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $ 2.5
billion with consent of the lenders). The revolving credit facility provided for under the Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Company's revolving credit facility under the prior revolving credit agreement, which was terminated. The revolving credit facility provided for under the Revolving Credit Agreement matures on
August 26, 2027
and is unsecured. The Company
may
request the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement be extended for additional
one -year or
two -year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. As of
November 27, 2022 , there were
no
outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to interest expense
not
to be less than
3.0
to
1.0
and our ratio of funded net debt to EBITDA
not
to exceed
4.75
to
1.0
through the
third
quarter of fiscal
2023
and
4.5
to
1.0
for each quarter thereafter, with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling
four -quarter basis. As of
November 27, 2022 , we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
As of
November 27, 2022  and
May 29, 2022 , we had $ 254.0
million and $ 180.0
million, respectively, outstanding under our commercial paper program.
We enter into various supplier financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the arrangement and amounts are classified as either Accounts payable or Notes payable within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have concluded that certain obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are impacted by
third -party service programs and therefore we have classified certain amounts outstanding under these programs as Notes payable. We had approximately $ 109.2  million of short-term borrowings as of
November 27, 2022  related to these arrangements.

$ 4,048.8     $ 469.8     $ 4,295.5     $ 437.7
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
management reorganized its reporting structure for certain brands within
two
reporting units in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. The change in management reporting required us to reassign assets and liabilities, including goodwill, between the reporting units, complete a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change, and evaluate other assets in the reporting units for impairment, including indefinite-lived intangibles (brand names and trademarks). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles was determined using the "relief from royalty" methodology.
8
Table of Contents
Fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Both the "relief from royalty" methodology used to value our indefinite-lived intangible assets and the discounted cash flow analysis require us to estimate the future cash flows as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for a reporting unit over a discrete period (typically
five
years) and a terminal period (considering expected long-term growth rates and trends). We used a discount rate of
7.75 % and a terminal growth rate that approximated
1 % in estimating the fair value of our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates in areas such as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows, discount rates, or terminal growth rates could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value.
As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized goodwill impairment charges within SG&A expenses of $ 141.7  million within our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit in the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023.   In addition, we recognized an impairment charge within SG&A expenses of $ 244.0  million related to our
Birds Eye ®
brand name in the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023.
The impairments were largely due to the
125
basis point increase in the discount rate as a result of current economic conditions, including a significant increase in interest rates since our last quantitative impairment tests, as well as a downward revision to our sales forecasts.
Amortizing intangible assets carry a remaining weighted average life of approximately
18  years. Amortization expense was $ 14.7  million and $ 29.5  million for the  second
quarter and  first
half of fiscal
2023 , respectively, and $ 14.8
million and $ 29.7
million for the  second
quarter and  first
half of fiscal  2022 , respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
November 27, 2022 , amortization expense is estimated to average $ 48.4  million for each of the next
five
years.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.
Commodity futures and option contracts are used from time to time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, packaging materials, dairy, grains, diesel fuel and electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to
36
months. We
may
enter into longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of
November 27, 2022 , we had economically hedged certain portions of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative instruments with expiration dates through
April 2024.
In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into forward exchange, option, or swap contracts from time to time for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. This includes, but is
not
limited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of
November 27, 2022 , we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative instruments with expiration dates through
August 2023.
From time to time, we
may
use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in interest rates. This includes, but is
not
limited to, hedging against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior long-term debt.
Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2019,
we entered into deal-contingent forward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to our issuance of long-term debt to help finance the acquisition of Pinnacle. We settled these contracts during the
second
quarter of fiscal
2019
and deferred a $ 47.5
million gain in accumulated other comprehensive income that is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. The unamortized amount at
November 27, 2022 , was $ 33.2
million.
Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows
Many of our derivatives do
not
qualify for, and we do
not
currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately.
Economic Hedges of Fair Values
—
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
may
use options and cross currency swaps to economically hedge the fair value of certain monetary assets and liabilities (including intercompany balances) denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. These derivatives are marked-to-market with gains and losses immediately recognized in SG&A expenses. These substantially offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses recognized as values of the monetary assets or liabilities being economically hedged change.
All derivative instruments are recognized on our balance sheets at fair value (refer to Note
13
for additional information related to fair value measurements). The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we offset certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as certain amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral and obligations to return cash collateral, where master netting agreements provide for legal right of setoff. At
November 27, 2022
and
May 29, 2022 , amounts representing an obligation to return cash collateral of $ 1.1
million and $ 4.0
million, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one
party. These transactions
may
expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties. We have
not
incurred a material loss due to nonperformance in any period presented and do
not
expect to incur any such material loss. We also enter into futures and options transactions through various regulated exchanges.
At
November 27, 2022 , the maximum amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, was $ 5.4
million.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
For the
second  quarter and
first
half of
2023,
we recognized total stock-based compensation expense (including restricted stock units, performance shares, and performance-based restricted stock units) of $ 36.0  million and $ 59.0  million, respectively. For the
second
quarter and
first
half of
2022,
we recognized total stock-based compensation expense of $ 11.7
million and $ 14.3
million, respectively. In the
first
half of fiscal
2023,
we granted
1.5  million restricted stock units at a weighted average grant date price of $ 33.14  and
0.7  million performance shares at a weighted average grant date price of $ 33.13 .

Table of Contents
Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goal for
one - third
of the target number of performance shares for the
three -year performance period ending in fiscal
2023
(the
"2023
performance period") is based on our fiscal
2021
diluted earnings per share ("EPS") compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"), subject to certain adjustments. The performance goal for the final
two -thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the
2023
performance period is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the
two -year period ending in fiscal
2023.
The performance goal for the
three -year performance period ending in fiscal  2024
(the
"2024
performance period") is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. The performance goals for the
three -year performance period ending in fiscal
2025
(the
"2025
performance period") are based on our net sales and diluted EPS growth, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period, with each year of the performance period weighted
one -third. For each of the
2023  performance period,
2024  performance period, and
2025  performance period, the awards actually earned will range from
zero
to
two hundred
percent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on the portion of performance shares actually earned at our regular dividend rate in additional shares of common stock.
Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has
not
been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding shares of common stock adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities.
The following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share:

INCOME TAXES
In the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023
and
2022 , we recognized income tax expense of $ 122.5
million and $ 84.2
million, respectively. In the  first
half of fiscal
2023
and
2022 , we recognized income tax expense of $ 136.9  and $ 153.9 , respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was  24.3 % and  23.4 % for the  second
quarter of fiscal
2023
and
2022 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the  first
half of fiscal
2023
and
2022  was  31.0 % and  23.1 %, respectively.
The effective tax rate in the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023
reflected additional tax expense from disallowed deductions related to incentive compensation plans resulting from an increased level of estimated achievement on performance targets and stock price, a tax benefit from statute lapses on state tax issues that were previously reserved, and a benefit from the adjustment of certain foreign taxes that were previously accrued.
The effective tax rate in the  first
half of fiscal
2023
reflected the above-cited items, as well as the impact of an impairment of goodwill that was largely non-deductible for tax purposes. During the
first
half of fiscal
2023,
goodwill impairment charges totaling $ 141.7
million were recognized with an associated tax benefit of $ 2.7
million.
The effective tax rate for the  second
quarter of fiscal  2022
reflected additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill related to assets previously held for sale for which an impairment charge was recognized, a tax benefit resulting from state law changes, and a benefit from statute lapses on state tax issues that were previously reserved.
The effective tax rate in the  first
half of fiscal  2022
reflected the above-cited items as well as a benefit of $ 3.6
million from the settlement of tax issues that were previously reserved.
The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions was $ 29.7
million as of
November 27, 2022
and $ 62.9
million as of
May 29, 2022 . In the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we have adjusted our reserve with respect to certain elections made based on our current expected filing position. The impact of these elections did
not
impact our effective tax rate. The gross unrecognized tax benefits excluded related liabilities for gross interest and penalties of $ 6.8
million and $ 6.7
million as of
November 27, 2022
and
May 29, 2022 , respectively.
The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at
November 27, 2022
and
May 29, 2022
that, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company's effective tax rate was $ 26.0
million and $ 58.0
million, respectively.
We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $ 4.8
million over the next
twelve
months due to various state audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.
In the prior year, we made the assessment that the current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were
not
indefinitely reinvested or that we could
not
remit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 6.4
million on approximately $ 128.6
million of earnings at
November 27, 2022 . The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. The undistributed historic earnings in our foreign subsidiaries through
May 30, 2021  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or can be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have
not
recorded a deferred tax liability related to these undistributed historic earnings.
On
August 16, 2022,
the Inflation Reduction Act of
2022
was signed into law. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the recently enacted law, including whether we are subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. However, we do
not
expect the impact to be material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTINGENCIES
Litigation Matters
We are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of Beatrice Company ("Beatrice") in fiscal
1991,
including litigation proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition. These proceedings have included suits against a number of lead-based paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("ConAgra Grocery Products"), as alleged successor to W. P. Fuller & Co., a lead-based paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to Beatrice from
1962
until
1967.
These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injury, property damage, economic loss, and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of lead-based paint, and/or injunctive relief for inspection and abatement. When such lawsuits have been brought, ConAgra Grocery Products has denied liability, both on the merits of the claims and on the basis that we do
not
believe it to be the successor to any liability attributable to W. P. Fuller & Co. In the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
one
of these lawsuits in Illinois was resolved through a final judgment in favor of ConAgra Grocery Products. Pursuant to the settlement of a consolidated lead-based paint and pigment related action in California in
2019,
ConAgra Grocery Products is responsible for payments totaling $ 101.7
million, payable in
seven
annual installments from fiscal
2020
through fiscal
2026,
of which $ 61.0  million had been paid as of
November 27, 2022.
As part of the settlement, ConAgra Grocery Products has also provided a guarantee of up to $ 15.0
million in the event co-defendant, NL Industries, Inc., defaults on its payment obligations. We had accrued $ 11.4  million and $ 29.1  million, within other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, for this matter as of
November 27, 2022.
We are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the Company's product labeling. These matters include
Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc . , a class action lawsuit, in which it is alleged that the labeling for
Wesson ®
oils as
100%
natural is false and misleading because the oils contain genetically modified plants and organisms. On
November 15, 2022,
the trial court granted preliminary approval of a $ 3.0
million settlement pursuant to which the Company paid the total amount into a settlement fund on
December 9, 2022.
We are party to matters challenging the Company's wage and hour practices. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, we do
not
expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.
We are party to a number of matters asserting product liability claims against the Company related to certain
Pam ®
and other cooking spray products. These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety warnings of the cooking spray products. We have put the Company's insurance carriers on notice. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, we do
not
expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.

Environmental Matters
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $ 1.0
million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required.
In
October 2019,
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") initiated an odor complaint investigation at our Waseca, Minnesota vegetable processing facility. As a result of the investigation, the MPCA required implementation of a continuous monitoring system running from
May 1
to
October 31
in
2020
and
2021
and from
April 1
to
October 31
in
2022
to monitor hydrogen sulfide emissions at the wastewater treatment facility. As a result of the monitoring data findings, the MPCA has alleged violations of Minnesota Ambient Air Quality Standards based on our hydrogen sulfide emissions during calendar years
2020,
2021,
and
2022.
The MPCA's current proposed penalty is $ 1.8
million for
2020
and $ 4.3
million for
2021;
however, we are still in settlement negotiations with the MPCA to reduce the amount allegedly owed. Additionally, we are taking actions to improve wastewater treatment at the Waseca facility, which actions
may
be considered to offset portions of the penalties ultimately agreed upon by the parties.
We are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition in fiscal
1991,
including litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately
35  Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the "Beatrice sites"). The Beatrice sites consist of locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled $ 39.2  million ($ 2.0  million within other accrued liabilities and $ 37.2  million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of
November 27, 2022 , a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above.
Guarantees and Other Contingencies
In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. As of
November 27, 2022,
we continued to guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business (the "Spinoff"), remained in place following completion of the Spinoff, and will remain in place until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of
November 8, 2016 ( the "Separation Agreement"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, under the Separation Agreement, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us. Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a
third
party for certain farmland through
2025
(subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for
one
additional
five -year period). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed to the sublessor Lamb Weston's performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $ 75.0
million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the Company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guarantee, would be largely mitigated.
We also guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of
November 27, 2022 , the remaining term of this arrangement did
not
exceed
four  years and the maximum amount of guaranteed future payments was $ 10.0  million.
General
After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should
not
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters
may
occur in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Costs of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized within SG&A expenses as services are provided.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have defined benefit retirement plans ("pension plans") for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits to qualifying U.S. employees.
Components of pension and postretirement plan costs (benefits) are:

The Company uses a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost.
17
Table of Contents
The weighted-average discount rates for service and interest costs under the spot-rate approach used for pension cost in fiscal
2023  were
4.74 % and
4.09 %, respectively.
During the
second  quarter and
first
half of fiscal
2023,
we contributed $ 2.9  million and $ 5.9  million, respectively, to our pension plans and contributed $ 1.7  million and $ 3.6  million, respectively, to our postretirement plans. Based upon the current funded status of the plans and the current interest rate environment, we anticipate making further contributions of approximately $ 6.5  million to our pension plans during the remainder of fiscal
2023.
We anticipate making further contributions of approximately $ 4.5  million to our postretirement plans during the remainder of fiscal
2023.
These estimates are based on ERISA guidelines, current tax laws, plan asset performance, and liability assumptions, which are subject to change.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance establishes a
three -level fair value hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or liabilities. The
three
levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
Level
1  — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,
Level  2  — Observable inputs other than those included in Level
1,
such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and
Level  3  — Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The fair values of our Level
2
derivative instruments were determined using valuation models that use market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level
2
primarily represent commodity and foreign currency option and forward contracts.
Our Level
3
available-for-sale debt securities consist of a convertible note receivable acquired in the
second
quarter of fiscal
2022.
The convertible note receivable is
not
traded in active markets and the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model.
The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of
November 27, 2022 :

Certain assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level
3
inputs.
In the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we recognized a charge for the impairment of an indefinite-lived brand of $ 244.0
million in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. The fair value of this brand was estimated using the "relief from royalty" method (see Note
4 ).
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
goodwill impairment charges totaling $ 141.7
million were recognized within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment.  The impairments were measured using a discounted cash flow valuation model specific to the Sides, Components and Enhancers reporting unit (see Note
4 ).
In the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we recognized impairment charges totaling $ 0.5
million in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $ 5.7
million in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $ 20.5
million in our Foodservice segment. In the
second
quarter of fiscal
2022,
we recognized impairment charges totaling $ 22.4  million in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $ 12.0  million in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $ 4.8  million in our Foodservice segment. The impairments were measured based upon the estimated sales price of a disposal group that
no
longer meets the held for sale criteria as of the
second
quarter of fiscal
2023  (see Note
1 ).
The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $ 9.04  billion and $ 8.80
billion as of
November 27, 2022
and
May 29, 2022 , respectively. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt (level
2
liabilities) at
November 27, 2022
and
May 29, 2022 , was estimated at $ 8.79  billion and $ 8.85
billion, respectively.

To be consistent with the manner in which we present certain disaggregated net sales information to investors, we have categorized certain net sales of our segments as "Staples", which includes all of our U.S. domestic retail refrigerated products and other shelf-stable grocery products. Management continues to regularly review financial results and make decisions about allocating resources based upon the
four
reporting segments outlined above.
Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are
not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.
The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:

As of
November 27, 2022 , the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and
not
yet allocated to reporting segments was $ 14.0  million. This amount reflected net gains of $ 13.6  million incurred during the  twenty-six
weeks ended
November 27, 2022
and net gains of $ 0.4  million incurred prior to fiscal
2023.
Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $ 11.0  million in fiscal
2023  and gains of $ 3.0  million in fiscal
2024  and thereafter.

Assets by Segment
The majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used by each reporting segment can change over time. Also, working capital balances are
not
tracked by reporting segment. Therefore, it is impracticable to allocate those assets to the reporting segments, as well as disclose total assets by segment. Total depreciation expense was $ 77.8  million and $ 156.0
million for the
second
quarter and
first
half of fiscal
2023,  respectively.  Total depreciation expense was $ 82.2  million and $ 163.8  million for the

Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Results
In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, results reflected an increase in net sales, with organic (excludes the impact of foreign exchange) increases in all of our segments, in each case compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Overall gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher net sales, productivity, and lower transportation costs, which were offset by input cost inflation, unfavorable operating leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. Overall segment operating profit increased in our Refrigerated & Frozen, Grocery & Snacks, and Foodservice segments, which was partially offset by a slight decrease in our International segment. Corporate expenses were higher primarily due to higher share-based payment expense. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were also impacted by higher advertising and promotion expenses offset by other items impacting comparability as discussed below. We recognized higher equity method investment earnings, higher interest expense, and higher income tax expense, in each case compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was slightly higher compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $0.79 and $0.57, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was affected by higher net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Trends Impacting Our Business
During fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, labor issues, input cost inflation, and other global macroeconomic challenges. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, while we continued to experience significant input cost inflation, our supply chain productivity and pricing actions assisted in a 316-basis point improvement to gross margin. We expect input cost inflation to remain elevated throughout the rest of fiscal 2023, but anticipate continued supply chain productivity and pricing actions to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures. As our estimates of inflation for fiscal 2023 continue to change, it is impractical to quantify the ultimate impact at this time. As we approach our annual goodwill and brand impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, continued increases to interest rates coupled with the uncertainty in the inflationary environment creates a heightened risk for future impairments later in the fiscal year.
We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets, supply chains, commodity costs, the labor environment and aspects of our business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we continued to experience elevated demand for our products in the retail segments versus pre-pandemic levels, but volumes were lower compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to the elasticity impact from our inflation-driven pricing actions. We experienced higher demand for our foodservice products across all of our major markets during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as consumer traffic in away-from-home food outlets continues to be strong, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We expect these trends to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023.
We also continue to expect recovery from the higher costs we experienced in fiscal 2021 and which continued to rise in fiscal 2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect a decrease in supply chain operating costs during the second half of fiscal 2023 as we continue to recover our service levels. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
Although we are a North American focused company with no operations in or direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine, starting in the second half of fiscal 2022, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. To date, however, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or result of operations.

Restructuring Plans
In fiscal 2019, senior management initiated a restructuring plan for costs incurred in connection with actions taken to improve SG&A expense effectiveness and efficiencies and to optimize our supply chain network (the "Conagra Restructuring Plan"). Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire Conagra Restructuring Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of November 27, 2022, we had approved the incurrence of $184.0 million ($57.2 million of cash charges and $126.8 million of non-cash charges) for several projects associated with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. As of November 27, 2022, we had incurred or expected to incur $152.6 million of charges ($50.7 million of cash charges and $101.9 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the Conagra Restructuring Plan. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized charges of $1.8 million and $6.6 million, respectively, in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. In the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized charges of $5.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, in connection with this plan. We expect to incur costs related to the Conagra Restructuring Plan over a multi-year period.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we had substantially completed our Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan related to our acquisition of Pinnacle in 2018 for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies (the "Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan"). In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized charges of $5.8 million in connection with the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan. In the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized charges of $0.8 million and $13.1 million, respectively, in connection with this plan. Our total pre-tax expenses for this plan related to our continuing operations are expected to be $344.8 million ($283.6 million of cash charges and $61.2 million of non-cash charges).
SEGMENT REVIEW
We reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.
Grocery & Snacks
The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.
Refrigerated & Frozen
The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.
International
The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.
Foodservice
The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.
Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately. See Note 14  "Business Segments and Related Information" , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further discussion.

Operating profit in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment for the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $100.4 million compared to the first half of fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by the net sales growth discussed above, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. The increase in gross profits was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, excluding items impacting comparability, as discussed above, including increased advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2023 included charges of $385.7 million related to the goodwill and
Bird s Eye ®
brand impairments in connection with certain reporting unit changes within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment and charges of $7.9 million associated with a fire occurring at one of our manufacturing facilities. Operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 included charges of $5.7 million and $12.0 million, respectively, related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by net expense of $1.4 million and $11.8 million related to our restructuring plans in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Operating profit in our International segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 reflected flat gross profits when compared to the prior-year period. Operating profit in our International segment for the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected a decrease in gross profits of $6.5 million when compared to the prior-year period due to the impacts of input cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost leverage.

Operating profit in our Foodservice segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $10.8 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit was driven by the net sales growth discussed above, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost leverage. Operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 included expense of $4.8 million related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale.
Operating profit in our Foodservice segment for the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $12.2 million compared to the first half of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit was driven by the net sales growth discussed above, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. Operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 included expense of $20.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale.
Pension and Postretirement Non-service Income
In the second quart er of fiscal
2023 , pension and postretirement non-service income was  $6.1
million,  a decrease
of  $10.0
million compared to the
second
quarter of fiscal  2022 . In
the first half fiscal 2023, pension and postretirement non-service income was $12.2 million, a decrease of $20.0 compared to the first half of fiscal 2022.  The
second
quarter and
first half  of fiscal
2023
reflected higher interest costs.
Interest Expense, Net
Net interest expense was $100.3 million and $94.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net interest expense was $197.4 million and $189.1 million for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was driven by
a higher weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt.
See Note 3,
"Debt and Revolving Credit Facility" , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further discussion.
Income Taxes
In the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $122.5 million and $84.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 24.3% and 23.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $136.9 million and $153.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 31.0% and 23.1% for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2023 was principally impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairments noted above. See Note 9,
"Income Taxes" , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates.
Equity Method Investment Earnings
Equity method investment earnings were $49.3 million and $29.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity method investment earnings were $98.5 million and $49.7 million for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ardent Mills earnings for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2023 reflected favorable market conditions, including the joint venture's effective management through the recent volatility in the wheat markets.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $0.79 and $0.57, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $0.63 and $1.06, respectively. The increase in diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 reflected higher net income. The decrease in diluted earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected lower net income and was largely impacted by the goodwill and brand impairment charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of Liquidity and Capital
The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We are committed to maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings.
Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter.
Borrowing Facilities and Long-Term Debt
At November 27, 2022, we had a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2.0 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion with the consent of the lenders). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The Company may request the term of the Revolving Credit Facility be extended for additional one-year or two-year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of November 27, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of November 27, 2022, we had $254.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of borrowings during the first half of fiscal 2023 was $452.0 million. We had $180.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of May 29, 2022.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into an unsecured Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Term Loan Agreement provided for delayed draw term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. The Term Loan Agreement matures on August 26, 2025. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we borrowed the full $500.0 million aggregate principal amount available under the Term Loan Agreement. The proceeds were used to repay the full outstanding $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.25% senior notes on their maturity date of September 15, 2022 as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.
For additional information about our long-term debt balances, refer to Note 3,
"Debt and Revolving Credit Facility" , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report and Note 3,
"Long-Term Debt" , to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022. The weighted average coupon interest rate of long-term debt obligations outstanding as of November 27, 2022, was approximately 4.4%.
We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance long-term debt at maturity or otherwise, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, access to the capital markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility. We continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt; however, any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors, including financing options that may be available to us from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all.

Table of Contents
As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible.
Our most restrictive debt agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded net debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.75 to 1.0 through the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 4.5 to 1.0 for each quarter thereafter. Each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of November 27, 2022, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
Equity and Dividends
We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of $150.0 million. The Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of November 27, 2022 was $916.6 million.
On December 1, 2022, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its
common stock of $0.33 per share to stockholders of record as of close of business on November 3, 2022.
On December 21, 2022, our Board announced a quarterly dividend payment of $0.33 per share to be paid on March 2, 2023, to stockholders of record as of close of business on January 30, 2023.
Contractual Obligations
As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, discussed above, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and unconditional purchase obligations.
As of November 27, 2022, our finance and operating lease liabilities reported in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $118.8 million and $248.7 million, respectively. We have entered into contracts that are or contain a lease that have not yet commenced with aggregate payments totaling
$269.6 million,
as of November 27, 2022. For additional information, refer to Note 14,
"Leases" , to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.
The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was $29.7 million as of November 27, 2022. For additional information, refer to Note 9,
"Income Taxes" , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report and Note 13,
"Pre-Tax Income and Income Taxes" , to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.
As of May 29, 2022, we had an aggregate funded pension asset of $162.1 million and an aggregate unfunded postretirement benefit obligation totaling $61.4 million. We expect to make payments totaling approximately $12.4 million and $8.1 million in fiscal 2023 to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively. See Note 11  "Pension and Postretirement Benefits",
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report and Note 17,
"Pension and Postretirement Benefits" , to the Consolidated Financial Statements and
"Critical Accounting Estimates
–
Employee-Related Benefits"
contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, for further discussion of our pension obligation and factors that could affect estimates of these obligations.
As of November 27, 2022, our unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts) totaled approximately $2.84 billion. Approximately $1.93 billion
of this balance is due in less than one year. Included in this amount are open purchase orders and other supply agreements totaling approximately $1.73 billion, which are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business. Some are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. Warehousing service agreements totaling approximately
$626 million make up a majority of our remaining unconditional purchase obligations with various terms of up to 1 0 years.
We expect to have sufficient cash flows from the above cited sources to meet the material cash requirements of these contractual obligations as they become settleable in the ordinary course of business.

Table of Contents
Capital Expenditures
We continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 is approximately $425 million.
Supplier Arrangements
Certain suppliers have access to third-party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. These third-party services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. Balances remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements and are either reflected in accounts payable or in notes payable within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on the nature of the arrangement. The associated payments are included in net cash flows from operating activities for those balances reflected in accounts payable, whereas the proceeds and payments associated with short-term borrowings are reflected as financing activities within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022,
$386.8 million
and $378.3 million, respectively, of our total accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-party services. As of November 27, 2022, we also had approximately $109.2 million of short-term borrowings related to these arrangements.
The program commenced at about the same time that we began an initiative to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. A number of factors may impact our future payment terms, including our relative creditworthiness, overall market liquidity, and changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions.
Cash Flows
During the first half of fiscal 2023, we used $43.6 million of cash, which was the net result of $297.8 million generated from operating activities, $181.9 million used in investing activities, $157.4 million used in financing activities, and a decrease of $2.1 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Cash generated from operating activities totaled $297.8 million and $262.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows for the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to the first half of fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher gross profits and the accelerated receipt of our outstanding receivables. In the first half of fiscal 2023, we utilized certain customer payment term offerings to accelerate receipt on our outstanding receivables in exchange for a slightly higher prompt pay discount, which increased our cash flow from operations by approximately $152 million. This was partially offset by higher inventory balances, largely due to input cost inflation and some inventory rebuild from previous supply chain constraints, and timing of payments of accounts payable.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $181.9 million and $244.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash outflows from investing activities in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling $188.4 million and $257.5 million, respectively.
Cash used in financing activities totaled $157.4 million and $23.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2023 principally reflected repayments of long-term debt of $265.8 million, the issuance of long-term debt totaling $500.0 million, net short-term borrowing issuances of $75.4 million, cash dividends paid of $308.6 million, and common stock repurchases of $150.0 million. Financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2022 principally reflected net proceeds of $499.1 million from the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, net short-term borrowing repayments of $121.6 million, cash dividends paid of $282.0 million, and common stock repurchases of $50.0 million.
Cash Held by International Subsidiaries
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $39.7 million at November 27, 2022 and $83.3 million at May 29, 2022, of which $32.8 million at November 27, 2022, and $74.7 million at May 29, 2022 was held in foreign countries. A deferred tax liability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal 2023 that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Other undistributed foreign earnings are invested indefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those earnings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
For further discussion of our critical accounting estimates, please refer to the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
section in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.
ITEM   3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The principal market risks affecting us are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies.
Other than the changes noted below, there have been no material changes in our market risk during the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022. For additional information, refer to the
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"
section in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.
Commodity Market Risk
We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions.
Interest Rate Risk
We may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt.
The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $9.04 billion as of November 27, 2022. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt at November 27, 2022 was estimated at $8.79 billion. As of November 27, 2022, a 1% increase in the interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $428.2 million, while a 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $482.3 million.
Foreign Currency Risk
In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and foreign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions):

It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.

The Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase shares of its common stock in December 2003, which share repurchase authorization has been subsequently increased from time to time. On June 27, 2018, we announced that the Board increased the amount of the share repurchase authorization by $1.0 billion. As of November 27, 2022, approximately $916.6 million of our common stock remained available for purchase under this authorization, which has no expiration. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.
