STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Basis of Financial Statements
STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive access control products including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, passive entry passive start systems (PEPS), steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding door systems, power tailgate systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, door handles and related products for primarily North American automotive customers. We also supply global automotive manufacturers through a unique strategic relationship with WITTE Automotive (“WITTE”) of Velbert, Germany, and ADAC Automotive (“ADAC”) of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Under this relationship, STRATTEC, WITTE and ADAC market the products of each company to global customers under the “VAST Automotive Group” brand name (as more fully described herein). STRATTEC products are shipped to customer locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, Korea, China and India, and we, along with our VAST LLC partners, provide full service and aftermarket support for each VAST Automotive Group partner’s products. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated results of STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION, its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, STRATTEC de Mexico, and its majority owned subsidiaries, ADAC-STRATTEC, LLC and STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC. STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. STRATTEC de Mexico is located in Juarez, Mexico. ADAC-STRATTEC, LLC and STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC have operations in El Paso, Texas and Juarez and Leon, Mexico. Equity investments in Vehicle Access Systems Technology LLC (“VAST LLC”), for which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not variable interest entities of STRATTEC, are accounted for using the equity method. VAST LLC consists primarily of
four
wholly owned subsidiaries in China,
one
wholly owned subsidiary in Brazil and
one
joint venture entity in India. The results of the VAST LLC foreign subsidiaries and joint venture are reported on a one-month lag basis. We have only
one
reporting segment.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2023 and July 3, 2022, which have been derived from our audited financial statements, and the related unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 8, 2022. During December 2022, management determined that a previously unrecorded liability for postretirement death benefits is required to be recognized in accordance with ASC 715. Eligible participants for this death benefit include all salaried retirees who retired prior to October 1, 2001 and all hourly retirees who were hired prior to June 27, 2005 and retired prior to January 1, 2010. As such, the actuarially calculated liability and the unrecognized actuarial losses impacting Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses will be reported in the in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
Additionally, management identified a correction to previously reported Equity Earnings of Joint Ventures in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income, which correction also impacts the previously reported Investment in Joint Ventures amount reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. While prior period amounts have been corrected for comparability, the corrections, both individually and in total, were not material to the previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements.

The correction of prior period amounts had no impact on total operating, investing, and financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows during the six month period ended December 26, 2021. In conjunction with the correction of the prior period amounts, the following footnotes, which were impacted by the above adjustments, were also corrected: Shareholders’ Equity, Other Income (Expense), net, Earnings Per Share, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.
Risks and Uncertainties In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus subsequently spread, and infections occurred in multiple countries around the world, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the global spread of the disease, the severity of illnesses it causes and its effects on society. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, and in certain cases, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes or from participating in large group gatherings. Accordingly, the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the recent conflict in the Ukraine, has severely restricted the level of economic activity in many countries, and continues to adversely impact global economic activity, including with respect to customer purchasing actions and supply chain continuity and disruption, and in particular the supply of semiconductor chips, transponders and related components to the automotive industry.     8
STRATTEC’s operating performance is subject to global economic conditions, inflationary pressures and levels of consumer spending specifically within the automotive industry and its operating performance has been impacted by the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in the Ukraine, all as described above. During the period from late March 2020 through mid-June 2020, the majority of our OEM customer assembly plant operations were completely closed including most of the supply chain. Additionally, during most of this same period, STRATTEC’s Mexico facilities were closed as a result of the Mexican government’s shutdown of non-essential businesses. Re-opening of our OEM customer facilities and our Mexico facilities began in June 2020, and the automotive industry continued to ramp-up throughout our fiscal year ended June 27, 2021. Nonetheless, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2021, our net sales were negatively impacted by a global semiconductor chip shortage (especially as it relates to the automotive industry), which shortage continued into our fiscal 2022. Although semiconductor chip availability improved during the first six months of our fiscal 2023 relative to our fiscal 2022, negative impacts of the shortage continue to affect STRATTEC, specifically as it pertains to aftermarket products, which trail the prioritization of production of components for production vehicles in the allocation of semiconductor chips. Additionally, inflationary pressures resulted in increased raw material and purchased part costs as well as higher labor costs associated with mandatory minimum wage increases in Mexico beginning in calendar 2021. Such increases negatively impacted our operating results in our fiscal 2022 and continued to escalate during the first six months of our fiscal 2023.   Each of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ukraine conflict and the resulting inflationary pressures in the U.S. and global economy, which have adversely impacted, and continue to do so, pricing conditions for necessary raw materials and purchased components in our products, continue to adversely impact our operating results due mostly to the supply chain continuity and disruption issues noted above, and in particular related to the supply of semiconductor chips, transponders and related components to our customers in the automotive industry. The extent of such impacts, including related to their duration and intensity, depends upon any continued spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the length of the Ukraine conflict, and related regulatory or operating restraints, which may be precautionary, imposed by local governments and the private sector and by any continuing inflationary pressures in the U.S. and global economies. All of these events may continue to impact the supply chain and our operations, including impacting our customers, workforce and suppliers, any of which may continue to disrupt and limit sourcing of semiconductor chips, transponders and other critical supply chain components needed by us and our customers to meet expected production schedules.
Moreover, these events may continue to create added inflationary pressures on our operations, including related to wages and the prices of raw materials and purchased parts.
All of these foregoing matters, including their scope and duration are uncertain and cannot be predicted as to timing and cost impacts. These changing conditions may also affect the estimates and assumptions made by our management in our financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, our long-lived asset valuations, equity investment valuation, assessment of our annual effective tax rate, valuation of deferred income taxes, assessment of excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and assessment of collectability of trade receivables.
New Accounting Standard In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial instruments – Credit Losses . This update revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. Originally, the update was effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10,
Financial instruments – Credit Losses, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and Leases . This ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for public companies that are considered smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are planning to adopt this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2024. We do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Subsequent Event Subsequent to January 1, 2023, the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility, as described under Credit Facilities, was amended such that effective with the first borrowing subsequent to February 6, 2023, interest on borrowings under the credit facility will be at varying rates based, at our option, on
Term SOFR plus
1.35
percent or the bank’s prime rate.
The amendment also modifies the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio and the required level of minimum net worth for all future periods under the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility. Refer to the discussion under Credit Facilities.

Derivative Instruments We own and operate manufacturing operations in Mexico. As a result, a portion of our manufacturing costs are incurred in Mexican pesos, which causes our earnings and cash flows to fluctuate due to changes in the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso exchange rate. We have contracts with Bank of Montreal that provide for monthly Mexican peso currency forward contracts for a portion of our estimated peso denominated operating costs. Our objective in entering into currency forward contracts from time to time is to minimize our earnings volatility resulting from changes in exchange rates affecting the U.S. dollar cost of our Mexican operations. The Mexican peso forward contracts are not used for speculative purposes and are not designated as hedges. As a result, all currency forward contracts are recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value and changes in the fair value are reported in current earnings as part of Other Income (Expense), net.
The following table quantifies the outstanding Mexican peso forward contracts as of January 1, 2023 (thousands of dollars, except with respect to the average forward contractual exchange rate):

Leases We have an operating lease for our El Paso, Texas finished goods and service parts distribution warehouse that has a current lease term through
October 2023 . This lease includes renewal terms that can
extend
the lease term for
five
additional years. For purposes of calculating operating lease obligations, we included the option to extend the lease as it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. The lease does not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As the lease does not provide an implicit rate, we used our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of our lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest we would pay to borrow over a similar term with similar payments.

Credit Facilities STRATTEC has a $ 40
million secured revolving credit facility (the “STRATTEC Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. ADAC-STRATTEC LLC has a $ 25
million secured revolving credit facility (the “ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A., which is guaranteed by STRATTEC. The credit facilities both expire
August 1, 2024 . Borrowings under either credit facility are secured by our U.S. cash balances, accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. Interest on borrowings under both credit facilities were at varying rates based, at our option, on
LIBOR plus
1.25
percent or the bank’s prime rate.
Both credit facilities contain a restrictive financial covenant that requires the applicable borrower to maintain a minimum net worth level. The ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility includes an additional restrictive financial covenant that requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Subsequent to January 1, 2023, a waiver was received from BMO Harris Bank N.A. related to non-compliance with the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility fixed charge coverage ratio as of January 1, 2023. Furthermore, subsequent to January 1, 2023, the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility was amended to modify the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum level of net worth for all future periods such that it is probable ADAC-STRATTEC will comply with the amended covenant in future periods. As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all other financial covenants required by these credit facilities.

Commitments and Contingencies
We are from time to time subject to various legal actions and claims incidental to our business, including those arising out of alleged defects, alleged breaches of contracts, product warranties, intellectual property matters and employment related matters. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. With respect to warranty matters, although we cannot ensure that future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material, we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements. 14
In 1995, we recorded a provision for estimated costs to remediate an environmental contamination site at our Milwaukee facility. The facility was contaminated by a solvent spill, which occurred in 1985, from a former above ground solvent storage tank located on the east side of the facility. The reserve was originally established based on third party estimates to adequately cover the cost for active remediation of the contamination. Due to changing technology and related costs associated with active remediation of the contamination, in fiscal years 2010, 2016, and 2021, we obtained updated third party estimates of projected costs to adequately cover the cost for active remediation of this contamination and adjusted the reserve as needed. We monitor and evaluate the site with the use of groundwater monitoring wells. An environmental consultant samples these wells one or two times a year to determine the status of the contamination and the potential for remediation of the contamination by natural attenuation, the dissipation of the contamination over time to concentrations below applicable standards. If such sampling evidences a sufficient degree of and trend toward natural attenuation of the contamination at the site, we may be able to obtain a closure letter from the regulatory authorities resolving the issue without the need for active remediation. If a sufficient degree and trend toward natural attenuation is not evidenced by sampling, a more active form of remediation beyond natural attenuation may be required. The sampling has not yet satisfied all of the requirements for closure by natural attenuation. As a result, sampling continues and the reserve remains at an amount to reflect our estimated cost of active remediation. The reserve is not measured on a discounted basis. We believe, based on findings-to-date and known environmental regulations, that the environmental reserve of $ 1.4
million at January 1, 2023 is adequate.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers We generate revenue from the production of parts sold to automotive and light-truck Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), or Tier 1 suppliers at the direction of the OEM, under long-term supply agreements supporting new vehicle production. Such agreements also require related production of service parts subsequent to the initial vehicle production periods. Additionally, we generate revenue from the production of parts sold in aftermarket service channels and to non-automotive commercial customers.
Contract Balances: We have no material contract assets or contract liabilities as of January 1, 2023 or July 3, 2022.

Other Income (Expense), net
Net other income (expense) included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income primarily included foreign currency transaction gains and losses, realized and unrealized gains or losses on our Mexican peso currency forward contracts, net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than the service cost component, related to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) and postretirement plans and Rabbi Trust gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulted from activity associated with foreign denominated assets held by our Mexican subsidiaries. We entered into the Mexican Peso currency forward contracts described above to minimize earnings volatility resulting from changes in exchange rates affecting the U.S. dollar cost of our Mexican operations. Unrealized gains and losses on the peso forward contracts recognized as a result of mark-to-market adjustments as of January 1, 2023 may or may not be realized in future periods, depending on the actual Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates experienced during the balance of the contract period. The Rabbi Trust assets fund our Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The investments held in this Trust are considered trading securities.

Warranty We have a warranty liability recorded related to our known and potential exposure to warranty claims in the event our products fail to perform as expected, and in the event we may be required to participate in the repair costs incurred by our customers for such products. The recorded liability balance involves judgement and estimates. Our liability estimate is based on analysis of historical warranty data as well as current trends and information, including our customers recent extension and /or expansion of their warranty programs. In recent fiscal periods, our largest customers have extended their warranty protection for their vehicles and have since demanded higher warranty cost sharing arrangements from their suppliers in their terms and conditions to purchase, including from STRATTEC. As additional information becomes available, actual results may differ from recorded estimates, which may require us to adjust the amount of our warranty provision.
During the quarter ended January 1, 2023, we received notice that a product we shipped failed to perform as the customer expected. While it is probable we will incur costs related to this matter, it is not possible to reasonably estimate those costs based on limited information available, including uncertainty as to STRATTEC's responsibility and the responsibility of STRATTEC's supplier in the matter, as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. As additional information related to this matter becomes available, we may need to record additional warranty provisions.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was
40.8 % and
6.2 % for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rate was
40.7 % and
6.7 % for the six month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively. The increased effective tax rate in the current year three and six month periods was due to the impact of available R&D and foreign tax credits on projected pre-tax book losses for the fiscal year. The reduced
effective tax rate for the prior year three and six month periods was due to an increase in our foreign tax credits in the prior year periods as compared to the current year periods. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the application of the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax provisions, our available R&D tax credit and the non-controlling interest portion of our pre-tax income. The non-controlling interest portion impacts the effective tax rate as ADAC-STRATTEC LLC and STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC entities are taxed as partnerships for U.S. tax purposes.
(Loss) Earnings Per Share Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the applicable period using the treasury stock method. Potential dilutive common shares include outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock awards.

Stock-based Compensation
We maintain an omnibus stock incentive plan. This plan provides for the granting of stock options, shares of restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. As of January 1, 2023, the Board of Directors had designated
2
million shares of common stock available for the grant of awards under the plan. Remaining shares available to be granted under the plan as of January 1, 2023 were
129,359 . Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares become available for re-issuance under the plan. We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Nonqualified and incentive stock options and shares of restricted stock have been granted to our officers, outside directors and specified associates under our stock incentive plan. Stock options granted under the plan may not be issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted. Stock options become exercisable as determined at the date of grant by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The options expire
10
years after the grant date unless an earlier expiration date is set at the time of grant. The options vest
1
to
4 years
after the date of grant as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares of restricted stock granted under the plan are subject to vesting criteria determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time the shares are granted and have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant. Unvested restricted shares granted have voting rights, regardless of whether the shares are vested or unvested, but only have the right to receive cash dividends after such shares become vested. Restricted stock grants vest
1
to
3 years
after the date of grant as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value of each restricted stock grant was based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. The resulting compensation cost for fixed awards with graded vesting schedules is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.

As of January 1, 2023, all compensation cost related to outstanding stock options granted under our omnibus stock incentive plan has been recognized. As of January 1, 2023, there was approximately $ 1.9
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock grants outstanding under the plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of
1.1
years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated and actual forfeitures of awards granted under our omnibus stock incentive plan.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits
We have a noncontributory Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a nonqualified defined benefit plan. The SERP is funded through a Rabbi Trust with TMI Trust Company. Under the SERP, as amended December 31, 2013, participants received an accrued lump-sum benefit as of December 31, 2013, which was credited to each participant’s account. Subsequent to December 31, 2013, each eligible participant receives a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the foregoing lump sum benefit, plus an annual benefit accrual equal to
8
percent of the participant’s base salary and cash bonus, plus annual credited interest on the participant’s account balance. All then current participants as of December 31, 2013 are fully vested in their account balances with any new individuals participating in the SERP effective on or after January 1, 2014 being subject to a
five year
vesting period. The SERP, which is considered a nonqualified defined benefit plan under applicable rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Code, will continue to be funded through use of a Rabbi Trust to hold investment assets to be used in part to fund any future required lump sum benefit payments to participants. The Rabbi Trust assets had a value of $ 3.3
million at both January 1, 2023 and at July 3, 2022. At both January 1, 2023 and July 3, 2022, $ 863,000
of the Rabbi Trust asset balance was included in Other Current Assets and the remaining balance was included in Other Long-Term Assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also sponsor a postretirement health care plan for all current and future eligible U.S. retirees hired prior to June 1, 2001. The expected cost of retiree health care benefits is recognized during the years the associates who are covered under the plan render service. Effective January 1, 2010, an amendment to the postretirement health care plan limited the benefit for future eligible retirees to $ 4,000
per plan year and the benefit is further subject to a maximum
five year
coverage period based on the associate’s retirement date and age. The postretirement health care plan is unfunded. Additionally, we sponsor a postretirement life plan for all U.S. salaried retirees who retired prior to October 1, 2001 and all U.S. hourly retirees who were hired prior to June 27, 2005 and retired prior to January 1, 2010. The benefit provides for a death benefit of $ 8,000 , which is increased to $ 70,000
for disability retirees until reaching the age of
65 , in which case the death benefit decreased to $ 8,000 . The postretirement life plan is unfunded. See "Basis of Financial Statements" above for additional information regarding certain matters related to recording a liability adjustment for the death benefit owed to eligible participants under the postretirement life plan. The service cost component of the net periodic benefit costs under these plans is allocated between Cost of Goods Sold and Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses while the remaining components of the net periodic benefit costs are included in Other Income (Expense), net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.

STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and its 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 8, 2022. Also, refer to discussion of prior period corrections under Basis of Financial Statements included in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to quarters and years refer to fiscal quarters and fiscal years.
Outlook
Refer to discussion of Risks and Uncertainties included in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 8 of this Form 10-Q.
Starting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 2020, the automotive industry has experienced significant volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in periods of shutdowns as well as a subsequent demand-led production recovery. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we were impacted by supply chain shortages in the automotive supply chain of critical electronic component parts, primarily semiconductor chips, and certain raw materials which impacted the production schedules for our customers and, therefore, our production levels and have, in turn, adversely impacted pricing for raw materials and purchased components. These shortages continued throughout our fiscal 2022, which resulted in some of our customers temporarily closing several of their assembly plants or reducing their production schedules in North America.
While supply chain shortages improved in the first half of fiscal year 2023 relative to the prior year period, they continued to constrain a full return to demand-driven production levels mainly affecting the recovery of our aftermarket product sales and, moreover, adverse inflationary pricing and wage conditions have persisted in spite of improvements in the supply chain. The sales outlook from our customers over the remainder of fiscal year 2023 projects a stable sales environment with potential for modest growth.
However, this sales outlook is contingent on continued progress toward stability for supply chains post COVID-19 pandemic, and minimal disruption of the North American and overall global economy due to higher inflation and interest rates and the economic implications from the conflict in the Ukraine and other international political unrest.
From a gross profit margin perspective, we anticipate continued inflationary pressures from the cost of raw materials, purchased materials and labor for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.
Seeking pricing recovery from our customers for such inflationary costs is an immediate and prime focus of ours, however, given the long-term nature of our supply agreements, such negotiations are not customary and therefore, have outcomes that are difficult to predict.

Overall net sales were stable for the current quarter relative to the prior year quarter.
The following items specifically impacted sales to the above noted customer groups between
quarters:
- Sales to General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company and Hyundai/Kia were positively impacted in the current year quarter due to higher vehicle production volumes resulting from improved global semiconductor chip availability relative to the prior year quarter.
Sales growth to General Motors Company in the current year quarter was attributed to higher production volumes of their GMC and Chevrolet pickup trucks and certain SUVs for which we supply a wide range of components. Sales to Hyundai / Kia increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher levels of production of the Kia Carnival minivan in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.
- The decrease in sales to Stellantis between quarters resulted primarily from its plant shutdowns in the current year quarter, which reduced production volumes compared to the prior year quarter.
- Sales to Commercial and Other OEM Customers, which are comprised of aftermarket products and vehicle access control products, such as latches, fobs, driver controls and door handles, declined in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter due to continued semiconductor chip availability issues, primarily for aftermarket keys. The increases in availability of semiconductor chips were allocated toward the production of components for production vehicles ahead of aftermarket products and, therefore, sales to aftermarket customers continued to be negatively impacted in the current year quarter due to these issues.

Despite relatively stable sales for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, the total cost of goods sold increased by $7.8 million between the two periods.
Both direct material costs and labor and overhead costs increased proportionately with the total cost of goods sold increase quarter-to-quarter, resulting in only minor changes in their respective percentage of cost of goods sold between quarters. The increase in direct material costs of $4.8 million between quarters was due to the continued trend of higher costs for raw material and purchased components in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.
Labor and overhead costs increased $3.0 million between quarters. Labor and overhead costs were impacted by the
following:
Cost Increases:
- Mexico wages and benefits increased $1.9 million in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter as a result of a January 1, 2022 government mandated minimum wage
increase.
- The U.S. dollar value of our Mexican operations was negatively impacted by approximately $1.1 million in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter due to an unfavorable Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate between quarterly periods. The average U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate decreased to approximately 19.57 pesos to the dollar in the current year quarter from approximately 20.89 pesos to the dollar in the prior year quarter.
- Freight costs increased $800,000 between quarterly periods due to an increase in fuel costs and supply chain disruptions.
Cost Decrease:
- Royalty costs paid on sales of certain aftermarket products decreased $570,000 in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter due to lower volumes in these aftermarket products stemming from the current semiconductor chip shortage.
- Production efficiencies that controlled headcount at our Mexico facilities resulted in reduced labor and benefit costs between quarterly periods of approximately $500,000.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses in the current year quarter increased in comparison to the prior year quarter primarily due to increased salary and recruiting costs in the current year quarter and lower costs in the prior year quarter due to a customer reimbursement of engineering and design costs incurred on a new program.
Loss from operations was $4.7 million in the current year quarter compared to income from operations of $3.6 million in the prior year quarter due a reduction in gross profit margin dollars and higher engineering, selling and administrative expenses between quarters, all as discussed above.
The equity earnings of joint ventures was $588,000 in the current year quarter compared to $615,000 in the prior year quarter. The slightly lower equity earnings between quarters was primarily due to higher engineering spending in China associated with future programs. We currently believe a presence in the China market is a key component of our global strategy. We anticipate that it will contribute to our overall long-term market and financial strength as the China market continues to expand and as it seeks to rebound from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting supply chain shortages of critical electronic component parts. Due to our limited amount of business in both India and Brazil as well as the impact of COVID-19 and the global semiconductor chip shortage described above, our VAST LLC joint venture in India continues to have break-even operating results and our VAST LLC joint venture in Brazil continues to report losses.

- Foreign currency transaction losses and gains resulted from activity associated with foreign denominated assets held by our Mexican subsidiaries.
- The Rabbi Trust assets fund our amended and restated supplemental executive retirement plan. The investments held in the Trust are considered trading securities.
- We entered into the Mexican peso currency forward contracts during fiscal 2023 and 2022 to minimize earnings volatility resulting from changes in exchange rates affecting the U.S. dollar cost of our Mexican operations. Unrealized gains and losses on the peso forward contracts recognized as a result of mark-to-market adjustments as of January 1, 2023 may or may not be realized in future periods, depending on actual Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates experienced during the balance of the contract period.
- Pension and postretirement plan costs include the components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component.
Our effective tax rate was 40.8% and 6.2% for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively. The increased effective tax rate in the current year period was due to the impact of available R&D and foreign tax credits on projected pre-tax book losses for the fiscal year. The prior year period effective tax rate was reduced due to an increase in our foreign tax credits in the prior year period as compared to the current year period. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the application of the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax provisions, our available R&D tax credit and the non-controlling interest portion of our pre-tax income. The non-controlling interest portion impacts the effective tax rate as ADAC-STRATTEC LLC and STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC entities are taxed as partnerships for U.S. tax purposes.

Overall, the period-over-period sales increase was due to improved global semiconductor chip availability in the current year period relative to the prior year period. The following items specifically impacted sales to the above noted customer groups between
periods:
- Sales to General Motors Company and Ford Motor Company were positively impacted in the current year period due to higher vehicle production volumes resulting from improved global semiconductor chip availability relative to the prior year period. Specifically, sales growth to General Motors Company and Ford Motor Company in the current year period was attributed to higher production volumes of their GMC and Chevrolet pickup trucks and certain SUVs for which we supply a wide range of components.
- The decrease in net sales to at Stellantis was driven primarily by its plant shutdowns which resulted in decreased production volumes in the current year compared to the prior year especially as it related to the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, the Jeep Compass and the Dodge Ram pickup truck.
- Sales to Tier 1 Customers improved in the current year period compared to the prior year period due to higher vehicle production volumes relating to the semiconductor chip availability referenced above.
- Sales to Commercial and Other OEM Customers, which are comprised of aftermarket products and vehicle access control products, such as latches, fobs, driver controls and door handles, declined in the current year period as compared to the prior year period due to continued semiconductor chip availability issues, primarily for aftermarket keys. The increases in availability of semiconductor chips were allocated toward the production of components for production vehicles ahead of aftermarket products and, therefore, sales to aftermarket customers continued to be negatively impacted in the current year period due to these issues.

The increase in direct material costs between periods was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales, higher costs for raw material and purchased components and a shift toward products with a higher proportion of material costs as a percent of their total cost of goods sold.
The increase in the proportion of direct material costs as a percent of total cost of goods sold between periods was due to its higher rate of growth compared with that for labor and overhead, which benefited from improved overhead absorption associated with higher sales between the periods, albeit partially mitigated by a reduction in inventory during the current year period.
Labor and overhead costs increased $6.8 million between periods. The variable portion of labor and overhead costs increased in the current year period commensurate with the production volume increase required to support the increased sales volumes compared to prior year period. However, this impact was partially offset by production efficiencies stemming from controlled headcount and overtime costs at our Milwaukee and Mexico facilities in the current year period. Labor and overhead costs were further impacted by the following:
26
Cost Increase:
- Mexico wages and benefits increased $3.3 million in the current year period as compared to the prior year period as a result of a January 1, 2022 government mandated minimum wage increase.
- Freight costs increased $1.6 million between year-to-date periods due to an increase in fuel costs and supply chain disruptions.
- The U.S. dollar value of our Mexican operations was negatively impacted by approximately $960,000 in the current year period as compared to the prior year period due to an unfavorable Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate between year-to-date periods. The average U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate decreased to approximately 19.88 pesos to the dollar in the current year period from approximately 20.44 pesos to the dollar in the prior year period.
Cost Decreases:
- Royalty costs paid on sales of certain aftermarket products decreased $1.0 million in the current year period as compared to the prior year period due to lower volumes in these aftermarket products stemming from the current semiconductor chip shortage.
- Prior year period costs included lump sum bonuses totaling $100,000 paid to our Milwaukee represented hourly workers upon the ratification of a new four-year labor contract, which contract is effective through November 1, 2025.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses in the current year period increased in comparison to the prior year period due to higher outside expenditures on new product development costs associated with utilizing third party vendors for a portion of our development work, an increase in engineering costs related to our ADAC-STRATTEC LLC door handle and exterior trim products, and increased salary and recruiting costs. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the increase in sales between periods as previously discussed.
Loss from operations was $4.9 million in the current year period compared to income from operations of $4.1 million in the prior year period due to the aforementioned reduction in gross profit margin dollars and an increase in engineering, selling and administrative expenses between periods.
The equity earnings of joint ventures was $1.1 million in the current year period compared to $364,000 in the prior year period. Improved profitability from our VAST LLC joint venture resulted from increased net sales and increased profitability in VAST China’s operations between periods. VAST China’s sales and profitability improvement in the current year period reflected an improved semiconductor chip availability environment compared with that of the prior year period.
We currently believe a presence in the China market is a key component of our global strategy.

Set forth below is a summary of the items impacting the change in our working capital requirements between year to date periods:
- Accounts receivable balances decreased in the current year period and increased in the prior year period. The current year period decrease was due to reduced sales during December 2022. The prior year period increase was the result of an increase in outstanding billings for customer owned tooling at December 2021.
- The change in inventory levels reflected a decrease in inventory balances during the current year period and an increase in inventory balances during the prior year period. The current year period decrease was due to a reduction in inventory balances to align with historical customer production patterns. The prior year period increase was due to an inventory build-up while our OEM customers experienced reduced production schedules due to certain part shortages, including semiconductor chips.
- The change in other assets includes an increase in balances during the current year period and a decrease in balances during the prior year period. The current year period increase is due to an increase in customer tooling balances and an increase in value added tax recoverable balances related to our operations in Mexico. Customer tooling balance changes result from the timing of tooling development spending required to meet customer production requirements and the timing of related customer billings for tooling cost reimbursement. Value added tax returns are filed and are pending settlement. The prior year decrease in other asset balances was the result of the receipt of a $3.2 million Federal tax refund.
- The change working capital requirements due to accounts payable and accrued liability balances was the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liability balances in the prior year period. The prior year period decrease resulted from the payment of fiscal 2021 accrued bonuses during August 2021, which payment totaled $6.6 million, and a decrease in accounts payable balances during the prior year period. The prior year period decrease in accounts payable balances reflected decreased purchases as of the end of December 2021 in conjunction with the management of our inventory balances. Accounts payable balances for each quarter reflected the timing of purchases and payments with our vendors based on normal, established payment terms.
Net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures made in support of requirements for new product programs and the upgrade and replacement of existing equipment of $9.5 million during the current year period and $5.4 million during the prior year period. Net cash used in investing activities in the current year period also included an investment in our VAST LLC joint venture of $104,000. The investment was made for the purpose of funding general expenses for Sistema Accesso Veicular Ltda, our Brazilian joint venture.
29
Net cash provided by financing activities during the current year period of $5.5 million included increased borrowings under our credit facilities of $9.0 million and $146,000 received for the exercise of stock options under our stock incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.0 million of repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities and $600,000 of dividend payments to non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries. Net cash provided by financing activities during the prior year period of $5.0 million included increased borrowings under our credit facilities of $8.0 million and $639,000 received for the exercise of stock options under our stock incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.0 million of repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities and $600,000 of dividend payments to non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries.
VAST LLC Cash Requirements
We currently anticipate that VAST China has adequate debt facilities in place over the remainder of our 2023 fiscal year to cover the future operating and capital requirements of its business. During the six-month period ended January 1, 2023, capital contributions totaling $312,000 were made to VAST LLC for purposes of funding operations in Brazil for the remainder of 2023 fiscal year. STRATTEC's portion of the capital contributions totaled $104,000. During the six month period ended December 26, 2021, no capital contributions were made to VAST LLC by any of the members. During the six months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, VAST LLC made no capital contributions to Minda-VAST Access Systems. We currently anticipate no required future capital contributions to Minda-VAST Access Systems over the remainder of our 2023 fiscal year.
Future Capital Expenditures
We anticipate total capital expenditures will be approximately $15.0 million to $17.0 million in fiscal 2023, of which $9.5 million has been made through January 1, 2023, in support of requirements for new product programs and the upgrade and replacement of existing equipment.
Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to buy back outstanding shares of our common stock. Shares authorized for buy back under the program totaled 3,839,395 at January 1, 2023. A total of 3,655,322 shares have been repurchased over the life of the program through January 1, 2023, at a cost of approximately $136.4 million. No shares were repurchased during the six month periods ended January 1, 2023 or December 26, 2021. Additional repurchases may occur from time to time and are expected to continue to be funded by cash flow from operations and current cash balances. Based on the current economic environment and our preference to conserve cash for other uses, we anticipate modest or no stock repurchase activity for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.
Credit Facilities
STRATTEC has a $40 million secured revolving credit facility (the “STRATTEC Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. ADAC-STRATTEC LLC has a $25 million secured revolving credit facility (the “ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A., which is guaranteed by STRATTEC. The credit facilities both expire August 1, 2024. Borrowings under either credit facility are secured by our U.S. cash balances, accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets located in the U.S. Interest on borrowings under both credit facilities were at varying rates based, at our option, on the LIBOR plus 1.25 percent or the bank’s prime rate. Both credit facilities contain a restrictive financial covenant that requires the applicable borrower to maintain a minimum net worth level. The ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility includes an additional restrictive financial covenant that requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Subsequent to January 1, 2023, a waiver was received from BMO Harris Bank N.A. related to non-compliance with the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility fixed charge coverage ratio as of January 1, 2023. Furthermore, subsequent to January 1, 2023, the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility was amended to modify the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum level of net worth for all future periods such that it is probable ADAC-STRATTEC will comply with the amended covenant in future periods. As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all other financial covenants required by these credit facilities. Outstanding borrowings under the STRATTEC Credit Facility totaled $4 million at January 1, 2023. There were no outstanding borrowings under the STRATTEC Credit Facility at July 3, 2022. The average outstanding borrowings and weighted average interest rate on the STRATTEC Credit Facility loans were approximately $3.1 million and 4.4 percent, respectively, during the six months ended January 1, 2023. Outstanding borrowings under the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility totaled $13 million at January 1, 2023 and $11 million at July 3, 2022. The average outstanding borrowings and weighted average interest rate on the ADAC-STRATTEC Credit Facility loans were approximately $11.9 million and 4.3 percent, respectively, during the six months ended January 1, 2023.

4 Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at reaching a level of reasonable assurance. It should be noted that in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reach a level of reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
