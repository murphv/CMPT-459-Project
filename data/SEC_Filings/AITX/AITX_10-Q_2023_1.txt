GENERAL INFORMATION
Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc.
(“AITX” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida on March 25, 2010 and reincorporated in Nevada on February
17, 2015. On August 24, 2018, Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc., changed its name from On the Move Systems Corp (“OMVS”).
Robotic Assistance Devices, LLC (“RAD”),
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2016 as a Limited Liability Company. On July 25, 2017, Robotic Assistance Devices
LLC converted to a C Corporation, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., through the issuance of
10,000
common shares to its sole shareholder.
On August 28, 2017, AITX completed the acquisition
of RAD (the “Acquisition”), whereby AITX acquired all the ownership and equity interest in RAD for
3,350,000
shares of AITX
Series E Preferred Stock and
2,450
shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. AITX’s prior business focus was transportation
services, and was exploring the on-demand logistics market by developing a network of logistics partnerships. As a result of the closing
of the Acquisition, AITX has succeeded to the business of RAD, and AITX’s business going forward will consist of one segment activity,
which is the delivery of artificial intelligence and robotic solutions for operational, security and monitoring needs.
The Acquisition was treated as a reverse recapitalization
effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since substantially all of AITX’s operations were disposed
of as part of the consummation of the transaction. Therefore, no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by AITX as a result
of the Acquisition. RAD is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control the Company after the Acquisition, even though
AITX was the legal acquirer.  As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial
statements are those of RAD as if RAD had always been the reporting company.

GOING CONCERN
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company
had negative cash flow from operating activities of $ 9,883,272 . As of November 30, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 107,074,465 ,
and negative working capital of $ 1,046,707 . Management does not anticipate having positive cash flow from operations in the near future.
These factors raise a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following
the issuance of these financial statements.
The Company does not have the resources at this time
to repay its credit and debt obligations, make any payments in the form of dividends to its shareholders or fully implement its business
plan. Without additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business.
Management has plans to address the Company’s
financial situation as follows:
In the near term, management plans to potentially
raise an additional $1 million to $3 million before the end of the fiscal year. Management is committed to raise either non-dilutive funds
or minimally dilutive funds. There is no assurance that these funds will be able to be raised nor can we provide assurance that these
possible raises may not have dilutive effects.
The Company began raising money through its S-3 Registration
Statement this year and made improvements in paying off debt, investing in inventory and at November 30, 2022 had $713,493 of cash on
hand. Management is committed to raise either non-dilutive funds or minimally dilutive funds. There is no assurance that these funds will
be able to be raised nor can we provide assurance that these possible raises may not have dilutive effects. For the fiscal period through
to November 30, 2022, the Company has raised an additional $4.7 million net of issuance costs through the sale of its common shares and
raised approximately $3.2 million in current debt.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)
and in conformity with the condensing instructions on Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X and the related rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto in the Company’s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K as filed on May 27, 2022. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Robotic Assistance
Devices, Inc., Robotic Assistance Devices Group , Inc, Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc., On the Move Experience, LLC and On the
OMV Transports, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for a fair presentation of such statements. The results of operations for the six months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
Use of Estimates
In order to prepare financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and determine whether contingent assets and liabilities, if any, are disclosed in the
financial statements. The ultimate resolution of issues requiring these estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from resolution
currently anticipated by management and on which the financial statements are based. The most significant estimates included in these
consolidated financial statements are those associated with the assumptions used to value preferred stock and derivative liabilities.
Concentrations
Loans payable
At November 30, 2022 there were $30,506,346 of loans
payable, $26,090,506 or 85% of these loans to companies controlled by one individual. At February 28, 2022 there were $26,233,598 of loans
payable $21,709,459 or 83% of these loans to companies controlled by the same individual.
Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks
and money market instruments. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality, U.S. financial institutions and, to
date has not experienced losses on any of its balances.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due
from customers, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated,
and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. There was an allowance of $ 109,890
and $ 33,890
provided as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively.
Device Parts Inventory
Device parts inventory is stated at the lower of cost
or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. The Company records a valuation reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory,
relying principally on specific identification of such inventory. The Company uses these device parts in the assembly of revenue earning
devices (and demo devices) as well as research and development. Depending on use, the Company will transfer the parts to the corresponding
asset or expense if used in research and development.  A charge to income is taken when factors that would result in a need for an
increase in the valuation, such as excess or obsolete inventory, are noted. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 there was a
valuation reserve of $ 155,000
and $ 65,000 , respectively.

Revenue Earning Devices
Revenue earning devices are stated at cost. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 48 months. The Company continually evaluates revenue earning devices
to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life or whether
the devices should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses a combination of the undiscounted cash flows and market approaches
in assessing whether an asset has been impaired. The Company measures impairment losses based upon the amount by which the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds the fair value.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets which range from
two
to
five
years. Major repairs
or improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements and maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend asset lives are expensed
currently.

The Company periodically evaluates the fair value
of fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Upon retirement
or other disposition of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain
or loss, if any, is recognized in income.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed in the
period they are incurred in accordance with ASC 730,
Research and Development
unless they meet specific criteria related to technical,
market and financial feasibility, as determined by Management, including but not limited to the establishment of a clearly defined future
market for the product, and the availability of adequate resources to complete the project. If all criteria are met, the costs are deferred
and amortized over the expected useful life or written off if a product is abandoned. At November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the
Company had no deferred development costs.
Contingencies
Occasionally, the Company may be involved in claims
and legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes
that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If these estimates and assumptions
change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Contingencies
are inherently unpredictable, and the assessments of the value can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Sales of Future Revenues
The Company has entered into transactions, as more
fully described in footnote 8, in which it has received funding from investors in exchange for which it will make payments to those investors
based on the level of sales of certain revenue categories, generally based on a percentage of sales for those certain revenues. The Company
determines whether these agreements constitute sales of future revenues or are in substance debt based on the facts and circumstances
of each agreement, with the following primary criteria determinative of whether the agreement constitutes a sale of future revenues or
debt:
- 10 -
Table of Contents
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
●
Does the agreement purport, in substance, to be a sale
●
Does the Company have continuing involvement in the generation of cash flows due the investor
●
Is the transaction cancellable by either party through payment of a lump sum or other transfer of assets
●
Is the investors rate of return is implicitly limited by the terms of the agreement
●
Does the Company’s revenue for a reporting period underlying the agreement have only a minimal impact on the investor’s rate of return
●
Does the investor have recourse relating to payments due
In the event a transaction is determined to be a sale
of future revenues, it is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized using the sum-of-the-revenue method. In the event a transaction is
determined to be debt, it is recorded as debt and amortized using the effective interest method. As of the date of these financial statements,
the Company has determined that all such agreements are debt.
Revenue Recognition
ASU 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606)” , supersedes the revenue recognition requirements and industry specific guidance under
Revenue Recognition
(Topic 605) . Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step
process that must be evaluated and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition
process than required under existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction
price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The Company adopted Topic 606 on March 1, 2018, using
the modified retrospective method. Under the modified retrospective method, prior period financial positions and results will not be adjusted.
There was no cumulative effect adjustment recognized as a result of this adoption. Refer to Note 4 – Revenue from Contracts with
Customers for additional information. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 , two customers accounted for 41% of total revenue (2021-
60%).
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized when items of income and expense are recognized in the financial
statements in different periods than when recognized in the tax return. Deferred tax assets arise when expenses are recognized in the
financial statements before the tax returns or when income items are recognized in the tax return prior to the financial statements. Deferred
tax assets also arise when operating losses or tax credits are available to offset tax payments due in future years. Deferred tax liabilities
arise when income items are recognized in the financial statements before the tax returns or when expenses are recognized in the tax return
prior to the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax
Act”) was signed into law. ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes requires companies to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation
is enacted. The Company’s gross deferred tax assets were revalued based on the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from
35% to 21%. A corresponding offset has been made to the valuation allowance, and any potential other taxes arising due to the Tax Act
will result in reductions to the Company’s net operating loss carryforward and valuation allowance. The Company will continue to
analyze the Tax Act to assess its full effects on the Company’s financial results, including disclosures, for the Company’s
fiscal year ending February 28, 2023, but the Company does not expect the Tax Act to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements
Leases
Lease agreements are evaluated to determine if they
are sales/finance leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) transfer of ownership of the underlying asset; (b) purchase
option that is reasonably certain of being exercised; (c) the lease term is greater than a major part of the remaining estimated economic
life of the underlying asset; or (d) if the present value of the sum of lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee
that has not already been included in lease payments in accordance with ASC 842-10-30-5(f) equals or exceeds substantially all of the
fair value of the underlying asset.
- 11 -
Table of Contents
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
If at its inception, a lease meets any of the four
lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the Company as a sales/finance; and if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is
classified by the Company as an operating lease.
Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereby an equal amount of rent expense is attributed to each period
during the term of the lease, regardless of when actual payments are made. This generally results in rent expense in excess of cash payments
during the early years of a lease and rent expense less than cash payments in the later years. The difference between rent expense recognized
and actual rental payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in liabilities.
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
The Company relies on the guidance provided by ASC
Topic 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , to classify certain redeemable and/or convertible instruments. The Company
first determines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company will determine the liability classification
if the financial instrument is mandatorily redeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional
obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares.
Once the Company determines that a financial instrument
should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability
section and the equity section of the balance sheet (“temporary equity”). The Company will determine temporary equity classification
if the redemption of the financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e. at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the
Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent equity.
Our Chief Executive Officer/ Chairman holds sufficient
shares of the Company’s voting preferred stock that give sufficient voting rights under the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company such that the CEO/ Chairman can at any time unilaterally vote to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
of the Company, without the need to call a general meeting of common shareholders of the Company.
Initial Measurement
The Company records its financial instruments classified
as liability, temporary equity or permanent equity at issuance at the fair value, or cash received.
Subsequent Measurement – Financial Instruments
Classified as Liabilities
The Company records the fair value of its financial
instruments classified as liabilities at each subsequent measurement date. The changes in fair value of its financial instruments classified
as liabilities are recorded as other income (expenses).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures  (“ASC Topic 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on
market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels,
which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:
- 12 -
Table of Contents
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
●
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
●
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
●
Level 3 – Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”)
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
for the period is used to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and/or warrants. Diluted
EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Basic loss per common share is computed based on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed in a manner similar to the basic loss
per share, except the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include all common shares, including those with the
potential to be issued by virtue of convertible debt and other such convertible instruments. Diluted loss per share contemplates a complete
conversion to common shares of all convertible instruments only if they are dilutive in nature with regards to earnings per share.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards
In
December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance on the accounting and reporting of income taxes.
The guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing exceptions related to certain intraperiod tax allocations
and deferred tax liabilities; clarifying guidance primarily related to evaluating the step-up tax basis for goodwill in a business combination;
and reflecting enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate. The Company adopted the new guidance effective February
1, 2021. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In January 2020,
the FASB issued new guidance intended to clarify certain interactions between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity
method investments and certain derivatives. The guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method of
accounting and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The Company adopted the new guidance
effective February 1, 2021. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In August 2020,
the FASB issued amended guidance on the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance
removes the separation model for convertible debt instruments and preferred stock, amends requirements for conversion options to be classified
in equity as well as amends diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for certain convertible debt instruments. The amended guidance
is effective for interim and annual periods in 2022. The application of the amendments in the new guidance are to be applied either on
a modified retrospective or a retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the effect that the adoption of this standard will have
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020,
the FASB issued optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform
on financial reporting and subsequently issued clarifying amendments. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting
for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference
rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The optional guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied
on a prospective basis at any time between January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021,
the FASB issued amended guidance that requires acquiring entities to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a business
combination in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
in 2023 and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted on a retrospective basis to the beginning of the fiscal year of
adoption. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior
acquisitions; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent upon the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future
business combinations.
In November 2021, the FASB
issued new guidance to increase the transparency of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution
accounting model by analogy. The guidance requires annual disclosures of such transactions to include the nature of the transactions and
the significant terms and conditions, the accounting treatment and the impact to the company’s financial statements. The guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning in 2022 and is to be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
Revenue is earned primarily from two sources: 1) direct
sales of goods or services and 2) short-term rentals. Direct sales of goods or services are accounted for under Topic 606, and short-term
rentals are accounted for under Topic 842 (which addresses lease accounting and was adopted on March 1, 2019).

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
As disclosed in the revenue recognition section of
Note 3 – Accounting Polices, the Company adopted Topic 606 in accordance with the effective date on March 1, 2018. Note 3 includes
disclosures regarding the Company’s method of adoption and the impact on the Company’s financial statements. Revenue is recognized
on direct sales of goods or services when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
After adopting Topic 842, also referred to above in
Note 3, the Company is accounting for revenue earned from rental activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and
the customer has the ability to control that asset. The Company recognizes revenue from its device rental activities when persuasive evidence
of a contract exists, the performance obligations have been satisfied, the transaction price is fixed or determinable and collection is
reasonably assured. Performance obligations associated with device rental transactions are satisfied over the rental period. Rental periods
are short-term in nature. Therefore, the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient which eliminates the requirement to disclose
information about remaining performance obligations. Payments are due from customers at the completion of the rental, except for customers
with negotiated payment terms, generally net 30 days or less, which are invoiced and remain as accounts receivable until collected.
The following table presents revenues from contracts
with customers disaggregated by product/service:

LEASES
We lease certain warehouses, and office space. Leases
with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we did not combine lease and
non-lease components.
There is no lease renewal. The depreciable life of
assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably
certain of exercise.
Below is a summary of our lease assets and liabilities
at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022.

Note: As most of our leases do not provide an implicit

date in determining the present value of lease payments. We compare against loans we obtain to acquire physical assets and not loans we
obtain for financing. The loans we obtain for financing are generally at significantly higher rates and we believe that physical space
or vehicle rental agreements are in line with physical asset financing agreements. CAM charges were not included in operating lease expense
and were expensed in general and administrative expenses as incurred.
Rent expense and operating lease cost was $ 61,005

DEFERRED VARIABLE PAYMENT OBLIGATION
On February 1, 2019 the Company entered into an agreement
with an investor whereby the investor would pay up to $ 900,000
in exchange for a perpetual
9 % rate payment (Payments) on the Company’s
reported quarterly revenue from operations excluding any gains or losses from financial instruments (Revenues). At
February 29, 2020
the
investor has advanced the full $900,000.
On May 9, 2019 the Company entered into two similar
arrangements with two investors:
- 16 -
Table of Contents
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(1)
The investor would pay up to $ 400,000
in exchange for a perpetual
4 % rate Payment on the Company’s reported quarterly Revenues. At February 29, 2020, $ 400,000
has been paid to the Company.
(2)
The investor would pay up to $ 50,000
in exchange for a perpetual
1.11 % rate Payment on the Company’s reported quarterly Revenues. At February 29, 2020, $ 50,000
has been paid to the Company.
These variable payments (Payments) are to be made
30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. If the Payments would deplete RAD’s available cash by more than 30%, the Payments
may be deferred for up to 12 months after the quarterly report at an interest rate of 6% per annum on the unpaid amount.
In the event that at least 10% of the assets of the
Company are sold by the Company, the investors would be entitled to the fair market value (FMV) of all future Payments associated with
the assets sold as determined by an independent valuator to be chosen by the investors. The FMV cannot exceed 30% of the total asset disposition
price defined as the total price paid for the assets plus all future Payments associated with the assets sold. In the event that the common
or preferred shares are sold by the Company to a third party as to effect a change in control, then the investors must be paid the FMV
of all future Payments in one lump payment.
The FMV cannot exceed 30% of the share disposition price defined as the total price the third
party paid for the shares plus the total value of all future Payments .
On November 18, 2019, the Company entered into another
similar arrangement with the (February 1, 2019) investor above whereby the investor would advance up to $ 225,000
in exchange for a perpetual
2.25 % rate Payment on the Company’s quarterly Revenues (commencing on quarter ending May 31, 2020). At February 29, 2020, the investor
has advanced $ 109,000
and the investor advanced the $ 116,000
remainder as of May 2020.
On December 30, 2019, the Company entered into another
similar arrangement with a new investor whereby the investor would advance up to $ 100,000
in exchange for a perpetual
1.00 % rate Payment
on the Company’s quarterly Revenues (commencing quarter ended November 30, 2020). At February 29, 2020, the investor has advanced
$50,000 with the remainder to be advanced no later than June 30, 2020. If the total investor advances turns out to be less than $100,000,
this would not constitute a breach of the agreement, rather the 1.00% rate would be adjusted on a pro-rata basis.
On April 22, 2020, the Company entered into another
similar arrangement with the (first May 9, 2019) investor above whereby the investor would advance up to $ 100,000  in exchange for
a perpetual
1.00 % rate Payment on the Company’s quarterly Revenues. At May 31, 2020, the investor has fully funded this commitment.
On July 1, 2020, the Company entered into a similar
agreement with the first investor whereby the investor would pay up to $ 800,000
in exchange for a perpetual
2.75 % rate payment (Payment)
on the Company’s reported quarterly revenue. These Payments are to be made 90 days after the fiscal quarter with the first payment
being due no later than May 31, 2021.
If the Payments would deplete RAD’s available cash by more than 20%, the payment may be deferred.
The investor had agreed to pay $100,000 per month over an 8 month period with the first payment due July 2020 and the final payment no
later than February 28, 2021. As at November 30, 2020 the investor had fully funded the $800,000 commitment
On August 27, 2020, the Company and the first investor
referred to above consolidated the three separate agreements of February 1, 2019 for $900,000, November 18, 2019 for $225,000 and July
1, 2020 for $800,000 into a new agreement for a total of $ 1,925,000 . This new agreement is for similar terms as the above agreements
save for the following: the rate payment is revised to
14.25 % payable on revenues commencing the quarter ended November 30, 2020. Upon
an event of default that we are unable to cure in the time allotted under the agreements, these Payments may be secured with a priority
lien by UCC filing against all of our assets, but is subordinated to equipment financing or leasing agreements on the products the Company
leases to its customers.
In summary of all agreements mentioned above if in
the event that at least
10 % of the assets of the Company are sold by the Company, the investors would be entitled to the fair market value
(FMV) of all future Payments associated with the assets sold as determined by an independent valuator to be chosen by the investors. The
FMV cannot exceed 43.77% of the total asset disposition price defined as the total price paid for the assets plus all future Payments
associated with the assets sold. In the event that the common or preferred shares are sold by the Company to a third party as to effect
a change in control, then the investors must be paid the FMV of all future Payments in one lump payment.
The FMV cannot exceed 43.77%
of the share disposition price defined as the total price the third party paid for the shares plus the total value of all future Payments.
As of March 1, 2021 as a result of the amendment with the first investor noted below. This aggregate asset disposition % was reduced from
43.77 % to 33.77%

The Payments will first become payable on June 30,
2019 (unless otherwise indicated) based on the quarterly Revenues for the quarter ended May 31, 2019 and will accrue every quarter thereafter.
As of February 28, 2022, the Company has accrued approximately $325,600 in Payments (February 28, 2021 -$91,587).
On March 1, 2021, the first investor referred to above whose aggregate
investment is $ 1,925,000
revised his agreements as follows:
1)
The rate payment was reduced from
14.25
% to
9.65
%
2)
The asset disposition % (see below) was reduced from
31
% to
21 %
In consideration for the above changes, the investor
received 40 Series F Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase
367
shares of its Series F Convertible Preferred Stock with
a five-year term and an exercise price of $ 1.00 . During the three months ended May 31, 2021, the warrant holder exercised warrants to
acquire
38
shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company attributed a fair value based on recent transactions for the Series
F Preferred stock and warrants of $ 33,015,214
and recorded a loss on settlement of debt with a corresponding adjustment to paid in capital.
The Company retains total involvement in the generation
of cash flows from these revenue streams that form the basis of the payments to be made to the investors under this agreement. Because
of this, the Company has determined that the agreements constitute debt agreements. As of November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022, the
long-term balances other than Payments already owed is the cash received of $ 2,525,000
a nd $ 2,525,000 , respectively.

30, 2022 and year ended February 28, 2022, the Company has received $0 related to the deferred payment obligation since there were no
new agreements during this period. The balance remains $ 2,525,000
at both November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022.
The Payments first become payable on June 30, 2019
(unless otherwise indicated) based on the quarterly Revenues for the quarter ended May 31, 2019 and accrue every quarter thereafter. As
of November 30, 2022, the Company has accrued $ 497,150
in Payments (February 28, 2022 -$ 325,600 ). At November 30, 2022, and February 28,

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
Occasionally, the Company may be involved in claims
and legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes
that is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If these estimates and assumptions
change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Contingencies
are inherently unpredictable, and the assessments of the value can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions.
The related legal costs are expensed as incurred.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021 should be read in conjunction with
our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion
includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022, as filed on May 27, 2022 with the SEC. We use words such as “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,”
“believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
Unless expressly indicated or the context requires
otherwise, the terms “AITX”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to
Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc.
Overview
Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc.
(“we”, “our, “us”, “AITX” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida on March
25, 2010 as On the Move Systems Inc. and was quoted on OTC Pinks as ‘OMVS’. We reincorporated in Nevada on February 17, 2015.
Our fiscal year end is February 28 (February 29 during leap year). We are located at 10800 Galaxie Ave., Ferndale, Michigan 48220, and
our telephone number is 877-767-6268. We completed a stock ticker change to AITX in 2018. Steve Reinharz became our Chief Executive Officer
in March 2021 and is the founder of our primary wholly owned subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD). We have a 3-year executive
compensation agreement with our CEO.
Our mission is to apply artificial intelligence (AI)
technology to solve enterprise security-related problems categorized as expensive, repetitive, difficult to staff, dangerous, and outside
of the core competencies of the client organization.
For example:
●
Typical security guard-related functions such as monitoring a parking lot during and after hours and responding appropriately. This scenario applies to perimeters, interior yard areas, and related similar environments.
●
Integrated hardware/software with AI-driven responses simulating and expanding on what legacy or manned solutions could perform.
●
Performance of difficult, rare, and high value tasks such as firearm detection and immediate response whether autonomously or with human assistance.
●
Automation of common access control functions through technology utilizing facial recognition and machine vision, leapfrogging over most legacy solutions in use today.
●
Patrol and response of commercial, industrial and government areas requiring heightened security work to be completed via autonomous mobile robotics devices.
RAD solutions are unique due to their functionalities,
as follows:
●
Start with an AI-driven autonomous response utilizing cellular-optimized communications, while easily connecting to a human operator for a manned response, as needed.
●
Use RAD’s exclusive hardware and software, purpose-built by for delivery of these solutions. Various form factors have been customized to deliver this new functionality, both mobile and stationary.
●
Deliver services through -RAD developed software and cloud services, allowing enterprise IT groups to focus on core competencies instead of maintenance of complex video and security platforms.
●
Perform workflow functions via purpose-built fixed and mobile devices with unique technology and methodology.

Through our subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices,
Inc. (RAD), AITX is redefining the $25 billion (US) security and guarding services industry through its broad lineup of innovative, AI-driven
Solutions-as-a-Service business model. RAD solutions are specifically designed to provide a cost savings to businesses of between 35%
and 80% when compared to the industry’s existing and costly manned security guarding and monitoring model. RAD delivers this costs
savings via a suite of stationary and mobile robotic security solutions that complement, and at times, directly replace the need for human
personnel in environments better suited for machines.
At the beginning of the prior fiscal year ended February
28, 2022, AITX began its 10-year lease at its 29,316 sq ft manufacturing facility outside of Detroit, Michigan, hired the employees, and
acquired the infra-structure to support it. This facility, referred to by RAD as ‘the REX’ positions AITX to achieve its growth
objectives and meet future sales demands.
As of January 16, 2023, there were approximately 300
RAD units deployed with approximately 290 units on backorder, in production or en route to deployment. Additionally, RAD has reported
a total authorized dealer count of 55. RAD distributes its products through a combination of direct sales to end-users and opportunities
developed through its dealer channel.
Our 85 employees as of January 16, 2023 constitute
our workforce that supports the necessary infrastructure (Engineering, Production, Business Development, Marketing, Administration) built
to achieve our growth objectives and meet future sales demands. We strive for rapid growth and creation/expansion of our departments and
teams; however, this creates significant challenges that if unsuccessful will negatively impact our results of operations.
We and our subsidiaries have launched several new
solutions during the 3 rd
quarter of the current fiscal year (FY2023), including:
●
RIO™, a portable, solar-powered, wide-area security device. RIO was formally introduced to the security industry at one of its premier trade shows, GSX 2022 in Atlanta in September 2022.
●
ROSA-P, a switched-powered security and safety solution that powers RAD’s best-selling ROSA 3.x where power does not currently exist in the industry at night.
●
RADDOG™, the security industry’s purpose-built mobile robot dog.
●
ROSS™, a software solution which enables millions of IP security cameras presently deployed with the ability to connect with the RAD ecosystem (RADSoC). ROSS empowers these non-RAD cameras to run the same AI analytic capabilities as other RAD hardware solutions.
●
Wholly owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Group, Inc. (RAD-G) announced the launch of a sales initiative targeting OEM markets. This market development endeavor marks our first of its kind  and involves the placement of hardware and software solutions developed across all subsidiaries for use in other vertical markets through OEM suppliers.
●
Wholly owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc., is expected to make a new solution announcement sometime in FY2024.
These solutions utilize the comprehensive RAD platform
to offer unparalleled, all-in-one, security and safety solutions that can be implemented within a half hour. These solutions include cutting-edge
features such as the detection of firearms, deterrents for trespassing, peripheral surveillance, management of visitors, and more.
RAD’s sales funnel has experienced substantial
growth in both volume and value.
RAD is working towards adding the following deployments
to be in place by February 29, 2024:
●
25 ROAMEOs, the robust mobile-patrolling security robot. The current schedule, subject to engineering development timelines, parts availability and manufacturing, has these ROAMEO units available to ship to clients and start billing as soon as August 2023. We  expect to deploy 5-10 a month beginning in August. Pre-selling has begun with the goal of exceeding 25 units for FY2024.
●
150 RIOs, portable solar-powered, wide-area security devices. RAD’s largest dealer is expected to add this to their line card by May 2023 which we can reasonably expect will drive significant volume. Management expects RIO revenue to begin significance towards the end of Q2 FY2024.

Table of Contents
●
350 ROSAs / ROSA-Ps, stationary security and safety solutions. This number of ROSA & ROSA P units is roughly at the same run rate as the last few months of calendar year 2022 and is considered by management to be easily achievable. Management expects a minimum of 30 units being added monthly to recurring monthly revenue beginning March 1, 2023.
●
100 AVAs, an autonomous access control / vehicle access device. AVA 3.0 units hit 10 deployed units by mid-January. Early indications of market reception are positive and it’s expected that dealers will begin ordering in greater quantities as management gathers more case studies and references.
●
15 RADDOG™, the security industry’s purpose-built robot dog. RADDOG version 1.0 was first publicly displayed on December 7, 2022 at the Company’s Investor Open House and Technology Reveal. As was stated at that time all of our  tests were successful and we are  moving forward with a larger, stronger version to commercialize. This version will be shown at the ISC West trade show in Las Vegas at the end of March and will be available to ship to clients in the May time frame. The projected number of 15 is considered conservative by management for FY2024.
●
5000 IP camera integrations via ROSS. These are expected to be ‘take-over’ or ‘side-by-side’ type deployments featuring pre-existing LAN connected IP security cameras. ‘Take-over’ deployments would replace the pre-existing Video Management System and ‘side-by-side’ deployments would leave the existing systems in place and use secondary camera feeds through ROSS.
●
35 TOM autonomous visitor management devices. TOM, an acronym for ‘The Office Manager’ is the evolution and replacement for Wally™. ‘TOM+’ is scheduled for development and release in FY2024. Currently RAD’s largest single client has deployed TOM units throughout the US and at two European locations. Given monthly sales orders it is expected that this 35 unit target could be met entirely by this one client. We are  discussing rolling the product out to its dealer channel as at the moment it is only available to this single client.
The realization of the deployments, if successful
and if within a 10% range of standard RAD dealer pricing, will result in our recurring monthly revenues reaching approximately $800,000,
and if achieved, would enable us to attain positive cash flow. As such, we will continue to focus on improving existing team members’
efficiency and productivity with a focus on retention. Achievement of the sales goals listed herein will require approximately 5% to 10%
headcount growth in the production and deployment teams which could push back the goals of positive cash flow.
Several significant new clients are expected to receive
their deployments in FY2024 and are expected to be public. Security is generally a private corporate function and we note that prior clients
that have been publicized have been inundated with shareholder phone calls looking for further verification. It is for these reasons that
we will continue to rarely pursue publicization of end users.
FY2024 will feature balancing efforts on cost savings
with accelerated growth in order to increase probability of achieving targeted positive cash flow targets.

Our operating expenses were comprised of general and
administrative expenses, research and development, and depreciation. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional
services, automobile expenses, advertising, salaries and wages, travel expenses and consultants. Our operating expenses during the three-month
period ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, were $3,090,941 and $5,118,000, respectively. The overall decrease of $2,027,059 was
primarily attributable to the following changes in operating expenses of:
●
General and administrative expenses decreased by $1,840,744. In comparing the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021 this decrease was primarily due to the following decreases: stock based compensation of $819,500 for higher prior year charges based on the CEO incentive plan, wages and salaries for prior year bonuses paid, bad debts expense of $25,785 and professional fees of $126,435. These decreases were offset by the following increases: insurance of $51,485 due to health plan for new employees and increased liability and property insurance due to new manufacturing facility,  advertising , sales and marketing of $82,893, subcontractor fees of $13,802, travel of $18,004, duty and freight of $36,230  and bad debts expense due to a general provision of $40,000 on slow payers due to present economic factors.
●
Research and development decreased by $169,133 due to higher activity in the prior year in R&D design and equipment for the development of new products such as ROAMEO and AVA, as well as upgrades of existing products. That decrease was partially offset by an increase in research and development paid to a related party of $146,995.
●
Depreciation and amortization increased by $24,928 due to the acquisition of computer equipment and new revenue earning devices.
●
Operating lease cost and rent decreased by $42,110 due to one less office lease for the three months ended November 30, 2022 comparing to the three months ended November 30, 2021.

Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) consisted of the change
of fair value of derivative instruments, loss on settlement of debt and interest. Other income (expense) during the three months
ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, was ($1,271,158) and ($2,206,915), respectively. The $935,757 decrease in other
expense, net was primarily attributable to reduced interest expense.
●
Interest expense decreased by $779,096 due to a decrease in debt amortization expense. The three months ended November 30, 2021 had higher amortization due to debt settlements.
●
Loss on settlement of debt was $0 the quarter ended November 30, 2022 and $156,661 in the quarter ended November 30, 2022.
Net loss
We had a net loss of $4,085,660 for the three months
ended November 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $7,094,442 for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in net loss of
$3,008,782 is due to a number of factors: higher gross profit and lower general and administrative and other expense in the three months
ended November 30, 2022.

Total revenue for the nine-month period ended November
30, 2022 was $1,055,040 which represented a decrease of $20,763 compared to total revenue of $1,075,803 for the nine months ended November
30, 2021. The small decrease was a result of unusually large unit sales which includes sales of new units totaling $692,369 which occurred
in the nine months ended November 30, 2021. This was partially offset by a 62% increase in rental activities increased as the Company
continues to grow its rental business.
Gross profit
Total gross profit for the nine-month period ended
November 30, 2022 was $601,142 which represented a decrease of $178,357, compared to gross profit of $779,449 for the nine months ended
November 30, 2021. The decrease resulted both from lower revenues noted above as well as cost of sales increases in 2022 due to inventory
changes. The gross profit percentage of 57% for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2022 was lower than the margin of 72% for the
prior year’s corresponding period was primarily due to inventory adjustments due to shrinkage and obsolescence totaling $123,309,
which occurred in the first quarter. Before these adjustments the gross profit % for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 would have
been a comparable 69%.

Our operating expenses were comprised of general and
administrative expenses, research and development, and depreciation. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional
services, automobile expenses, advertising, salaries and wages, travel expenses and consultants. Our operating expenses during the nine-month
period ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, were $10,090,732 and $11,102,944, respectively. The overall decrease of $1,012,212
was primarily attributable to the following changes in operating expenses of:
●
General and administrative expenses decreased by $1,692,622. In comparing the
nine-months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021 may be partially explained by the following decreases: wages and salaries
by $144,439, professional fees by $535,117, subcontractor fees $89,492 and stock-based compensation $1,677,050. These were
partially offset by increases in the following accounts: sales and marketing by $314,098, travel by $115,122, insurance by $229,562,
duty and freight by $66,067,bad debts expense $117,193, and office expense by $73,922.
●
Research and development increased by $484,451 due to funding development of new products as well as
upgrades of existing products that mostly took place in the first two quarters of 2022. Included in that increase is the
increase in research and development paid to a related party of $1,064,636. This increase was partially offset by the higher
development costs incurred in equipment and design on new products for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2021.
●
Depreciation and amortization increased by $179,382 due to the acquisition of ERP computer software, computer equipment tooling, and 54 new revenue earning devices.
●
Operating lease cost and rent decreased by $12,548 due to the expiration of one lease in early fiscal 2022.
●
(Gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets increase by $29,125 due to a vehicle sold in the prior year.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) during the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, was ($ 3,440,621 ) and ($37,508,288), respectively. The $34,067,677
increase in other income was primarily attributable to the change in the fair value of derivatives, interest expense, and loss on settlement
of debt.
●
In comparing the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and the nine months ended November
30, 2021, the change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $368,907 due to the re-valuation of derivative liability
on convertible notes based on the change in the market price of the Company’s common stock as well as reductions in derivative
liability as a result of settlements on the underlying debt.
●
Interest expense decreased by $1,364,269 due to the decrease in debt amortization expense. The three
months ended November 30, 2021 had higher amortization due to debt settlements.
●
Gain (loss) on settlement of debt was $3,992 the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and
($33,068,313) in the nine months ended November 30, 2021. This current period the gain was a result of the reduction of the
derivative liability , the prior year’s period has an amendment of the deferred variable payment obligation
that led to a $33,015,215 loss which was partially offset by gains from accrued liabilities settlements and the debt
exchange for common shares. This loss on settlement of debt was non-cash and has no effect on the cash flows of the Company.

Net loss
We had a net loss of $12,930,211 for the nine months
ended November 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $47,831,733 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The change is primarily the
result of the loss on settlement in the nine months ended November 30, 2021 as well as the lower general and administrative expenses and
other items discussed above.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows
Management believes that we will continue to incur
losses for the immediate future. Therefore, we will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive
cash flows from operating activities, if ever. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include and adjustments relating to the recovery of assets or the classification
of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
As of November 30, 2022, we had a cash balance of
$713,493, net accounts receivable of $464,044, net device parts inventory of $1,573,380 and $4,470,418 in current liabilities. At the
current cash consumption rate, we will need to consider additional funding sources going forward. We are taking proactive measures to
reduce operating expenses and drive growth in revenue.
The successful outcome of future activities cannot
be determined at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business
plan or generate positive operating results.

Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of November 30, 2022. Based upon
that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of November 30, 2022, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by us under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
1.
As of November 30, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over our control environment. Specifically, we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further, the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.
2.
As of November 30, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
- 37 -
Table of Contents
Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Change in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
The only change in internal controls was the implementation
of the Company’s new CRM/ERP/Accounting software. This change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during
the period covered by this report, should not have materially affected, or is not reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.
