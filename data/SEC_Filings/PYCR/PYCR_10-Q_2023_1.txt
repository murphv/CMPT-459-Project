Exhibits 46            Signatures 47 2 Table of Contents Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors,” contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, our objectives for future operations, and any statements of a general economic or industry specific nature, are forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely,” “outlook,” “potential,” “targets,” “contemplates,” or the negative or plural of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe, based on information currently available to our management, may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, related to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy, and liquidity. Accordingly, there are, or will be, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to: • Our ability to manage our growth effectively. • The resulting effects of any potential breach of our security measures or any unauthorized access to our customers’ or their employees’ personal data, including by way of computer viruses, worms, phishing and ransomware attacks, malicious software programs, and other data security threats. • The expansion and retention of our direct sales force with qualified and productive persons and the related effects on the growth of our business. • The impact on customer expansion and retention if implementation, user experience, customer service, or performance relating to our solutions is not satisfactory. • The timing of payments made to employees and taxing authorities relative to the timing of when a customer’s electronic funds transfers are settled to our account. • Future acquisitions of other companies’ businesses, technologies, or customer portfolios. • The continued service of our key executives. • Our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, technologically advanced products and services. • Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including software developers and skilled IT, sales, marketing, and operation personnel. • The proper operation of our software. • Our relationships with third parties. • Damage, failure, or disruption of our Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) delivery model, data centers, or our third-party providers’ services. • Our ability to protect our intellectual and proprietary rights. • The use of open source software in our applications. • The growth of the market for cloud-based human capital management and payroll software among small and medium- sized businesses (“SMBs”). • The competitiveness of our market generally. • The ongoing effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other adverse macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which we and our customers operate. • The impact of an economic downturn or recession in the United States (“U.S.”) or global economy. • Our customers’ dependence on our solutions to comply with applicable laws. • Our ability to comply with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws. 3 Table of Contents • Changes in laws, regulations, or requirements applicable to our software and services. • The impact of privacy, data protection, tax and other laws and regulations. • Our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. • The other risk factors set forth under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on August 24, 2022. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after the date of this report, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as may be required by law. 4 Table of Contents Part I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Basis of presentation and consolidation The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and include all of the information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim reporting. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2022 in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 24, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods do not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements and are not necessarily indicative of results for any future interim periods and the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 11   Use of estimates
The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the recognition of revenue, evaluation of potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition can also be affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions, including but not limited to health epidemics and pandemics and their resulting economic impact. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, and government fiscal policies can have a significant effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. While the Company maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, the Company could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings.
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable balances are shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 5,270
and $ 3,268
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts considers factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balance and current and forecasted economic conditions that may affect a client’s ability to pay. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and generally requires no collateral from clients. Management reviews individual accounts as they become past due to determine collectability. The allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically based on management’s consideration of past due accounts. Individual accounts are charged against the allowance when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with the Company’s direct sales and marketing staff, including employee-related costs, marketing, advertising and promotion expenses, and other related costs. Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense totaled approximately $ 7,483
and $ 4,889
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Advertising and promotion expense totaled approximately $ 13,401
and $ 9,875
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes all employee and director stock-based compensation as a cost in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Equity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award and expense is recognized, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the award. The Company establishes grant date fair value of RSUs based on the fair value of the Company's underlying common stock. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock options, including common stock purchased as a part of the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires management to make assumptions with respect to the fair value of the Company's award on the grant date, including the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the Company's stock calculated based on a period of time generally commensurate with the expected term of the award, the expected risk-free rate of return, and expected dividend yields of the Company's stock.
The Company recognized stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $ 20,684
and $ 17,215 , respectively. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $ 37,635
and $ 39,027 , respectively.
Leases
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASC 842”), as subsequently amended, on July 1, 2022, through the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of that date.
ASC 842 requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and disclose key information about leasing arrangements for certain leases.
Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2022 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting treatment. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of the new
12 standard resulted in recording additional lease assets and liabilities of $ 17,457
and $ 24,626 , respectively, as of July 1, 2022. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.
See Note 10 - “Leases” for additional information. Pending accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” (Topic 326). This update establishes a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amended standard will also update the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, requiring entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on any such securities is a credit loss. The Company is currently evaluating this standard and the potential effects of these changes to its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, but does not expect adoption of this new standard on July 1, 2023 to have a material impact. 3.
REVENUE:
The following table disaggregates revenue from contracts by recurring fees and implementation services and other, which the Company believes depicts the nature, amount and timing of its revenue:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Recurring fees $ 121,873   $ 99,556   $ 232,935   $ 188,765   Implementation services and other 3,109   3,173   6,216   6,380   Recurring and other revenue $ 124,982   $ 102,729   $ 239,151   $ 195,145   Deferred revenue
The Company recognizes deferred revenue for nonrefundable upfront fees as well as for subscription services related to certain ancillary products invoiced prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligation. The nonrefundable upfront fees related to implementation services are typically included on the client’s first invoice. Implementation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over an estimated
24-month
period to which the material right exists, which is the period the client is expected to benefit from not having to pay an additional nonrefundable implementation fee upon renewal of the service.
The following table summarizes the changes in deferred revenue related to the nonrefundable upfront fees and recurring subscription services:

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ASSET ACQUISITION:
Acquisition of Talenya Ltd.
On October 27, 2022 the Company acquired
100 % of the equity interests of Talenya Ltd., an Israeli-based provider of an artificial intelligence-driven solution for talent sourcing and recruiting employees (the “Talenya Acquisition”) for an initial cash purchase price of $ 20,000 , plus up to a maximum of $ 10,000
in additional cash payments based on the achievement of established earnouts over a
two-year
period. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of the total consideration transferred at the date of acquisition.
14 The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill consists primarily of the synergistic benefits and growth opportunities. The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based on strategic benefits that are expected to be realized from the Talenya Acquisition. The benefits include acquiring a software technology tailored to small and medium-sized businesses that can be integrated into the current suite of Company products.
The preliminary purchase price for the Talenya Acquisition has been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: October 27, 2022 Fair value of total consideration $ 27,965   Cash acquired ( 174 ) Net purchase price $ 27,791   Assets acquired: Accounts receivable $ 192   Other current assets 105   Property and equipment 13   Technology intangible assets 7,160   Other intangible assets 50   Other non-current assets 979   Total identifiable assets acquired 8,499   Liabilities assumed: Accounts payable ( 243 ) Accrued expenses ( 917 ) Deferred revenue ( 293 ) Total identifiable liabilities assumed ( 1,453 ) Goodwill 20,745   Fair value of total consideration transferred $ 27,791   The technology intangible assets acquired have a weighted average useful life of
7
years. The fair value of the contingent consideration was measured at the acquisition date based on management’s estimate of future payments and recorded as a liability on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $ 1,174
related to the Talenya Acquisition for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. These costs were expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses within the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Asset Acquisition
On February 4, 2021, the Company acquired payroll, timekeeping and HCM service customer relationships from another large provider of HCM services for an initial purchase price of approximately $ 9,300 , which included approximately $ 50
of transaction costs. As part of this asset purchase, the Company was required to make quarterly contingent payments and a final payment to the seller based on the revenue generated by the acquired clients over a
12 -month period. Contingent payments made for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ —
and $ 2,242 , respectively. Contingent payments made for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 4,259
and $ 2,437 , respectively. As of September 30, 2022, all contingent payments have been made.
The acquired customer relationships are recorded as an intangible asset within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
three years . As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining amortization period for these intangible assets was approximately
1.1
years. The contingent payments were recognized when each contingency was resolved and the consideration was paid or became payable as an increase to the acquired intangible asset, amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the initial acquired intangible asset.

Proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities for the three months December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $ 70,910
and $ 34,977 , respectively. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $ 214,017
and $ 74,909 , respectively. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
The Company reviews its investments on an ongoing basis to determine if any are other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. The Company has no material individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position greater than twelve months. The Company believes these unrealized losses, to the extent they exist, generally result from changes in interest rates rather than credit risk, and therefore does not believe the related investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. Additionally, the Company believes it will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at December 31, 2022. Expected maturities as of December 31, 2022 for client fund assets are as follows:
Due within fiscal year 2023 $ 972,519   Due within fiscal year 2024 111,055   Due within fiscal year 2025 54,355   Due within fiscal year 2026 44,127   Due within fiscal year 2027 1,418   Total $ 1,183,474     16 6.

Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 750,155   Talenya Acquisition 20,745   Foreign currency translation ( 780 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 770,120   On August 7, 2022, the Company entered into a
16-year
partnership with the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League that grants the Company the exclusive naming rights to Paycor Stadium, home to the Cincinnati Bengals since 2000.
Contractual payments under the naming rights agreement began in August 2022 and end in 2038.
The naming rights have been recorded as an intangible asset within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet in an amount equal to the present value of the future contractual cash flows with an offsetting liability for payments to be made in the future. The intangible asset reflects the naming rights to the Bengals stadium including co-branding and shared promotion, along with the right for the Company to place its logo on and around the stadium.
The discount between the offsetting liability and overall payment obligation is amortized to interest expense over the term of the agreement using the effective interest method. The intangible asset is being amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis through sales and marketing expense. The liability is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

DEBT AGREEMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT: Credit Agreement Paycor, Inc. is party to a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), Fifth Third, National Association, and other lenders, providing a
$ 200,000
senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility includes an “accordion feature” that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional principal amount of up to $ 200,000 , with a resulting maximum principal amount of $ 400,000 , subject to the participating lenders electing to increase their commitments or new lenders being added to the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on June 11, 2026. The Company had
no
outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company had
no
outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. 10.
LEASES: The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities associated with leases based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the later of the commencement date of the lease or July 1, 2022. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the recognition date in determining the present value of future payments for leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit rate. Lease terms reflect options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. ROU assets and obligations for short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has agreements that contain lease and non-lease components. Generally, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components in the contract as a single lease component.
The Company has various lease agreements for office space and other leases which are classified as operating leases and for equipment which is classified as finance leases.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are factored into the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Lease costs for operating leases, including short-term leases, are recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The table below presents the Company’s leased assets and related lease liabilities: 19 Leases Classification December 31, 2022 Assets Operating leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 22,553   Finance lease assets Property and equipment, net 660   Liabilities Current: Operating Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 5,789   Finance Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 291   Non-current: Operating Long-term operating leases 22,310   Finance Other long-term liabilities 482

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: U.S. GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Valuation techniques that are consistent with the market, income or cost approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the Company can access. Level 2 inputs are inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and rely on management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value of certain assets, such as nonfinancial assets, primarily long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets and certain other assets, are recognized or disclosed in connection with impairment evaluations. All non-recurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The following table presents information on the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:

REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS: In July 2021, the Company fully redeemed its outstanding Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock using a portion of the IPO proceeds. The redemption price per share was equal to
101 % of the liquidation preference, plus the amount of all accrued dividends for the then current and all prior dividend payment periods, or $ 260,044 .
As of
December 31, 2022 , there are no holders of the Company’s Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock
and all of the Company’s subsidiaries are wholly-owned . Measurement Accretion of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes $ —

CAPITAL STOCK:
The Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorized the issuance of up to
500,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.001

50,000,000
shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001

175,856,650
and
174,909,539
shares of common stock outstanding, respectively, and
no
preferred stock outstanding. On September 9, 2022, investment funds advised by Apax Partners completed an underwritten public offering of
5,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at a price to the public of $ 27.35
per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this sale. 22 On December 6, 2022, investment funds advised by Apax Partners completed an underwritten public offering of

NET LOSS PER SHARE: Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to
Paycor HCM , Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to
Paycor HCM , Inc., adjusted as necessary for the impact of potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period and the impact of securities that would have a dilutive effect. Potentially dilutive securities during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included RSUs, stock options, Series A Preferred Stock and ESPP purchase rights. Due to the net loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, any potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the denominator in calculating diluted net loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect. Additionally, the Company also excluded stock-based compensation awards representing membership interest units in Pride Aggregator, L.P. for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. The resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. 23 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our unaudited condensed consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report as well as management’s discussion and analysis and audited consolidated financial statements included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis reflects our historical results of operations and financial position. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements because of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this report, particularly “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and other important factors disclosed previously under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” and similar references refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview
We are a leading provider of human capital management (“HCM”) software. Our solutions target small and medium-sized businesses with 10-1,000 employees. Our unified, cloud-native platform is designed to empower leaders to build winning teams by modernizing people management. Paycor’s modern Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) HCM solution automates routine management tasks so frontline leaders can focus on the key elements that drive business performance and employee engagement, such as goal setting, coaching and talent development. Our comprehensive suite of solutions enables organizations to streamline administrative workflows and achieve regulatory compliance while serving as the single, secure system of record for employee data. Our modern, extensible platform is augmented by industry-specific domain expertise and offers award-winning ease-of-use with an intuitive user experience and deep third-party integrations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30,000 customers across all 50 states trust us to empower their leaders to build winning teams. Our Business Model Our revenue is almost entirely recurring in nature and largely attributable to the sale of SaaS subscriptions to our cloud-native HCM software platform. We typically generate revenue from customers on a per-employee-per-month (“PEPM”) basis whereby our revenue is derived from the number of employees of a given customer, and the amount, type, and timing of products provided to a customer’s employees. As a result, we increase our recurring revenue as we add more customers, and as our customers add more employees and purchase additional product modules. Our highly recurring revenue model provides significant visibility into our future operating results. Recurring and other revenues are primarily revenues derived from the provision of our four HCM software bundles and nonrefundable implementation fees, which represented approximately 94% and 95% of total revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. In addition, we earn interest income on funds held for clients. Our go-to-market strategy consists of a robust organic sales and marketing engine and broad referral network of health insurance and retirement benefits brokers. We market and sell our solutions through a direct sales force, which is organized into field and inside sales teams based on customer size and geography. Our highly efficient and multi-pronged go-to-market strategy is a key driver of our growth. The table below sets forth selected results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 24 Three Months Ended

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a definition of our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Impact of Adverse Macroeconomic Conditions Certain macroeconomic conditions initially impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19 pandemic”), such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, have contributed to inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, all of which are expected to continue to impact our and our customers’ businesses for the foreseeable future. Further, it is possible that fiscal or monetary policies adopted in an attempt to curtail the broadening or protracted extension of these negative conditions could lead to an economic slowdown or cause a recession in the United States or global economy. Our business and financial performance may be unfavorably impacted in future periods if a significant number of our customers are unable to continue as viable businesses or if they significantly reduce headcount, there is a reduction in business confidence and activity, a decrease in government and consumer spending, a decrease in HCM and payroll solutions spending by SMBs, or a decrease in growth in the overall market, among other factors. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to:
Expand Our Sales Footprint to Add New Customers
Our current customer base represents a small portion of the U.S. market for HCM and payroll solutions. We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to broaden our customer base, particularly in the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States (i.e. Tier 1 markets), by expanding our sales headcount. Our ability to do so will depend on several factors, including the ability to recruit sales staff, the effectiveness of our products, the relative pricing of our products, our competitors’ offerings, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 30,000 and 29,000 customers, respectively, representing a period-over-period increase of 3.4%. We define a customer as a parent company grouping, which may include multiple subsidiary client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers. We also track client accounts as it provides an alternative measure of the scale of our business and customers. In addition, we are focused on expanding broker relationships to drive the acquisition of new customers through mutual referrals. Insurance and benefits brokers are trusted advisors to SMBs and are influential in the HCM selection process.
Increase Product Penetration with Existing and New Customers
In recent years we have increasingly focused our product pricing strategy away from sales of individual products and solutions towards a simplified bundled pricing approach whereby we market multi-product offerings to our customers. We believe that this strategy addresses a key need for SMB customers, while also allowing us to better serve the needs of leaders through a more comprehensive product suite. This strategy has enabled us to effectively drive increased product penetration and PEPM growth at the initial point of sale, as well as stronger retention. We define “effective PEPM,” as recurring and other revenue for the period divided by the average number of customer employees, which we calculate as the sum of the number of customer employees at the end of each month over the period divided by the total number of months in the period. We intend to
25 advance this strategy by progressively expanding the breadth of features included in our product bundles. In addition to sales to new customers, there is a substantial opportunity within our existing customer base to cross-sell additional products from our portfolio, including Workforce Management, Benefits Administration and Talent Management.
Our ability to successfully increase revenue per customer is dependent upon several factors, including the number of employees working for our customers, the number of products purchased by each of our customers, our customers’ satisfaction with our solutions and support, and our ability to add new products to our suite.
We believe our ability to retain and expand our existing customers’ spending on our solutions is evidenced by our net revenue retention. We define net revenue retention as the current quarterly period recurring revenue for the cohort of customers at the beginning of the prior year quarterly period, divided by the recurring revenue in the prior year reporting period for that same cohort. In calculating the net revenue retention for a period longer than a quarter, such as a fiscal year, we use the weighted average of the retention rates (calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence) for each applicable quarter included in such period. Our net revenue retention has continued to trend favorably and is above historical pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Our net revenue retention had been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic by stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders, which resulted in reduced employee headcount, temporary and permanent business closures, and delayed sales and starts with many of our customers. Ongoing Product Innovation and Optimization
We believe that our product features and functionality are key differentiators of our offerings. We intend to continue to invest in research and development, particularly regarding the functionality of our platform, to sustain and advance our product leadership. For instance, in fiscal 2019, we acquired Ximble’s scheduling solution and in fiscal 2020, we released Paycor Analytics. In fiscal 2021, we released our compensation management product and a full suite of talent management tools, including performance reviews, one-on-one coaching, objectives and key results (“OKRs”) and structured goal setting. In fiscal 2022, we introduced OnDemand Pay, expense management and a Developer Portal to enhance Paycor’s industry-leading interoperability, making it even easier for clients and partners to seamlessly integrate and sync data between HR and third-party systems. We also released a new payroll-based journal reporting platform to simplify complex staffing reporting requirements for nursing facilities and a predictive resignation feature providing leaders with actionable insights to identify the top drivers of employee resignation. In fiscal 2023, we acquired Talenya’s intelligent candidate sourcing technology, now Paycor Smart Sourcing, to enhance our industry-leading talent management solution. We also introduced the COR Leadership Framework, empowering organizations to transform frontline managers into effective leaders through the provision of technology and expertise. As a result of these and other product launches, the total list PEPM and customer-perceived value for our full suite of products continues to increase. Our ability to innovate and introduce competitive new products is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain top technical talent and invest in research and development initiatives.
Components of Results of Operations
Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations IPO-Related Expenses In connection with our IPO, we incurred certain transaction-related expenses. These expenses include transaction bonuses, share-based compensation expense associated with two Long Term Incentive Plans (“LTIPs”) and outstanding performance awards under the Pride Aggregator, L.P. Management Equity Plan (“MEP”), and expenses related to the redemption of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock. The specifics of the LTIPs, MEP and Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock are presented below.
We granted Long Term Incentive Plan units (“LTIP Units”) under the Pride Aggregator, L.P. Top Talent Incentive Plan and Sales Equity Incentive Plan. In connection with our IPO, the LTIP Units converted into the entitlement to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock, based on the IPO price. We settled such entitlements by issuing restricted stock units, which vest on the applicable payment dates and we will recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period relating to the LTIP Units. Under the terms of the MEP, one-half of the MEP incentive units vest based on an associate’s service time. Vesting for the second half of the MEP incentive units is established based on our performance relative to the amount originally invested by Pride Aggregator L.P. (“Pride Aggregator”), the investment vehicle controlled by certain investment funds advised by Apax
26 Partners (the “Apax Funds”) through which the Apax Funds acquired their interest in us, with the performance calculations defined in the plan, which were triggered by our IPO (an implied performance condition).
Upon the closing of our IPO, and due to an election by Pride Aggregator, the MEP performance-based incentive units converted to time-based incentive units (“Modified MEP Incentive Units”), with 25% vesting upon successive six month anniversary dates for the 24 months beginning on the date of the IPO. The conversion was treated as a modification for accounting purposes, and accordingly, we estimated fair value as of the modification date. The Modified MEP Incentive Units are accounted for as equity awards and the compensation expense calculated based upon the fair value of the Modified MEP Incentive Units at the modification date is recognized as the Modified MEP Incentive Units vest. We estimate the fair value of the Modified MEP Incentive Units based upon the IPO price adjusted for a floor amount established at the grant date and other liquidation preferences in accordance with the terms of the MEP. We redeemed the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock in connection with, and using proceeds from, our IPO. The redemption price per share was equal to 101% of the liquidation preference, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date, or approximately $260.0 million.
See Note 12 - “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests” for more information. Basis of Presentation Revenues
Recurring and Other Revenue
We derive our revenue from contractual agreements, which contain recurring and non-recurring service fees. The majority of our contracts are cancellable by the customer on 30 days’ notice. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we are entitled to for those goods or services. Recurring revenue consists primarily of revenues derived from the provision of our payroll, workforce management, and HR-related cloud-based computing services. The performance obligations related to recurring services are generally satisfied monthly as services are provided, with fees charged and collected based on a PEPM or per-employee-per-payroll basis. Recurring revenue is generally recognized as the services are provided during each client’s payroll period. Other revenue and non-recurring services fees consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve onboarding and configuring the customer within our cloud-based platform. These nonrefundable implementation fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract, with revenue deferred and recognized over the period to which the material right exists. This is generally a period of 24 months from finalization of onboarding, which typically concludes within three to six months of the original booking. Deferred revenue also includes an immaterial portion related to recurring subscription services where revenue is recognized over the subscription period. Deferred revenue for these nonrefundable upfront fees and recurring subscription services was $17.0 million as of December 31, 2022, with $5.4 million and $10.1 million of revenue recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Deferred revenue for these nonrefundable upfront fees and recurring subscription services was $15.3 million as of December 31, 2021, with $5.3 million and $10.1 million of revenue recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
We defer certain commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria. We also capitalize certain costs to fulfill a contract related to our proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered. We utilize the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract.
Capitalized costs to fulfill a contract and cost to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is generally six years based on our average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. We do not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. We recognize additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. The additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services. We continue to expense certain costs to obtain a contract and cost to fulfill a contract if those costs do not meet the capitalization criteria.
We expect recurring and other revenue to increase as we continue to add new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers.
27 Interest Income on Funds Held for Clients
We earn interest income on funds held for clients. We generally collect substantially all funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through demand deposit accounts with financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house arrangements. We also earn interest by investing a portion of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. We expect funds held for our clients to generally grow as the employees per customer increase and as we add customers. Interest income on funds held for clients will fluctuate based on market rates of demand deposit accounts, as well as the highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities in which we invest the client funds.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues includes costs relating to the provision of ongoing customer support and implementation activities, payroll tax filing, distribution of printed checks and other materials providing our payroll and other HCM solutions. These costs primarily consist of employee-related expenses for associates who service customers, as well as third-party processing fees, delivery costs, hosting costs, and bank fees associated with client fund transfers. Costs for recurring support are generally expensed as incurred, while such costs for onboarding and configuring our products for our customers are capitalized and amortized over a period of six years.
We amortized $6.2 million and $4.1 million of capitalized contract fulfillment costs during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $11.8 million and $7.7 million of capitalized contract fulfillment costs during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to realize increased amortization in future periods as the total capitalized contract fulfillment costs on our balance sheet increases.
We also capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs including external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software and certain payroll and payroll-related costs for associates who are directly associated with internal-use software projects, which are then generally amortized over a period of three years into cost of revenues. We amortized $8.0 million and $10.2 million of capitalized internal-use and acquired software costs during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $15.6 million and $26.8 million of capitalized internal-use and acquired software costs during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our cost of revenues is expected to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our customer base. However, in the long-term we expect cost of revenues to reduce as a percentage of total revenues as our business scales.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, marketing, advertising and promotion expenses, including amortization expense associated with the naming rights agreement, and other related costs. We capitalize certain commission costs related to new contracts or purchases of additional services by our existing customers and amortize such items over a period of six years. We amortized $4.9 million and $3.4 million of capitalized contract acquisition costs during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $9.3 million and $6.4 million of capitalized contract acquisition costs during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to realize increased amortization in future periods as the total capitalized contract acquisition costs on our balance sheet increases.
We seek to grow our number of new customers and upsell existing customers, and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities.
General and Administrative
28 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our administrative, finance, accounting, legal, enterprise technology and human resources departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance, and other corporate expenses. We amortized $22.1 million and $20.5 million of intangible assets, excluding acquired software amortized through cost of revenues, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $43.4 million and $40.8 million of intangible assets, excluding acquired software amortized through cost of revenues, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in amortization expense in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to our asset acquisition in February 2021.
We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we grow and scale our business. Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our software development and product management staff. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies, and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, including costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
We capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software, which are amortized over a period of three years into cost of revenues. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the following periods:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Capitalized software $ 9,139  $ 6,437  $ 17,742  $ 13,678  Research and development expenses $ 13,875  $ 10,605  $ 26,277  $ 20,796  We expect to increase our research and development expenses in absolute dollars as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing customers.   Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest payments and accruals relating to outstanding borrowings as well as accretion expense associated with the naming rights liability. We expect interest expense to vary each reporting period depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings and prevailing interest rates.
Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) generally consists of other income and expense items outside of our normal operations, such as realized gains or losses on the sale of certain positions of funds held for clients, gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt and expenses relating to our financing arrangements.

Additionally, interest income on funds held for clients accounted for $7.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of a 3.4% increase in customers to approximately 30,000 at December 31, 2022 from approximately 29,000 at December 31, 2021, an increase in the average number of employees per customer, an increase in effective PEPM and an increase in interest income on funds held for clients as discussed below. Interest income on funds held for clients increased primarily as a result of higher average daily balances for funds held due to the addition of new customers and higher average interest rates across our portfolio of debt-security investments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
34 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin
We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and certain corporate expenses, in each case that are included in costs of recurring revenues. We define Adjusted Gross Profit Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by total revenues.
We use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends. We believe these metrics are useful measures to us and to our investors to assist in evaluating our core operating performance because it provides consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metrics eliminate the effects of variability of items such as stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets, which are non-cash expenses that may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as replacements for gross profit and gross profit margin, as determined by U.S. GAAP, or as measures of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. Adjusted Gross Profit was $90.1 million and $68.7 million, or 67.8% and 66.6% of total revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adjusted Gross Profit was $168.5 million and $129.2 million, or 67.1% and 66.0% of total revenues, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adjusted Gross Profit increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the increase in revenue from customer growth, partially offset by additional employee-related costs to support new customers, amortization of costs to fulfill contracts within cost of revenues and amortization of capitalized software.

35 Adjusted Operating Income
We define Adjusted Operating Income as loss from operations before amortization of acquired intangible assets and naming rights, stock-based compensation expense, exit cost due to exiting leases of certain facilities and other certain corporate expenses, such as costs related to acquisitions. We define Adjusted Operating Income Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by total revenues.
We use Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin facilitate comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense relating to intangible assets is excluded from Adjusted Operating Income, the revenue related to such intangible assets is reflected in Adjusted Operating Income as these assets contribute to our revenue generation.
Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin should not be considered as replacements for operating loss and operating loss margin, as determined by U.S. GAAP, or as measures of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.
Adjusted Operating Income was $17.6 million and $10.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adjusted Operating Income was $28.1 million and $13.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adjusted Operating Income increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in total revenues, partially offset by continued investment in employee-related costs to support new customers, expand our sales coverage, and develop our products, as well as increased amortization related to deferred contract costs and capitalized software.

We define Adjusted Sales and Marketing expense as sales and marketing expenses before amortization of naming rights, stock-based compensation expense and other certain corporate expenses. We define Adjusted General and Administrative expense as general and administrative expenses before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, exit costs due to exiting leases of certain facilities and other certain corporate expenses. We define Adjusted Research and Development expense as research and development expenses before stock-based compensation expense and other certain corporate expenses.
We use Adjusted Sales and Marketing expense, Adjusted General and Administrative expense and Adjusted Research and Development expense (collectively, “Adjusted Operating Expenses”) to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Adjusted Operating Expenses facilitate comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations.
Adjusted Operating Expenses have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Expenses should not be considered as replacements for operating expenses, as determined by U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.
Adjusted Sales and Marketing expense was $42.0 million and $32.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $81.9 million and $64.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Corporate adjustments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 relate to certain restructuring costs of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as well as costs associated with becoming a public company, including the implementation of a new enterprise-resource planning system and professional, consulting, and other costs of $0.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and costs associated with the October 2021 Secondary Offering of $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. as loss before benefit for income tax after adjusting for amortization of acquired intangible assets and naming rights, accretion expense associated with the naming rights, stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt, exit cost due to exiting leases of certain facilities and other certain corporate expenses, such as costs related to acquisitions, all of which are tax effected by applying an adjusted effective income tax rate. We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. divided by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted shares outstanding includes potentially dilutive securities excluded from the U.S. GAAP dilutive net loss per share calculation. We use Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share facilitate comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense relating to intangible assets is excluded from Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc., the revenue related to such intangible assets is reflected in Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. as these assets contribute to our revenue generation.
Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of
38 our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. should not be considered as a replacement for Net Loss Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc., and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. Per Share should not be considered as a replacement for diluted net loss attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. per share, as determined by U.S. GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.
Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. was $13.6 million and $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was $21.9 million and $10.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Paycor HCM, Inc. increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in total revenues, partially offset by continued investment in employee-related costs to support new customers, expand our sales coverage, and develop our products, as well as increased amortization related to deferred contract costs and capitalized software.

Corporate adjustments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 relate to costs associated with the December 2022 Secondary Offering and the September 2022 Secondary Offering of $0.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, professional, consulting, and other costs of $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, and transaction expenses and other costs of $1.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Corporate adjustments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 relate to certain restructuring costs of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as well as costs associated with becoming a public company, including the implementation of a new enterprise-resource planning system and professional, consulting, and other costs of $0.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and costs associated with the October 2021 Secondary Offering of $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. ***
Non-GAAP adjusted income before applicable income taxes is tax effected using an adjusted effective income tax rate of 23.0% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and 24.0% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. ****
The adjusted shares outstanding for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are based on the if-converted method and include potentially dilutive securities that are excluded from the U.S. GAAP dilutive net income per share calculation because including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. The adjusted shares outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2021 are based on the if-converted method and include potentially dilutive securities that are excluded from the U.S. GAAP dilutive net income per share calculation because including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. The adjusted shares outstanding for the six months ended December 31, 2021 assume the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock as if it would have occurred on July 1, 2021, based on the if-converted method and include potentially dilutive securities that are excluded from the U.S. GAAP dilutive net income per share calculation because including them would have an anti-dilutive effect.
39 Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $72.3 million, which was held for working capital purposes, as well as $200.0 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, described further below. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents principally included demand deposit accounts. We expect our operating cash flows to further improve as we increase our operational efficiency and experience economies of scale.
We have historically financed our operations primarily through cash received from operations and debt financing and, more recently, with the issuance of equity in our IPO. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and cash provided by sales of our solutions and services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, and the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights.
We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.
The majority of the Company’s recurring fees are satisfied over time as the services are provided and invoiced by the customer payroll processing period or by month. The Company recognizes deferred revenue for nonrefundable upfront fees as well as for subscription services related to certain ancillary products invoiced prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligation. As of December 31, 2022, we had deferred revenue of $17.0 million, of which $11.4 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next twelve months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Revolving Credit Facility
Paycor, Inc. is party to a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), Fifth Third, National Association, and other lenders, providing a
$200.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility includes an “accordion feature” that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional principal amount of up to $200.0 million, with a resulting maximum principal amount of $400.0 million, subject to the participating lenders electing to increase their commitments or new lenders being added to the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on June 11, 2026. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, have variable interest rates. The variable interest rates equal, at our option, either, (i) in the case of ABR borrowings, the highest of (a) the PNC prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, and (c) the adjusted London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) with a maturity of one month, plus 1.00% (“ABR”) or (ii) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of (A) prior to the IPO, (i) in the case of ABR borrowings, 0.95% per annum and (ii) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 1.95% per annum or (B) following the IPO, (i) in the case of ABR borrowings, 0.375% per annum or (ii) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 1.375% per annum, in each case, with step downs based on achievement of certain total leverage ratios. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis, including a total leverage ratio financial covenant of 3.50 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio financial covenant of 3.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 40   Cash Flows
The following table presents a summary of our unaudited condensed consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Six Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net cash used in operating activities $ (18,498) $ (18,724) Net cash used in investing activities (151,332) (16,035) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (524,960) 413,341  Impact of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents (6) 63  Net change in cash and cash equivalents (694,796) 378,645  Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 1,682,923  560,000  Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 988,127  $ 938,645  Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $18.5 million and $18.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in operating activities for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 reflects a decrease in changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net loss and an increase in adjustments to add back non-cash items. Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $151.3 million and $16.0 million, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the timing of proceeds and purchases within our client funds portfolio as well as our acquisition of Talenya. Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $525.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and consisted primarily of a decrease in funds held to satisfy client fund obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $413.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of an increase in funds held to satisfy client fund obligations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock sold in our IPO, net of offering costs, partially offset by cash used for the redemption of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock and increased net repayments of long-term debt. Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our principal commitments at December 31, 2022 primarily consist of leases for office space. Except for the naming rights agreement, which is discussed in “Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in the contractual obligations section of Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on 10-K that was filed with the SEC on August 24, 2022 (“Form 10-K”). For additional information regarding our leases, long-term debt and our commitments and contingencies, see “Note 10. Leases”, “Note 9. Debt Agreements and Letters of Credit” and “Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies” in the Form 10-K and “Note 9. Debt Agreements and Letters of Credit” and “Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors.
41 JOBS Act
We currently qualify as an “emerging growth company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our annual reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.
The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to “opt-in” to this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis.
Effective June 30, 2023 (which is the last day of our fiscal year 2023), we will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as a result of the aggregate value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as measured on the last day of our second fiscal quarter (December 31, 2022) being at least $700.0 million, and therefore, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, as discussed above, and will be required to transition to the reporting and other corporate governance requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.
Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. Management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Form 10-K, except as described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements: “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements: “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Pending Accounting Pronouncements” appearing elsewhere in this report.
Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation or interest rates. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the respective local currencies. Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily
42 in the United States, Canada, and Serbia. Our unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $72.3 million and funds held for clients of $1,183.5 million. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents and significant portions of our funds held for clients in demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions. We invest funds held for clients in debt-security investments classified as available-for-sale consisting of U.S. Treasury Notes, direct obligations of U.S. government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Farm Credit Bank, high grade corporate bonds, FDIC insured certificates of deposit, and other short-term and long-term investments.
Our cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates would decrease our interest income earned. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may cause the market value of our investments in fixed-rate available-for-sale securities to decline. We may incur losses on our fixed-rate available-for-sale securities if we are forced to sell some or all of these securities at lower market values. However, as a result of us classifying all marketable securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates until such securities are sold or decreases in fair value are deemed to be other-than-temporary. We have not recorded any other-than-temporary impairment losses to date. A 100-basis point change in interest rates would have had an immaterial effect on the market value of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022.
We are also exposed to changing Eurodollar-based interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including European Union and U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. Our Revolving Credit Facility carries interest at LIBOR, as administered by the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration for deposits in dollar, plus the applicable margin. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding debt under our Revolving Credit Facility and, as a result, a 100-basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve-month period would result in no change to interest expense. Impact of Inflation
While inflation may impact our revenues and costs of revenues, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, have not had a direct, material impact on our results of operations and financial condition to date. Nonetheless, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. There can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.
In the event the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to combat inflation, we could potentially benefit from increased interest income on our funds held for clients balance invested at higher interest rates. However, the cost to us of any future borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility would increase in a rising interest rate environment since borrowings under that facility bear interest at variable rates at the Company’s option based on certain benchmark interest rates (e.g. the Federal funds rate or LIBOR) plus a spread, or if higher, the prime rate.
As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 43 We have established disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis to management and the Board of Directors. No control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”), evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
44 Part II - Other Information Item 1.
Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, we believe would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or liquidity. For additional information, see “Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies.” Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the information set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 24, 2022. Item 2.
