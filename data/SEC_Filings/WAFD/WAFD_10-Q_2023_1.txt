Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Company and Nature of Operations
- Washington Federal Bank, a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank (the “Bank” or “WaFd Bank”), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate. Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation, was formed as the Bank’s holding company in November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms “Washington Federal” or the “Company” or “we” or “us” and “our” refer to Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term “Bank” refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Bank conducts its activities through a network of
200
bank branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas.
Basis of Presentation
- The Company has prepared the consolidated unaudited interim financial statements included in this report. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 18, 2022 ("2022 Annual Financial Statements"). Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements are disclosed in its 2022 Annual Financial Statements. There have not been any significant changes in the Company's significant accounting policies compared to those contained in its 2022 Annual Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. Preferred Stock
- On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued
300,000
shares of
4.875 % Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were $ 293,325,000 . The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of
12,000,000
depositary shares, each representing a 1/40 th
interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $ 25.00
per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "WAFDP." The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026. Restricted Cash Balances
- Based on the level of vault cash on hand, the Company was not required to maintain cash reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company held counterparty cash collateral of $ 280,400,000
and pledged cash collateral to counterparties of $ 284,400,000 , respectively, related to derivative contracts. Equity Securities
- The Company records equity securities within Other assets in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These equity investments are accounted for under different methods.
• Low-income housing tax credit investments are accounted for under the proportional amortization method in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-01,
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) . • For other equity investments where the Company has significant influence, the Company applies the equity method of accounting, which adjusts the carrying value of the investment to recognize a proportionate share of the financial results of the investment entity, regardless of whether any distribution is made. Any adjustments to the fair value of these investments are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
• For other equity investments where neither ASU 2014-01 nor the equity method of accounting is applicable, the Company applies the fair value adjustment method of ASU 2016-01,
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) . Any adjustments to the fair value of these investments are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair value is determined by reference to readily
9 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
determinable market values if applicable. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values (non-marketable) are generally accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable transactions involving the same or similar investments from the same issuer, also referred to as the measurement alternative. Under the NAV expedient for fair value measurement, equity investments in qualified real estate funds can use the net asset value (“NAV”) determined by the fund as fair value for the investment. At December 31, 2022, equity investments held by the Company and recorded at NAV had a carrying amount of $ 38,385,000
and a remaining unfunded commitment of $ 7,511,000 . These NAV based investments cannot be transferred without consent and we do not have redemption rights. Equity investments measured at NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Allowance for Credit Losses (Loans Receivable)
- The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio as well as unfunded loan commitments. The amount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by management. The current expected credit loss methodology (“CECL”) requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) and replaces the incurred loss methodology’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The ACL consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period that historical experience was based for each loan type. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable.
Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. The Company has designated
two
loan portfolio segments, commercial loans and consumer loans. These loan portfolio segments are further disaggregated into classes, which represent loans of similar type, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and assessing credit risk. The commercial loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into
five
classes: multi-family, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, and land acquisition and development. The risk of loss for the commercial loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by the credit risk rating assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are determined by experienced senior credit officers based on specific facts and circumstances and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The consumer loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into
five
classes: single-family-residential mortgage, custom construction, consumer lot loans, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer. The risk of loss for the consumer loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by delinquency status and general economic factors. Each commercial and consumer loan portfolio class may also be further segmented based on risk characteristics. For most of our loan portfolio classes, the historical loss experience is determined using a cohort methodology. This method pools loans into groups (“cohorts”) sharing similar risk characteristics and tracks each cohort’s net charge-offs over the lives of the loans to calculate a historical loss rate. The historical loss rates for each cohort are then averaged to calculate an overall historical loss rate which is applied to the current loan balance to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the respective loan portfolio class. For certain loan portfolio classes, the Company determined there was not sufficient historical loss information to calculate a meaningful historical loss rate using the cohort methodology. For any such loan portfolio class, the weighted-average remaining maturity (“WARM”) methodology is being utilized until sufficient historical loss data is obtained. The WARM method multiplies an average annual loss rate by the expected remaining life of the loan pool to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the respective loan portfolio class.
The Company also considers qualitative adjustments to the historical loss rate for each loan portfolio class. The qualitative adjustments for each loan class consider the conditions over the period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management factors and 2) reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions and collateral values.
The Company performs a quarterly asset quality review which includes a review of forecasted gross charge-offs and recoveries, nonperforming assets, criticized loans, risk rating migration, delinquencies, etc. The asset quality review is performed by
10 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
management and the results are used to consider a qualitative overlay to the quantitative baseline. The second qualitative adjustment noted above, economic conditions and collateral values, encompasses a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overlay adjustment for the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes an immediate reversion after the one-year forecast period to historical loss rates for the remaining life of the respective loan pool.
When management deems it to be appropriate, the Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in each respective loan pool. These individually evaluated loans are removed from their respective pools and typically represent collateral dependent loans but may also include other non-performing loans or troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). In addition, the Company individually evaluates “reasonably expected” TDRs, which are identified by the Company as a loan expected to be classified as a TDR within the next six months. Management judgment is utilized to make this determination. Allowance for Credit Losses (Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)
- For held-to-maturity (“HTM”) debt securities, the Company is required to utilize a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses. Substantially all of the Company’s HTM debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss.
See Note F
"Fair Value Measurements" for more information about HTM debt securities. Allowance for Credit Losses (Available-for-Sale Debt Securities)
- The impairment model for available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities differs from the CECL methodology applied for HTM debt securities because AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities where neither of the criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the credit rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any remaining discount that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision (or recapture of) for credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
See Note F
"Fair Value Measurements" for more information about AFS debt securities. Accrued Interest Receivable
- The Company made the following elections regarding accrued interest receivable (“AIR”): • Presenting accrued interest receivable balances separately from their underlying instruments within the consolidated statements of financial condition. • Excluding accrued interest receivable that is included in the amortized cost of financing receivables from related disclosure requirements. • Continuing our policy to write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income in cases where the Company does not reasonably expect to receive payment.
• Not measuring an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable due to the Company’s policy of writing off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner, as described above. Non-Accrual Loans
- Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than 90 days past due, and the Bank expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet contractual obligations. 11 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

If a consumer loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status. If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and management concludes that full repayment is probable based on internal evaluation, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring. If the restructured consumer loan does not perform, it is placed on non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances, after the required six consecutive payments are made, management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual status. Collateral-Dependent Loans
- A financial asset is considered collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. For all classes of loans and leases deemed collateral-dependent, the Company elected the practical expedient to estimate expected credit losses based on the collateral’s fair value less cost to sell. In most cases, the Company records a partial charge-off to reduce the loan’s carrying value to the collateral’s fair value less cost to sell. Substantially all of the collateral consists of various types of real estate including residential properties; commercial properties such as retail centers, office buildings, and lodging; agriculture land; and vacant land. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures
- The only material off-balance-sheet credit exposures are unfunded loan commitments, which had a combined balance of $ 4,822,769,000
and $ 4,947,570,000
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
The reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized as a liability (other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition), with adjustments to the reserve recognized through provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. The reserve for unfunded commitments represents the expected lifetime credit losses on off-balance sheet obligations such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws, including the effects of risk mitigation actions, and applying the expected loss rates on those draws. Loss rates are estimated by utilizing the same loss rates calculated for the allowance for credit losses related to the respective loan portfolio class.

New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).
The amendments in this ASU provide temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The ASU primarily includes relief related to contract modifications and hedging relationships, as well as providing a one-time election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. This guidance is effective immediately and the amendments were originally to be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022.
However, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, deferring the sunset date to December 31, 2024. The Company has evaluated the regulatory requirements to cease the use of LIBOR and has put in place systems and capabilities for this purpose. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) . The amendments in this ASU clarify the guidance on ASC 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios and financial assets. Among other things, the amended guidance establishes the "last-of-layer" method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible and renames that method the "portfolio layer" method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the amendments to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The amendments in this ASU eliminate the guidance on troubled debt restructurings while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The ASU also requires that entities disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for loans and leases. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the amendments to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 12 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Most TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request for modification is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession granted in a loan modification is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of between
100
to
200
basis points for a specific term, usually
six
to
twenty-four months . Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans. As of December 31, 2022,
98.0 % of the Company's $ 55,515,000
in TDRs were classified as performing. As of December 31, 2022, single-family residential loans comprised
82.5 % of TDRs.
We evaluate the credit quality of our loans based on regulatory risk ratings and also consider other factors. Based on this evaluation, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows: • Pass
– the credit does not meet one of the definitions below. • Special mention
– A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. • Substandard
– A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard. • Doubtful
– A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. • Loss
– Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are identified as uncollectible. Partial charge-off versus full charge-off may be taken if the collateral offers some identifiable protection. 16 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company recorded a $ 2,500,000
provision for credit losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with a provision for credit losses of $ 500,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The provision in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to reserving for growth in loans receivable largely offset by improvements in management's assessment of the credit quality of certain loan portfolios. The provision for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to reserving for growth in loans receivable and changes in composition of the loan portfolio. Recoveries, net of charge-offs, totaled $ 489,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $ 2,111,000
during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Non-performing assets were $ 38,650,000 , or
0.18 % of total assets, at December 31, 2022, compared to $ 44,554,000 , or
0.21 % of total assets, at September 30, 2022. Non-accrual loans were $ 29,180,000
at December 31, 2022, compared to $ 34,534,000
at September 30, 2022. Delinquencies, as a percent of total loans, were
0.16 % at December 31, 2022, compared to
0.17 % at September 30, 2022. The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as described in
Note D
"Loans Receivable." The following tables provide the amortized cost of loans receivable based on risk rating categories as previously defined.

NOTE F –
Fair Value Measurements FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1:
Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active exchange markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2:
Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3:
Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company has established and documented the process for determining the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value is determined using valuation models or third-party appraisals. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure and report the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Measured on a Recurring Basis Available-for-Sale Securities and Derivative Contracts Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of debt securities are priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and under GAAP are considered a Level 2 input method. Securities that are traded on active exchanges are measured using the closing price in an active market and are considered a Level 1 input method. The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counter party to offset its interest rate risk. The Company has also entered into commercial loan hedges, mortgage pool hedges and borrowings hedges using interest rate swaps. The fair value of these interest rate swaps are estimated by a third-party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique. These are considered a Level 2 input method.   25 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as collateral dependent loans and real estate owned ("REO"). REO consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure. From time to time, and on a nonrecurring basis, adjustments using fair value measurements are recorded to reflect increases or decreases based on the discounted cash flows, the current appraisal or estimated value of the collateral or REO property. When management determines that the fair value of the collateral or the REO requires additional adjustments, either as a result of an updated appraised value or when there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the collateral dependent loan or real estate owned as Level 3. Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2022 included loans for which an allowance was established or a partial charge-off was recorded based on the fair value of collateral, as well as real estate owned where the fair value of the property was less than the cost basis. The following tables present the aggregated balance of assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the total gains (losses) resulting from those fair value adjustments during the respective periods. The estimated fair value measurements are shown gross of estimated selling costs.     December 31, 2022 Three Months Ended December 31, 2022   Level 1 Level  2 Level  3 Total Total Gains (Losses)   (In thousands) (In thousands) Loans (1) $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ ( 123 ) Real estate owned (2) —   —   —   —   —   Balance at end of period $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ ( 123 ) (1) The gains (losses) represent re-measurements of collateral-dependent loans.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825") requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate those values. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates presented do not reflect the underlying fair value of the Company.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would materially affect the estimated fair value amounts presented below, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since the dates shown, and therefore, estimates of fair value subsequent to those dates may differ significantly from the amounts presented below. 27 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

– The carrying amount of these items is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.   Available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities
– Securities at fair value are primarily priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and are considered a Level 2 input method. Equity securities that are exchange traded are considered a Level 1 input method. Loans receivable
– Fair values are estimated first by stratifying the portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as multi-family real estate, residential mortgage, construction, commercial, consumer and land loans. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed- and adjustable-rate interest terms. For residential mortgages and multi-family loans, the bank determined that its best exit price was by securitization. MBS benchmark prices are used as a base price, with further loan level pricing adjustments made based on individual loan characteristics such as FICO score, LTV, Property Type and occupancy. For all other loan categories an estimate of fair value is then calculated based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate offered and observed in the market on similar products, plus an adjustment for liquidity to reflect the non-homogeneous nature of the loans, as well as an annual loss rate based on historical losses to arrive at an estimated exit price fair value. Fair value for impaired loans is also based on recent appraisals or estimated cash flows discounted using rates

commensurate with risk associated with the estimated cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information. FHLB and FRB stock
– The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock that equates to its carrying value. Time deposits
– The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. FHLB advances
– The fair value of FHLB advances and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities. Interest rate swaps
– The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counterparty to offset its interest rate risk. The Company also uses interest rate swaps for various fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. The fair value of these interest rate swaps is estimated by a third-party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique.

Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. The Company does not believe that the AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position have any credit loss impairment as of December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. AFS debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Corporate debt securities and municipal bonds are considered to have an issuer of high credit quality (rated AA or higher) and the decline in fair value is due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuer continues to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity. 31 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

These arrangements include hedges of individual fixed rate commercial loans and also hedges of a specified portion of pools of prepayable fixed rate mortgage loans under the "last of layer" method. These relationships qualify as fair value hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"), which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the respective interest rate swap and the hedged items. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.
Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. The hedge basis adjustment remains with the hedged item until the hedged item is de-recognized from the balance sheet.
The following tables present the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the hedged items at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert certain short-term borrowings to fixed rate payments. The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of changes in future cash flows resulting from increasing interest rates. For qualifying cash flow hedges under ASC 815, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the maturities for hedges of adjustable rate borrowings ranged from
two years
to
eight years , with the weighted average being
6.3
years.

Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client’s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. There was
no
net impact to the statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as the changes in fair value of the receive fixed swap and pay fixed swap offset each other.

NOTE H –
Revenue from Contracts with Customers Since net interest income on financial assets and liabilities is outside the scope of ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
("ASC 606"), a significant majority of our revenues are not subject to that guidance. Revenue streams that are within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within non-interest income and are, in general, recognized as revenue at the same time the Company's obligation to the customer is satisfied. Most of the Company's customer contracts that are within the scope of the new guidance are cancelable by either party without penalty and are short-term in nature. These sources of revenue include depositor and other consumer and business banking fees, commission income, as well as debit and credit card interchange fees. In scope revenue streams represented approximately  3.9 % of our total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to
5.6 % for the three months ended December 31, 2021. As this standard is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has omitted certain disclosures in ASC 606, including the disaggregation of revenue table. Sources of non-interest income within the scope of the guidance include the following: Deposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit fee income)
- The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashier’s checks. The Company’s performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts. Debit and Credit Card Interchange Fees (recognized in Deposit fee income)
- The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card or credit card payment network based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement, so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment network in this case). Insurance Agency Commissions (recognized in Other income)
- WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Federal Bank, N.A. that operates as an insurance agency, selling and marketing property and casualty insurance policies for a small number of high-quality insurance carriers. WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. earns revenue in the form of commissions paid by the insurance carriers for policies that have been sold. In addition to the origination commission, WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. may also receive contingent incentive fees based on the volume of business generated for the insurance carrier and based on policy renewal rates.
NOTE I –
Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments
-
The Company’s lease commitments consist primarily of real estate property for branches and office space under various non-cancellable operating leases that expire between 2023 and 2070. The majority of the leases contain renewal options and provisions for increases in rental rates based on a predetermined schedule or an agreed upon index. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
- The only material off-balance-sheet credit exposures are unfunded loan commitments, which had a combined balance of $ 4,822,769,000
and $ 4,947,570,000
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The reserve was $ 31,500,000
as of December 31, 2022, which is an decrease from $ 32,500,000
at September 30, 2022.
See Note A
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for details regarding the reserve methodology. Legal Proceedings
- The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time defendants in and are threatened with various legal proceedings arising from regular business activities. Management, after consulting with legal counsel, is of the opinion that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these pending or threatened actions and proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company. 35 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

GENERAL & BUSINESS DESCRIPTION Washington Federal Bank, a federally-insured national bank dba WaFd Bank (the “Bank” or “WaFd Bank”), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate.
Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation was formed as the Bank’s holding company in November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms “Washington Federal,” the “Company” or “we” or “us” and “our” refer to the Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term “Bank” refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.
On January 3, 2022, the Bank announced that it had applied to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (the "WDFI") to convert from a national association to a non-Federal Reserve member Washington state-chartered bank. The Bank completed the conversion of its charter from a national bank charter, supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to a Washington state chartered commercial bank effective February 4, 2022. The Bank cancelled its holdings of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as part of the conversion and its legal name changed from “Washington Federal Bank, National Association” to “Washington Federal Bank.” As a result of the conversion, the WDFI is the Bank's primary state regulator and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") is the Bank's primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve will continue to regulate the Bank's holding company, Washington Federal, Inc. 37 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 18, 2022. INTEREST RATE RISK Based on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing shorter-term loans and transaction deposit accounts, to reduce its interest rate risk profile. The mix of transaction and savings accounts is 79% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022 while the composition of the investment securities portfolio is 39% variable and 61% fixed rate. When interest rates rise, the fair value of the investment securities with fixed rates will decrease and vice versa when interest rates decline. The Company has $453,443,000 of mortgage-backed securities that it has designated as HTM and are carried at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2022, the net unrealized loss on these securities was $51,388,000. The Company has $2,059,837,000 of AFS securities that are carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2022, the net unrealized loss on these securities was $118,880,000. The Company has executed interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk on certain FHLB borrowings. The unrealized gain on these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2022 was $173,139,000. All of the above are pre-tax net unrealized gains or losses.
The Company relies on various measures of interest rate risk, including an asset/liability analysis, modeling of changes in forecasted net interest income under various rate change scenarios, and the impact of interest rate changes on the net portfolio value (“NPV”) of the Company. Net Interest Income Sensitivity
- The Company estimates the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 0.4% in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 1.9% as of the September 30, 2022 analysis. The change between periods is primarily due to a shift in the yield curve as well as shifts in the mix of fixed versus adjustable rate assets and liabilities. Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short term rates and 100 basis points in long-term rates over two years would result in a net interest income decrease of 13.8% in the first year and decrease of 12.2% in the second year assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention. Alternatively, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 100 basis points in both short and long-term interest rates estimates that net interest income would increase by 2.54%. NPV Sensitivity
- NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity. NPV is calculated as the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-paying liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of NPV to changes in interest rates provides a view of interest rate risk as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decrease by $662,443,000 or 23.4% and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to 11.2% from a base of 13.7%.
As of September 30, 2022, the NPV in the event of a 200 basis point increase in rates was estimated to decrease by $617,000,000 or 20.9% and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to 12.6% from a base of 14.9%. The change in NPV sensitivity over the quarter is due primarily to changes in interest rates and the related
38 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES impact on asset prices and sensitivity to expected prepayment speeds on fixed rate loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as changes in the mix of fixed versus adjustable rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022.
Prepayment speeds are historically low at
December 31, 2022.
For example, the Bank's conditional payment rate ("CPR") for single family mortgages has fallen to 6.3% from 25.0% the year before.
As of December 31, 2022, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates is estimated to increase NPV by $283,953,000 or 10.0% and the NPV to total assets ratio to grow to 14.6% from a base of 13.7%. Interest Rates
- The Company measures the difference between the rate on total interest-earning assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each period. This period-end interest rate spread was 3.17% at December 31, 2022 and 3.36% at September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average period-end rate on interest-earning assets increased by 42 basis points to 4.46% compared to September 30, 2022, while the weighted average period-end rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 61 basis points to 1.29%. The period-end interest rate spread increased to 3.17% at December 31, 2022 from 2.48% at December 31, 2021 as the weighted average period-end rate on interest-earning assets increased by 163 basis points while the weighted average period-end rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 94 basis points. Net Interest Margin
- Net interest margin is measured as net interest income divided by average earning assets for the period. Net interest margin was 3.69% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.87% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 149 basis points to 4.71% and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 86 basis points to 1.31% over that same period. The higher yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to the impact of rising rates on adjustable rate assets and cash. The higher rate in interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from customer deposits repricing and a higher rate on FHLB borrowings.
The following table sets forth the information explaining the changes in the net interest margin for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022, loans receivable increased $880,024,000 and FHLB stock increased by $38,000,000 while cash and cash equivalents decreased by $38,103,000 and investment securities decreased by $1,056,000.
The growth in loans receivable during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily funded by the increase in FHLB advances during the period. Cash and cash equivalents of $645,862,000 and shareholders’ equity of $2,324,381,000 as of December 31, 2022 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk going forward. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, repayments and sales of investments and borrowings and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services.
On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875% Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were $293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WAFDP.” The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026. The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") of up to 45% of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides a substantial source of additional liquidity.
The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term loan agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program.
Customer account balances have remained stable, decreasing only $69,535,000, or 0.4%, to $15,960,035,000 at December 31, 2022 compared with $16,029,570,000 at September 30, 2022. Total FHLB borrowings totaled $3,075,000,000 as of December 31, 2022 an increase from $2,125,000,000 at September 30, 2022. The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $645,862,000 at December 31, 2022, a decrease from $683,965,000 at September 30, 2022. These amounts include the Bank's operating cash.
The Company’s shareholders' equity at December 31, 2022 was $2,324,381,000, or 10.73% of total assets. This is an increase of $50,121,000 from September 30, 2022 when shareholders' equity was $2,274,260,000, or 10.95% of total assets. The Company’s shareholders' equity was impacted in the three months ended December 31, 2022 by net income of $79,509,000, the payment of $15,585,000 in common stock dividends, payment of $3,656,000 in preferred stock dividends, treasury stock purchases of $1,728,000, as well as the other comprehensive loss of $10,755,000. The ratio of tangible capital to tangible assets at December 31, 2022 was 9.44%. Management believes the Company's strong equity position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment. Washington Federal, Inc. and its banking subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.
Federal banking agencies establish regulatory capital rules that require minimum capital ratios and establish criteria for calculating regulatory capital. Minimum capital ratios for four measures are used for assessing capital adequacy. The standards are indicated in the table below.
The common equity tier 1 capital ratio recognizes common equity as the highest form of capital. The denominator for all except the leverage ratio is risk weighted assets. The rules set forth a “capital conservation
40 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES buffer” of up to 2.5%. In the event that a bank’s capital levels fall below the minimum ratios plus these buffers, the bank's regulators may place restrictions on it. These restrictions include reducing dividend payments, share buy-backs, and staff bonus payments. The purpose of these buffers is to require banks to build up capital outside of periods of stress that can be drawn down during periods of stress. As a result, even during periods where losses are incurred, the minimum capital ratios can still be met.
There are also standards for Adequate and Well Capitalized criteria that are used for “Prompt Corrective Action” purposes. To remain categorized as well capitalized, the Bank and the Company must maintain minimum common equity risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.

- Cash and cash equivalents were $645,862,000 at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $38,103,000, or 5.6%, since September 30, 2022. The change is primarily due to funding of new loan originations. Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities
- AFS securities increased $8,800,000, or 0.4%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, mostly due to securities purchases of $115,909,000 offset by principal repayments and
41 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES maturities of $100,340,000. During the same period, the balance of HTM securities decreased by $9,856,000 primarily due to principal pay-downs and maturities of $9,793,000. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a net unrealized loss on AFS securities of $118,880,000, which is included on a net of tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The majority of the Company’s HTM and AFS debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for HTM securities as of December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022 as the investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities that management deems to have immaterial risk of loss. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. The Company does not believe that any of its AFS debt securities had credit loss impairment as of December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022, therefore, no allowance was recorded.
Loans receivable
- Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, increased by $880,024,000 to $16,993,588,000 at December 31, 2022, compared to $16,113,564,000 at September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily the net result of originations of $2,042,678,000, purchases of single-family residential mortgages of $77,484,000, partially offset by loan principal repayments of $1,233,319,000. Commercial loan originations accounted for 84% of total originations and consumer loan originations were 16% during the period. The mix of loan originations is consistent with management's strategy to produce more multifamily, commercial real estate, construction and commercial and industrial loans that generally have adjustable interest rates or a shorter duration.

The change is primarily due to a $5,354,000 decrease in non-accrual loans. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.18% at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.21% at September 30, 2022.

The Company would have recognized interest income of $358,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. Recognized interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was higher than what otherwise would have been recognized in the period due to the collection of past due amounts. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had $252,828,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at December 31, 2022 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total NPAs and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 1.60% at December 31, 2022. 43 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Restructured single-family residential loans are reserved for under the Company’s general reserve methodology. If any individual loan is significant in balance, the Company may establish a specific reserve as warranted.   Most restructured loans are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. Single-family residential loans comprised 82.5% of restructured loans as of December 31, 2022. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twenty-four months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.
For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are generally required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances after the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment will conclude that collection of the entire principal balance is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual. Homogeneous loans may or may not be on accrual status at the time of restructuring, but all are placed on accrual status upon the restructuring of the loan. Homogeneous loans are restructured only if the borrower can demonstrate the ability to meet the restructured payment terms; otherwise, collection is pursued and the loan remains on non-accrual status until liquidated. If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it will be placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company’s delinquency trend, which is part of the qualitative risk factors component of the allowance for credit losses calculation. Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the historical loss factors component of the Company's general reserve calculation. Allowance for credit losses

- For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net interest income was $182,799,000, which is $48,663,000 higher than the same quarter of the prior year. Net interest margin was 3.69% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.87% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income is mostly due to rising interest rates. The average rate earned on interest-earning assets grew by 149 basis points to 4.71% while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 86 basis points to 1.31%.
Additionally, average interest-earning assets increased by $1,125,419,000 from the same quarter last year while average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1,056,784,000.
The following table sets forth certain information explaining changes in interest income and interest expense for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 45 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

- Total other expense was $92,278,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $2,665,000 from $89,613,000 for the prior year quarter.

Gain (Loss) on Real Estate Owned
- Results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 include a net loss on REO of $112,000, compared to a net gain of $562,000 for the prior year quarter. The loss during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to normal REO maintenance offset by property sales. Income Tax Expense
- Income tax expense totaled $22,424,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $12,985,000 for the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate was 22.00% and 20.52% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls. 47 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   PART II – Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, none of which the Company believes would have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As previously reported, the Bank was named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that it has been charging customers overdraft fees on items re-presented for payment. In May 2022, the Bank settled the lawsuit for a payment of $495,000 plus claims administrative expenses.
In November 2022, the court issued a final order approving the settlement, and dismissing the case with prejudice which became effective in Dece Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the risk factors discussed below and the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under "Part I--Item 1A--Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause it's actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated
by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Company’s pending merger with Luther Burbank Corporation may expose the Company to certain risks. On November 13, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it intends to acquire Luther Burbank Corporation (“Luther Burbank”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $654 million based upon the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on November 11, 2022. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and it is possible the transaction may not be consummated as planned or at all, and may expose the Company to certain risks, prior to or after completion, including but not limited to: • The Company and Luther Burbank will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions on their respective operations while the merger is pending. • The announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of the Company and Luther Burbank, which could have an adverse effect on their respective business and financial results, and consequently on the combined company if the merger is consummated. • The shareholders of Luther Burbank or the Company may not approve the merger or the related issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock. • Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. • Termination of the merger agreement or failure to complete the merger for whatever reason could adversely impact the Company. • The value of the merger consideration to be issued by the Company is uncertain because the market price of the Company’s Common Stock will fluctuate. • The market price of the Company’s stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those that currently affect the shares of the Company. • Existing holders of Company Common Stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management if the merger is consummated. • Combining Luther Burbank with the Company may prove more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized. • The merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the merger not being completed, which may cause the price of the Company’s stock to decline. • The growth opportunities and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. 48 Table of Contents WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES • Operating costs, customer losses and business disruption following the merger, including adverse effects of relationships with employees, may be greater than expected. • The interest rate environment may change, causing margins to compress and adversely affecting net interest income. • The fair value of the Luther Burbank assets to be acquired in the merger are sensitive to the interest rate environment and may fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, which could reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the merger for the Company.
• The combined company may be unable to retain Washington Federal and/or Luther Burbank personnel.
• The Company may incur substantial costs associated with the merger and the integration of Luther Burbank.
