RASNA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. “Rasna Inc.”
or the “Company”), is a biotechnology company incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 28, 2016. The Company is engaged
in modulating the molecular target LSD1, which is implicated in the disease progression of leukemia and lymphoma.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements are presented in United States dollars (“USD”) which is also the functional currency of the primary economic environment
in which the Company operates.
Risks
and Uncertainties
Management continues to evaluate the impact of
inflation and the economic environment on the Company, and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that inflation could have
a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or ability to secure additional cash resources,
there is no current impact as cash resources are currently secured by existing shareholders. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the
preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently
to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting
policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal
year ended September 30, 2022.
Basis of preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and United
States generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”) for interim reporting.
The principles for condensed interim financial
information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for
complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 and notes thereto included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2023. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), but in the opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, which include
only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s interim financial information.
The results of the operations for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023.
5
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Rasna Research Inc, and Rasna Research Inc’s subsidiary,
Arna Therapeutics Limited. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the fair values of share based awards, income
taxes and contingent liabilities, among others. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that the Company believes to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the Company’s consolidated
financial position and results of operations.
Net loss per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
income per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options, warrants and convertible loan notes, using
various methods such as the treasury stock, modified treasury stock, and if converted methods in the determination of dilutive shares
outstanding during each reporting period.
The shares issuable on the exercise of options
and warrants have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company
has determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows, or do not apply to its operations.
3. LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
The Company has no present revenue and has experienced
net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities since inception.
6
The Company is subject to a number of risks similar
to those of other pre-commercial stage companies, including its dependence on key individuals, uncertainty of product development and
generation of revenues, dependence on outside sources of capital, risks associated with research, development, testing, and obtaining
related regulatory approvals of its pipeline products, suppliers and collaborators, successful protection of intellectual property, competition
with larger, better-capitalized companies, successful completion of the Company’s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment
of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities
and generating a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure.
The Company has experienced net losses and significant
cash outflows from cash used in operating activities and as of December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $ 24,370,911 , a net loss
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $ 149,844
and net cash used in operating activities of $ 1,390 .
The Company expects to continue to incur net losses
and have significant cash outflows for at least the next 12 months and will require significant additional cash resources to
launch new development phases of existing products in its pipeline.
In the event that the Company is unable to secure
the additional cash resources needed, the Company may slow current development phases or halt new development phases in order to mitigate
the effects of the costs of development. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern one year from the date of this filing. This basis of accounting
contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. A successful
transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support the Company’s
cost structure.

7
On December 23, 2022, the Company entered into
a
16 % Convertible Promissory Note with Panetta Partners Ltd. (the “Holder”) pursuant to which the Company issued a Convertible
Promissory Note to the Holder. The Holder provided the Company with $ 30,000
in cash. The Note provides the Holder with the right to convert,
at any time, all or any part of the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into shares of the Company’s common stock
at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) $ 0.001
per share or (ii) the price of the next equity financing, which raises at least
US $ 1,000,000 , subject to adjustments noted within the Agreement. The number of shares issuable upon a conversion shall be determined
by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount of the Note to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price. The
Note requires the Company to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of common stock the amount of shares
that would be issued upon conversion of the Note, which includes the outstanding principal amount of the Note and interest accrued and
to be accrued through the date of maturity.
Embedded Derivative Liability
Under the promissory note agreement, the interest
rate will reset upon the event of a default and an additional penalty of
6 % will be accrued. The Company analyzed the conversion features
of the note agreement for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined the interest rate
resets met the definition of a derivative. It also noted that the Contingent Interest Rate feature required bifurcation from the host
note contract and was to be accounted for at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815-15, the Company bifurcated the Contingent Interest
Rate feature of the note and recorded a derivative liability.
The embedded derivatives for the notes are carried
on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value. During the three months to December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an additional
$ 1,200
due to the issuance of the convertible notes.
Beneficial Conversion Feature
The conversion features for all notes issued are
in the money as of the issuance date and accordingly a beneficial conversion feature was recorded upon issuance. As the intrinsic value
of the beneficial conversion feature exceeds the face value, the recorded beneficial conversion feature was limited to the gross proceeds
less any debt discounts. As at December 31, 2022 this amounted to $ 28,800  for the new notes issued. As at December 31, 2021
the beneficial conversion feature amounted to $ 524,480  for the amended and new notes issued.
5. NOTE PAYABLE
On May 15, 2022, the Company entered into a one-year
Directors and Officers Liability Insurance agreement for $ 89,242 . Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made a down payment of
$ 10,210 , with the remaining balance financed over the remaining term at an annual percentage rate of
7.328 %. Beginning in May 2022, the
Company is making 8 monthly payments of $ 10,210 , with the last payment made in December 2022. At December 31, 2022, the note was fully
paid. The interest expense for the three months ending December 31, 2022 was $ 186 .

Company Background
To date, we have devoted substantially all of
our resources to research and development efforts relating to our therapeutic candidates, including conducting clinical trials and developing
manufacturing capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, protecting our intellectual property and providing general and
administrative support for these operations. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity
securities and convertible notes.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and
as we:
● initiate
new clinical trials;
● seek
to identify, assess, acquire and develop other products, therapeutic candidates and technologies;
● seek
regulatory and marketing approvals in multiple jurisdictions for our therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;
● establish
collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products and therapeutic candidates;
● make
milestone or other payments under our agreements pursuant to which we have licensed or acquired rights to intellectual property and technology;
● seek
to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
● seek
to attract and retain skilled personnel;
● incur
the administrative costs associated with being a public company and related costs of compliance;
● create
additional infrastructure to support our operations as a commercial stage public company and our planned future commercialization efforts;
and
● experience
any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses
and increasing losses for at least the next several years. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in
addition to the net proceeds from this offering in order to obtain regulatory approval for, and the commercialization of our therapeutic
candidates. Until such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities
through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements
and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. If we are unable to obtain
funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development
programs or the commercialization of any approved therapies or products or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize
on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We only have one segment of activity, which is
that of a biotechnology company focused on targeted drugs to treat diseases in oncology and immunology, mainly focusing on the treatment
of leukemia and lymphoma.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, or US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with US GAAP, we base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Basis of preparation
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with US GAAP. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to US GAAP as found in the
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“the FASB”).
Liquidity and Going Concern
We are subject to a number of risks similar to
those of other pre-commercial stage companies, including our dependence on key individuals, uncertainty of product development and generation
of revenues, dependence on outside sources of capital, risks associated with research, development, testing, and obtaining related regulatory
approvals of its pipeline products, suppliers and collaborators, successful protection of intellectual property, competition with larger,
better-capitalized companies, successful completion of our development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations
are dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill our development activities and generating a level of
revenues adequate to support our cost structure.
We have no present revenue and have experienced
net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities since inception, and at December 31, 2022, had a working
capital deficit of $1,714,265.
We
expect to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next twelve months and will require significant
additional cash resources to launch new development phases of existing products in its pipeline. In the event that the Company is unable
to secure the necessary additional cash resources needed, we may slow current development phases or halt new development phases in order
to mitigate the effects of the costs of development. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern one year from the date of this filing. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern one year from the date of this filing. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery
of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. A successful transition to attaining profitable operations
is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support our cost structure.
The
Company is currently looking into raising funds to progress its R&D pipeline.

Revenues
There were no revenues for the three
months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 because the Company does not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products.
Operating Income/(Expenses)
Operating expenses, consisting of research and
development costs, consultancy fees, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses, for the three months ended December
31, 2022 increased to $122,812 from of $81,791 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $41,021.
Other expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
other expense decreased to $27,032 from $192,840 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is predominantly due to less
accretion of debt discount charges and less gain on the adjustment of a derivative liability incurred in the three months ended December
31, 2022 as most notes had been converted.
12
Net loss
Net loss for the three months ended December
31, 2022 decreased to $149,844 from a net loss of $274,631 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a
change of $124,787. This is predominantly due to less accretion of debt discount charges and less gain on the adjustment of
a derivative liability incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as most notes had been converted.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe we will require significant additional
cash resources to continue to launch new development phases of existing products in the Company’s pipeline. In the event that
we are unable to secure the necessary additional cash resources needed, we may slow current development phases or halt new development
phases in order to mitigate the effects of the costs of development. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. A successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level
of positive cash flows adequate to support our cost structure. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience
significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may (i) involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct, delay,
scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates; (ii) seek collaborators for
product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be
available; or (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise
seek to develop or commercialize its self on unfavorable terms.
On December 23, 2022, the Company entered
into a 16% Convertible Promissory Note again with Panetta Partners Ltd. (the “Holder”) pursuant to which the Company issued
a Convertible Promissory Note to the Holder. The Holder provided the Company with $30,000 in cash under the same terms as the fifteenth
note.

ITEM
3. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,”
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time
periods. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design
of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
As of the end of the period covered by this Report,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures,”
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation,  the Chief Executive officer
concluded that, as of the date of the evaluation, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company’s periodic filings under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
