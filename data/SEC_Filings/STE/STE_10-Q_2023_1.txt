Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies STERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention.
WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal (“GI”) endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integrati on. We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences, and Dental. We describe our business segments in Note 9 titled "Business Segment Information." Our fiscal year ends on March 31. References in this Quarterly Report to a particular “year” or “year-end” mean our fiscal year. The significant accounting policies applied in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are summarized below: Interim Financial Statements We prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. This means that they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments (including normal recurring accruals and adjustments) management believes are necessary to fairly state our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 31, 2022. The Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Principles of Consolidation We use the consolidation method to report our investment in our subsidiaries. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. We eliminate inter-company accounts and transactions when we consolidate these accounts. Investments in equity of unconsolidated affiliates, over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating polices, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These investments are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Use of Estimates We make certain estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements according to U.S. GAAP that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to many factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond our control. Actual results could be materially different from these estimates. We revise the estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. This means that operating results for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future quarters or for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Revenue Recognition and Associated Liabilities Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services have transferred to the Customer. Revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services.
Product revenue is recognized when control passes to the Customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms.
Service revenue is recognized when the Customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the Customer. Our Customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. Our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and
9 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale.
Our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are included in Product revenues.
The associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of revenues. Revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from Customers. We have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded.
The reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
Estimated returns are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the Customer. We allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately. Payment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered.
Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant.
We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year. We do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less. Certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At December 31, 2022, assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 9 titled, "Business Segment Information" for disaggregation of revenue. Product Revenue Product revenues consist of revenues generated from sales of consumables and capital equipment. These contracts are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and may include a Distributor, Dealer or Group Purchasing Organization ("GPO") agreement.
We recognize revenue for sales of product when control passes to the Customer, which generally occurs either when the products are shipped or when they are received by the Customer.
Revenue related to capital equipment products is deferred until installation is complete if the capital equipment and installation are highly integrated and form a single performance obligation. Service Revenue Within our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, service revenues include revenue generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair and installation of capital equipment.
These contracts are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and may include a Distributor, Dealer, or Group Purchasing Organization ("GPO") agreement. For maintenance, repair and installation of capital equipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of the service. Healthcare service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument repairs. Contracts for outsourced reprocessing services are primarily based on an agreement with a Customer, ranging in length from several months to 15 years. Outsourced reprocessing services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term using a time-based input measure, adjusted for volume and other performance metrics, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
Contracts for instrument repairs are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order, and the associated revenue is recognized upon completion of the repair.
We also offer preventive maintenance and separately priced extended warranty agreements to our Customers, which require us to maintain and repair our products over the duration of the contract.
Generally, these contract terms are cancellable without penalty and range from one to five years. Amounts received under these Customer contracts are initially recorded as a service liability and are recognized as service revenue ratably over the contract term using a time-based input measure.
Within our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment, service revenues include contract sterilization and laboratory services.
Sales contracts for contract sterilization and laboratory services are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and associated Customer agreement and revenues are generally recognized upon completion of the service. 10 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) Contract Liabilities Payments received from Customers are based on invoices or billing schedules as established in contracts with Customers.
Deferred revenue is recorded when payment is received in advance of performance under the contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of the performance obligation, which generally occurs within one year. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, $ 76,861
of the March 31, 2022 deferred revenue balance was recorded as revenue. During the first nine months of fiscal 2022, $ 42,942
of the March 31, 2021 deferred revenue balance was recorded as revenue. Refer to Note 6 titled, "Additional Consolidated Balance Sheet Information" for deferred revenue balances. Service Liabilities Payments received in advance of performance for cancellable preventive maintenance and separately priced extended warranty contracts are recorded as service liabilities. Service liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance is rendered under the contract.
Refer to Note 6 titled, "Additional Consolidated Balance Sheet Information" for service liability balances. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations reflect only the performance obligations related to agreements for which we have a firm commitment from a Customer to purchase and exclude variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance obligations.
With regard to products, these remaining performance obligations include capital equipment and consumable orders which have not shipped.
With
regard to service, these remaining performance obligations primarily include installation, certification, and outsourced reprocessing services.
As of December 31, 2022, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $ 1,592,000 . We expect to recognize approximately
63 % of the transaction price within one year and approximately
29 % beyond one year. The remainder has yet to be scheduled for delivery .
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Impacting the Company Recently Issued Accounting Standards Impacting the Company are presented in the following table: Standard Date of Issuance Description Date of Adoption Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters Standards that have been adopted in fiscal 2023 ASU 2021-08 "Business Combinations (Topic 805) Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers." October 2021 The standard provides guidance to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with Customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer.
First Quarter Fiscal 2023 We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2022 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. A detailed description of our significant and critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions is included in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022.

Business Acquisitions
During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Applied Sterilization Technologies and Healthcare segments. Total aggregate consideration was approximately $ 40,720 , including potential contingent consideration of $ 6,700 . On June 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in Cantel Medical LLC ("Cantel") through a U.S. subsidiary.
The total consideration for Cantel common stock and s tock equivalents was $ 3,599,471 .
We funded the cash portion of the transaction consideration and repayment of a significant amount of Cantel’s existing debt obligations with a portion of the proceeds from new debt, which is described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022,
which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. In addition to the total purchase consideration, STERIS assumed and repaid
$ 721,284
of existing Cantel debt obligations and assumed Cantel's obligations associated with convertible senior notes issued on May 15, 2020, which is described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022.

Income Tax Expense
The effective income tax rates for the three month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
23.1 % and
21.6 %, respectively. The higher fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is the result of changes in geographic mix and favorable discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The effective income tax rates for the nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were ( 114.8 )% and
21.5 %, respectively.
The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate for the
nine
month period ended December 31, 2022
decreased
when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the tax impact of the goodwill impairment loss recognized on the Dental segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Income tax expense is provided on an interim basis based upon our estimate of the annual effective income tax rate, adjusted each quarter for discrete items. In determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate, we analyze various factors, including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives. We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various United States federal, state and local, as well as foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations for years before fiscal
15 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) 2018 and, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to United States state and local, or non-United States, income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2016. We remain subject to tax authority audits in various jurisdictions wherever we do business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed an appeals process with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding proposed audit adjustments related to deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. An agreement was reached on final interest rates, which also impacts subsequent years through 2020. We estimate the total federal, state, and local tax impact of the settlement to be approximately $ 12,000
for the fiscal years 2016 through 2020, of which approximately $ 7,500
has been paid through December 31, 2022.
In May 2021, we received two notices of proposed tax adjustment from the IRS regarding deemed dividend inclusions and associated withholding tax. The notices relate to the fiscal and calendar year 2018. The IRS adjustments would result in a cumulative tax liability of approximately $ 50,000 . We are contesting the IRS’s assertions. We have not established reserves related to these notices. An unfavorable outcome is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position but could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period. 8.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief. We believe we have adequately reserved for our current litigation and claims that are probable and estimable, and further believe that the ultimate outcome of these pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. Due to their inherent uncertainty, however, there can be no assurance of the ultimate outcome or effect of current or future litigation, investigations, claims or other proceedings (including without limitation the matters discussed below). For certain types of claims, we presently maintain insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage and other liability coverages in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are prudent, but there can be no assurance that these coverages will be applicable or adequate to cover adverse outcomes of claims or legal proceedings against us. Civil, criminal, regulatory or other proceedings involving our products or services could possibly result in judgments, settlements or administrative or judicial decrees requiring us, among other actions, to pay damages or fines or effect recalls, or be subject to other governmental, Customer or other third party claims or remedies, which could materially effect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information regarding these matters, see the following portions of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022, Item 1 titled "Business - Information with respect to our Business in General - Government Regulation" and the "Risk Factors" in Item 1A titled "Product and service related regulations and claims." From time to time, STERIS is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving contract, patent protection, and other claims asserted by us. Gains, if any, from these proceedings are recognized when they are realized. We are subject to taxation from United States federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual jurisdiction or the closing of statutes of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. We describe income taxes further in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Income Tax Expense” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 16 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) 9.
Business Segment Information We report our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences and Dental.
Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. Our Healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. Our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. In addition, our procedural solutions also include single-use devices and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas. Our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment is a third-party service provider for contract sterilization, as well as testing services needed to validate sterility services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our technology-neutral offering supports Customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization. Our Life Sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services that support pharmaceutical manufacturing, primarily for vaccine and other biopharma Customers focused on aseptic manufacturing. These solutions include a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance and specialty services, and capital equipment.
Our Dental segment provides a comprehensive offering for dental practitioners and dental schools, offering instruments, infection prevention consumables and instrument management systems. We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. Certain prior period costs were reallocated from the Healthcare segment to Corporate to conform with current year presentation. The prior period segment operating income measure has been recast for comparability.
For the three and nine months e nded
December 31, 2022 ,
revenues from a single Customer did not represent ten percent or more of the Healthcare, AST or Life Sciences segment revenues.
Three Customers collectively and consistently account for more than 40.0% of our Dental segment revenue. The percentage associated with these three Customers collectively in any one period may vary due to the buying patterns of these three Customers as well as other Dental Customers. These three Customers collectively accounted for appr oxi mately
47.2 % and
43.8 % o f our Dental segment revenues for the
three
and

Shares and Preferred Shares Ordinary shares We calculate basic earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding. We calculate diluted earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share equivalents calculated using the treasury stock method.

Options to purchase the following number of shares were outstanding but excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the combined exercise prices, unamortized fair values, and assumed tax benefits upon exercise were greater than the average market price for the shares during the periods, so including these options would be anti-dilutive: 19 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted)   Three Months Ended December 31,

Repurchases of Ordinary Shares
On May 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program resulting in a share repurchase authorization of approximately $ 78,979
(net of taxes, fees and commissions). On July 30, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the May 7, 2019 authorization of an additional amount of
$ 300,000
(net of taxes, fees and commissions).
As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 160,626
(net of taxes, fees and commissions) of remaining availability under the Board authorized share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no specified expiration date.
Under the authorization, the Company may repurchase its shares from time to time through open market purchases, including 10b5-1 plans. Any share repurchases may be activated, suspended or discontinued at any time. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, share repurchases were suspended on April 9, 2020.
The suspension was lifted effective February 10, 2022, enabling the Company to resume stock repurchases pursuant to the prior authorizations.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased
775,320
of our ordinary shares for the aggregate amount of $ 148,306
(net of fees and commissions) pursuant to the authorizations.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we obtained
74,897
of our ordinary shares in the aggregate amount of $ 13,060
in connection with share-based compensation award programs. During the first nine months of fiscal 2022, we obtained
225,493
of our ordinary shares in the aggregate amount of
$ 27,628
in connection with share-based compensation award programs.

Share-Based Compensation We maintain a long-term ince ntive plan that makes available shares for grants, at the discretion of the Board of Directors or
the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors, to officers, directors, and key employees in the form of stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights and share grants. We satisfy share award incentives through the issuance of new ordinary shares.
Stock options provide the right to purchase our shares at the market price on the date of grant, or for options granted to employees in fiscal 2019 and thereafter, 110% of the market price on the date of grant, subject to the terms of the plan and agreements. Generally, one-fourth of the stock options granted to employees become exercisable for each full year of employment following the grant date. Stock options granted generally expire 10 years after the grant date, or in some cases earlier if the option holder is no longer employed by us. Restricted shares and restricted share units generally cliff vest after a four year period or vest in tranches of one-fourth of the number granted for each year of employment after the grant date.
As of December 31, 2022,
2,798,121
ordinary shares remained available for grant under the long-term incentive plan.
The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at their grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics that are not present in our option grants. If the model permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options, the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options could be different. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The expense is classified as cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses in a manner consistent with the employee’s compensation and benefits. 20 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) The following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022:   Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Risk-free interest rate 2.44   % 1.10   % Expected life of options 5.9
years 5.9
years Expected dividend yield of stock 0.80   % 0.95   % Expected volatility of stock 24.49   % 24.27   % The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The expected life of options is reflective of historical experience, vesting schedules and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield of stock represents our best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. The expected volatility of stock is derived by referring to our historical stock prices over a time frame similar to that of the expected life of the grant. An estimated forfeiture rate of
2.54 % and
2.85 % was applied in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. This rate is calculated based upon historical activity and represents an estimate of the granted options not expected to vest. If actual forfeitures differ from this calculated rate, we may be required to make additional adjustments to compensation expense in future periods. The assumptions used above are reviewed at the time of each significant option grant, or at least annually. A summary of share option activity is as follows:   Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at March 31, 2022 1,560,954   $ 138.37   Granted 235,435   247.45   Exercised ( 25,228 ) 51.70   Forfeited ( 8,928 ) 205.25   Outstanding at December 31, 2022 1,762,233   $ 153.85   6.4
years $ 77,486   Exercisable at December 31, 2022 1,137,168   $ 121.60   5.4
years $ 74,465   We estimate that
611,629
of the non-vested stock options outstanding at December 31, 2022 will ultimately vest. The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax difference between the $ 184.69
closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2022 over the exercise prices of the stock options, multiplied by the number of options outstanding or outstanding and exercisable, as applicable. The aggregate intrinsic value is not recorded for financial accounting purposes and the value changes daily based on the daily changes in the fair market value of ordinary shares. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $ 4,638
and $ 43,425 , respectively. Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $ 1,497
and $ 6,789
for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.
The weighted average grant date fair value of stock option grants was $ 50.72
and $ 37.52
for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Stock appreciation rights (“SARS”) carry generally the same terms and vesting requirements as stock options except that they are settled in cash upon exercise and therefore, are classified as liabilities. As of May 24, 2021, we no longer have outstanding SARS.

The value of restricted shares and units that vested during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 at the time of grant was $ 20,237 .
As of December 31, 2022, there was a total of $ 72,008
in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation granted under our share-based compensation plan. We expect to recognize the cost over a weighted average period of
2.1
years. Cantel Share Based Compensation Plan
In connection with the acquisition of Cantel, outstanding, non-vested Cantel restricted share units were replaced with STERIS restricted share units. A total of
280,402
STERIS restricted share units replaced Cantel awards based on a ratio of one Cantel restricted share unit to
0.4262
STERIS restricted share units. Cantel time based restricted share units were replaced with STERIS restricted share units with the same three-year pro-rata vesting terms based on the original award date. Performance based Cantel restricted share units were replaced with time based STERIS restricted share units that vest pro rata over the remaining one, two or three anniversaries from the original Cantel award date. The number of Cantel performance restricted share units was replaced based on the original target achievement level. All replacement restricted share units retained dividend accumulation rights.
The fair value of each STERIS restricted share unit awarded on June 2, 2021 to replace outstanding non-vested Cantel restricted share units was $ 191.18
based on the closing price of STERIS ordinary shares on June 2, 2021. Approximately $ 18,173
of the total $ 53,607
grant date fair value was attributable to pre-acquisition services provided and was recorded as a component of purchase consideration in connection with the acquisition of Cantel. Recognition of unamortized share-based compensation expense
totaling
$ 18,545
was accelerated in connection with the planned termination of certain Cantel executive level employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . As a result of the formal notices provided and the terms of the Cantel share based compensati on plans and Cantel Executive Severance and Change of Control Plan, the remaining service required under the awards became non-substantive requiri ng acceleration of the remaining related compensation cost.
As of December 31, 2022, there was a total of $ 2,319
in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested STERIS restricted shar e units awarded to replace Cantel restricted share units. We expect to recognize the cost over a weighted average period of
0.8
years . A summary of the non-vested restricted share units activity associated with the Cantel share-based compensation plans is presented below: Number of Restricted Share Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Non-vested at March 31, 2022 45,722   $ 191.18   Granted —   —   Vested ( 24,775 ) 191.18   Forfeited ( 4,507 ) 191.18   Non-vested at December 31, 2022 16,440   $ 191.18   22 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) 13.
Financial and Other Guarantees We generally offer a limited parts and labor warranty on capital equipment. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending on the product sold and the countries where we conduct business. We record a liability for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenues are recognized. The amounts we expect to incur on behalf of our Customers for the future estimated cost of these warranties are recorded as a current liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Factors that affect the amount of our warranty liability include the number and type of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of product failures, and material and service costs per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Changes in our warranty liability during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Warranties Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 14,108   Warranties issued during the period 8,749   Settlements made during the period ( 9,415 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 13,442   14.
Derivatives and Hedging From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to hedge potential foreign currency gains and losses that arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in nickel that impact raw materials included in our cost of revenues. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we also held forward foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of our expected non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings against our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. These foreign currency exchange contracts will mature during fiscal 2023. We did not elect hedge accounting for these forward foreign currency contracts; however, we may seek to apply hedge accounting in future scenarios. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
None of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in their fair value are not deferred but are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2022, we held foreign currency forward contracts to buy
13.0
million British pounds sterling; and to sell
150.0
million Mexican pesos, and
16.3
million euros. At December 31, 2022, we held commodity swap contracts to buy
200.4
thousand pounds of nickel.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We estimate the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into three tiers. These tiers include Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the entity to develop its own assumptions. The following table shows the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022:     Fair Value Measurements   Carrying Value Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, March 31, December 31, March 31, December 31, March 31, December 31, March 31, Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 259,371   $ 348,320   $ 259,371   $ 348,320   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   Forward and swap contracts

The fair values of forward and swap contracts are based on period-end forward rates and reflect the value of the amount that we would pay or receive for the contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates. (2)
We maintain a frozen domestic non-qualified deferred compensation plan covering certain employees, which allows for the deferral of payment of previously earned compensation for an employee-specified term or until retirement or termination. Amounts deferred can be allocated to various hypothetical investment options (compensation deferrals have been frozen under the plan). We hold investments to satisfy the future obligations of the plan. Employees who made deferrals are entitled to receive distributions of their hypothetical account balances (amounts deferred, together with earnings (losses)). We also hold an investment in the common stock of Servizi Italia, S.p.A, a leading provider of integrated linen washing and outsourced sterile processing services to hospital Customers. Changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in the "Interest and miscellaneous expense (income) line" of the Consolidated Statement of Income.
During the
third
quarter and first
nine
months of fiscal 2023, we recorded gains (losses) of $( 342 ) and $ 1,385 , respectively, related to these investments.
During the
third
quarter and first
nine
months of fiscal 2022, we recorded gains (losses) of $ 28
and $( 200 ), respectively, related to these investments. (3)
We estimate the fair value of our debt using discounted cash flow analyses, based on estimated current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangement s. (4)
Contingent consideration obligations arise from business acquisitions. The fair values are based on discounted cash flow analyses reflecting the possible achievement of specified performance measures or events and capture the contractual nature of the contingencies, commercial risk, and the time value of money. Contingent consideration obligations are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as accrued expense (short-term) and other liabilities (long-term), as appropriate based on the contractual payment dates . 24 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) The changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows: Contingent Consideration Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 10,550   Additions 7,450   Payments ( 60 ) Reductions ( 3,100 ) Currency translation adjustments ( 20 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 14,820   25 Table of Contents STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)—(Continued) For the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except as noted) 16.

Goodwill Changes to the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: Healthcare Segment Life Sciences Segment Applied Sterilization Technologies Segment Dental Segment Total Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 2,326,830   $ 179,288   $ 1,432,858   $ 465,367   $ 4,404,343   Goodwill acquired 10,753   —   —   —   10,753   Measurement period adjustments to acquired goodwill ( 21,624 ) 3,147   —   40,565   22,088   Impairment —   —   —   ( 490,565 ) ( 490,565 ) Divestiture ( 2,358 ) —   —   —   ( 2,358 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments ( 18,157 ) ( 1,073 ) ( 56,655 ) ( 15,367 ) ( 91,252 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 2,295,444   $ 181,362   $ 1,376,203   $ —   $ 3,853,009   We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually at the reporting unit level during the third fiscal quarter, or when indicators of potential impairment exist.
The Company's reporting units are equivalent to the reportable operating segments. In connection with the preparation of our second quarter consolidated financial statements, we considered the risk of impairment due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions including rising interest rates and inflationary pressures on material and labor costs, as well as uncertainty regarding the impact such economic strains will have on patient and Customer behavior in the short-term. Our conclusion, based on the qualitative assessment of these factors, was that it was more likely than not that the goodwill allocated to the Dental segment as of September 30, 2022 was impaired.
Our quantitative analysis to measure the extent of goodwill impairment compared the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the Dental segment. The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows. Future cash flow projections are consistent with those used in our forecasting and strategic planning processes. The determination of the discount rate requires judgement and assumptions to be developed about the weighted average cost of capital that market participants would employ in evaluating the current fair value of the business. The macroeconomic factors that triggered the interim review are also the drivers of the increase in the weighted average cost of capital assumption.
In connection with the preparation of our second quarter consolidated financial statements, we identified and recognized, as of September 30, 2022, that the estimated fair value of the Dental segment was below the carrying value resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $ 490,565 . The impairment charge was recorded within “Goodwill impairment loss” in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three-month period ended September 30, 2022.
Our review as of September 30, 2022 did not indicate that impairment of goodwill was more likely than not for any of the remaining segments during the period. The annual goodwill impairment review was conducted in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as planned.
No additional goodwill impairment was identified during this review. 27 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of STERIS plc
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of STERIS plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedule (not presented herein); and in our report dated May 31, 2022, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

shares, cash dividends and future working capital needs. As you read the MD&A, it may be helpful to refer to information in our consolidated financial statements contained herein, which present the results of our operations for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. It may also be helpful to refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 31, 2022, including information in Item 1, "Business," Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies," and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 8, 2022, for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations.
In the MD&A, we analyze and explain the period-over-period changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This information, discussion, and analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS. Financial Measures In the following sections of the MD&A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows: • Backlog
– We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements. • Debt-to-total capital
– We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth. • Days sales outstanding (“DSO”)
– We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect. We, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD&A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Revenues – Defined As required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues: • Revenues
– Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances. • Product Revenues
– We define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products. 29 Table of Contents • Service Revenues
– We define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services, instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment. • Capital Equipment Revenues
– We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes: steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated operating room ("OR"). • Consumable Revenues
– We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables including V-PRO, SYSTEM 1 and 1E consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, cleaning consumables, and surgical instruments.
• Recurring Revenues
– We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues. General Company Overview and Executive Summary
STERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention.
WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences
and dental products and services. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal (“GI”) endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as OR integrati on. We operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences and Dental.
Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We describe our business segments in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Business Segment Information." The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. Acquisitions . During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Applied Sterilization Technologies and Healthcare segments. Total aggregate consideration was approximately $40.7 million, including potential contingent consideration of $6.7 million. On June 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in Cantel Medical LLC. ("Cantel") .
Cantel’s Dental business extended our business into a new Customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes. This business is being reported as the Dental segment. The rest of
Cantel was integrated into our existing Healthcare and Life Sciences segments. Additionally, the acquisition has and is expected to continue to result in cost savings from optimizing global back-office infrastructure, leveraging best-demonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs. The results of Cantel are reflected in the results of operations and cash flows from June 2, 2021 forward, which will affect comparability to the prior period results of operations and cash flows. Acquisition and integration expenses totaled $4.8 million and $18.5 million for the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 , respectively.
Acquisition and integration expenses totaled $9.3 million and $167.7 million for the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 , respectively. These costs were primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Cantel. Acquisition and integration expenses are reported in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, we identified and recognized a Goodwill impairment loss of $490.6 million related to goodwill that arose with respect to assets acquired in the Cantel acquisition. 30 Table of Contents COVID-19 Pandemic and Macroeconomic Environment .
The COVID-19 global pandemic and its direct and indirect impacts have led to disruptions in the market and the global and U.S. economies that may continue for a prolonged period. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous containment measures, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A number of our global suppliers, vendors, and distributors are located in regions that have been adversely affected by restrictive government and private enterprise measures implemented in response to the pandemic, or have otherwise been disrupted by associated prevailing macroeconomic trends. This has led to product and labor shortages, shipping delays and an increase in raw material and component pricing as well as other inflationary pressures, particularly on our manufacturing costs.
Throughout the pandemic, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services. To date, we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our Customers. Nonetheless, in fiscal 2023, supply chain disruptions and delays have limited and may continue to limit our ability to ship certain capital equipment, particularly in our Healthcare and Life Sciences business, negatively impacting capital equipment revenue growth. Within the Healthcare and Life Sciences businesses, approximately $46 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
We continue to pursue all available avenues to address supply chain disruptions, including purchases from third parties and brokers, qualifying alternative parts and suppliers, and obtaining prioritization from governmental agencies. W e do not
believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations. For additional information and our risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022, and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 8, 2022.
Highlights.
Revenues increased 0.6% to $1,216.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $1,209.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Revenues increased 5.9% to $3,573.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $3,374.4 million for the same period in the prior year. These increases reflect growth in the Healthcare and Applied Sterilization Technologies segments, offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies and divestiture activity. Gross profit percentage for the
third
quarter of fiscal 2023 was 42.9% compared to the gross profit percentage for the
third
quarter of fiscal 2022 of 44.5%.
Gross profit percentage for the first
nine
months of fiscal 2023 was 44.0% compared to the gross profit percentage for the first
nine months
of fiscal 2022 of 42.8%. Unfavorable impacts from inflation and other adjustments were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing and divestitures for the
third quarter of fiscal
2023. Favorable impacts from mix, pricing, and divestitures were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from inflation and productivity for the first
nine
months of fiscal 2023. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $190.8 million, compared to operating income of $202.9 million for third quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was $42.8 million, compared to operating income of $333.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. In the fiscal 2022 periods, we incurred additional acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of Cantel. The fiscal 2023 reduction in such operating expenses was more than offset by a one time goodwill impairment charge of $490.6 million as well as an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Cash flows from operations were $541.1 million and free cash flow was $262.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to cash flows from operations of $513.1 million and free cash flow of $300.3 million for first nine months of fiscal 2022 (see the subsection below titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). The fiscal 2023 increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to lower costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel in the fiscal 2023 period. The fiscal 2023 decrease in free cash flows was primarily due to higher working capital, particularly inventory and increased capital spending. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 33.6% at December 31, 2022 and 32.1% at March 31, 2022. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling $1.37 per ordinary share. Additional information regarding our financial performance during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 is included in the subsection below titled “Results of Operations.”
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 31 Table of Contents These non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares.

third quarter of fiscal 2022 of 44.5%. Unfavorable impacts from inflation (250 basis points), volume (30 basis points), productivity (30 basis points), and other adjustments (100 basis points), were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing (150 basis points), divestitures (70 basis points), and fluctuations in currency (30 basis points).
Gross profit percentage for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was 44.0% compared to the gross profit percentage for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 of 42.8%. Favorable impacts from pricing (150 basis points), acquisition and divestiture activity (70 basis points), fluctuations in currency (20 basis points), and mix and other adjustments (310 basis points), were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from inflation (350 basis points), productivity (60 basis points), and volume (20 basis points). The gross profit percentage reported for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by the step up to fair value of the inventory held by Cantel at the time of acquisition which is reflected in the improvement identified as mix and other adjustments above.

Significant components of total Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment expenses, facilities costs, and other general and administrative expenses. SG&A decreased 1.7% and 8.2% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, over the same prior year periods. In the fiscal 2022 periods, we incurred additional acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of Cantel. The fiscal 2023 reduction in such expenses was partially offset by an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets in the fiscal 2023 periods. Goodwill Impairment Loss.
A Goodwill impairment loss of $490.6 million was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as the result of an interim assessment of the fair value of the Dental segment.
For more information regarding our goodwill impairment loss, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Goodwill." Research and Development.
Resea rch and development expenses increased 2.8% and 21.6% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, over the same prior year periods. The double digit increase in the nine month period was primarily due to the addition of Cantel. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. During fiscal 2023, our investments in research and development have continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. Non-Operating Expenses, Net.
Non-operating expenses, net consists of interest expense on debt, offset by interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, and other miscellaneous income.

The effective income tax rates for the three month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 23.1% and 21.6%, respective ly.
The higher fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is the result of changes in geographic mix and favorable discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The effective income tax rates for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (114.8)% and 21.5%, respectively.
The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the tax impact of the goodwill impairment loss recognized on the Dental segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Business Segment Results of Operations.
We report our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences and Dental.
Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. Our Healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. Our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. In addition, our procedural solutions also include single-use devices and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas. Our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment is a third-party service provider for contract sterilization, as well as testing services needed to validate sterility services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our technology-neutral offering supports Customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization. Our Life Sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services that support pharmaceutical manufacturing, primarily for vaccine and other biopharma Customers focused on aseptic manufacturing. These solutions include a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance and specialty services, and capital equipment.

Healthcare revenues increased 1.2% to $769.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $759.7 million for the same prior year period. This increase reflects growth in capital equipment and service revenues of 4.6%
and 5.0% respectively, which was partially offset by a 5.1% decline in consumable revenues, and reflects improvements in volume and pricing, which were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of divestiture activity and fluctuations in currencies.
Healthcare revenues increased 4.5% to $2,200.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $2,106.6 million for the same prior year period. This increase reflects growth in capital equipment, service and consumable revenues of 8.5%, 4.9% and 1.0%, respectively, and reflects the favorable impact of the Cantel acquisition and increased demand, partially offset by divestiture activity and unfavorable fluctuations in currencies. The Healthcare segment’s backlog at December 31, 2022, was $540.4 million. Excluding Cantel, the Healthcare segment's backlog at December 31, 2021 was $381.6 million.
In addition to the added volume from Cantel, the increase is primarily due to built up demand and supply chain disruptions.
38 Table of Contents AST revenues increased 2.6% to $222.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $216.3 million for the same prior year period. AST revenues increased 7.2% to $675.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $630.1 million for the same prior year period.
The fiscal 2023 increases are primarily due to increases in volume and pricing, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.
Life Sciences revenues decreased 5.2% to $121.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $127.9 million for the same prior year period. This decrease reflects declines in capital equipment and consumable revenues of 6.0% and 9.0%, respectively, which were partially offset by a 1.9% increase in service revenues. The decline was driven by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies, divestiture activity, and volume declines, which exceeded favorable impacts from pricing.
Life Sciences revenues decreased 0.6% to $379.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $381.7 million for the same prior year period. This decrease is the result of a decline in consumable revenues of 3.8%, which was partially offset by growth in capital equipment and service revenues of 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively.
The decrease was driven by the negative impacts of currency fluctuations and divestiture activity, which exceeded favorable impacts from pricing.
The Life Sciences segme nt’s backlog at
December 31, 2022 amounted to $110.6 million, representing a decrease of 5.6% as compared to the backlog of $117.2 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a slowdown in demand when compared to the same period in the prior year. Dental segment revenues for the
three
months ended December 31, 2022
decreased
to
$103.6 million from $105.1 million for the same prior year period.
The decline was the result of lower volume and unfavorable currency fluctuations, which exceeded the favorable impact of pricing.
Dental segment revenues for the
nine
months ended December 31, 2022
increased
to
$318.0 million from $256.0 million for the same prior year period.
The increase was driven by the timing of the Cantel acquisition. The Healthcare segment’s operating income decreased 0.2% to $175.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $175.8 million in the same prior year period. The segment's operating margins were 22.8% and 23.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The decreases in operating income and margin were primarily due to unfavorable impacts from supply chain, inflation, and divestiture activity, which exceeded the benefits of higher volume and pricing. The Healthcare segment’s operating income increased
3.1% to $497.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $482.5 million in the same prior year period,
primarily due to higher volume and the Cantel acquisition. The se gment's operating margins were 22.6% and 22.9% for the first
nine
months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The decline in operating margin is primarily due to increased supply chain and inflationary costs, and higher research and development expenses in fiscal 2023.
The AST segment's operating income increased 2.2% to $103.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $101.3 million during the same prior year period. The AST segment's operating income increased 6.7% to $323.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $303.1 million during the same prior year period. The segment's operating margins were 46.6% and 46.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The segment's operating margins were 47.9% and 48.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively . The increase in segment operating income and decrease in operating margin were primarily due to increased volume, which was partially offset by higher labor and energy costs in fiscal 2023.
The Life Sciences segment’s operating income decreased 13.0% to $45.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $52.0 million for the same prior year period.
The Life Sciences segment’s operating income decreased 6.0% to $149.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $158.6 million for the same prior year period. The segment's operating margins were 37.3% and 40.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The segment's operating margins were 39.3% and 41.6% for the first
nine months
of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The decreases in segment operating income and operating margin were primarily due to a reduction in volume as well as supply chain and inflationary cost increases. The Dental segment's operating income decreased 11.9% to $20.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $23.1 million for the same prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in volume. The Dental segment's operating income increased 3.6% to $68.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $65.6 million, for the same prior year period.
The segment's operating margins were 19.6% and 22.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The segment's operating margins were 21.4% and 25.6% for the first
nine
months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Dental segment's fiscal
2023 operating income and margins have been negatively impacted by the reduction in volume, decreased manufacturing productivity, and increased supply chain and inflationary costs. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes significant components of our cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:   Nine Months Ended December 31,

Cash
Requirements.
We intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations for short-term and long-term capital expenditures and our other liquidity needs.

To th e extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. There can be no
41 Table of Contents assurance that our existing financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information
STERIS plc ("Parent") and its wholly-owned subsid iaries,
STERIS Limited and STERIS Corporation (collectively "Guarantors" and each a "Guarantor"), each have provided guarantees of the obligations of STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company ("FinCo", "STERIS Irish FinCo"), a wholly-owned subsidiary issuer, under Senior Public Notes issued by STERIS Irish FinCo on April 1, 2021 and of certain other obligations relating to the Senior Public Notes. The Senior Public Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. The Senior Public Notes and the related guarantees
are senior unsecured obligations of STERIS Irish FinCo and the Guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the
Private Placement Senior Notes, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan.
All of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of STERIS, other than STERIS Irish FinCo, STERIS Limited and STERIS Corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the Senior Public Notes.
STERIS Irish FinCo’s main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of STERIS plc and its subsidiaries.
The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the Issuer and ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to service the Senior Public Notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.
The following is a summary of the Senior Public Notes guarantees: Guarantees of Senior Notes • Parent Company Guarantor – STERIS plc • Subsidiary Issuer – STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company • Subsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Limited • Subsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Corporation The guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged: • in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; • in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; • in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances); • upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Senior Public Notes or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture; • as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or • in the case of the Parent, if the Issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any Material Credit Facility of the Issuer terminate upon the Issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Parent; and • upon such Guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with. The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Information related to our critical accounting estimates and assumptions is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions have not changed materially from March 31, 2022. Contingencies
We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal
43 Table of Contents injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. We record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information. We are subject to taxation from United States federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The IRS routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns. Refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Income Tax Expense" for more information.
Forward-Looking Statements

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to interest rate, currency, and commodity risks. Information related to these risks and our management of these exposures is included in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. Our exposures to market risks have not changed materially since March 31, 2022. Fluctuations in currency rates could affect our revenues, cost of revenues and income from operations and could result in currency exchange gains and losses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into forward currency contracts in order to hedge a portion of our expected euro-denominated earnings against our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. These currency exchange contracts will mature during fiscal 2023. We did not elect hedge accounting for these forward currency contracts; however, we may seek to apply hedge accounting in future scenarios. As a result, we may experience volatility due to (i) the timing mismatch of unrealized hedge gains or losses versus recognition of the underlying hedged earnings, and (ii) the impact of unrealized and realized hedge gains or losses being reported in selling, general and administrative expenses, whereas the offsetting economic gains and losses of the underlying hedged earnings are reported in the various line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2022, we held foreign currency forward contracts to buy
13.0
million British pounds sterling; and to sell
150.0
million Mexican pesos, and to sell
16.3
million euros. We are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. The costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our cost of revenues. At December 31, 2022, we held commodity swap contracts to buy
200.4
thousand
pounds of nickel. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Principal Financial Officer (“PFO”), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, including the assessment and input of our management, the PEO and PFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 46 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Information regarding our legal proceedings is included in this Form 10-Q in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" and in Item 7 of Part II, titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
For a complete discussion of the Company's risk factors, you should carefully review the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 8, 2022. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On May 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program resulting in a share repurchase authorization of approximately $79.0 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions). On July 30, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the May 7, 2019 authorization of an additional amount of $300.0 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions).
As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $160.6 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions) of remaining availability under the Board authorized share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no specified expiration date.
Under the authorization, the Company may repurchase its shares from time to time through open market purchases, including 10b5-1 plans. Any share repurchases may be activated, suspended or discontinued at any time. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, share repurchases were suspended on April 9, 2020.
The suspension was lifted effective February 10, 2022, enabling the Company to resume stock repurchases pursuant to the prior authorizations . During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we obtained 74,897 of our ordinary shares in the aggregate amount of $13.1 million in connection with share based compensation award programs.
