Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options
In
August 2020,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)  2020 - 06,   Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic   470 - 20 )  and  Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity ’ s Own Equity (Subtopic   815 -   40 )  (“ASU  2020 - 06 ”). The ASU  2020 - 06  simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and application of the equity classification guidance and made certain disclosure amendments. In addition, this ASU also amends certain aspects of the earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance. ASU  2020 - 06  is effective for financial reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2021 ,  except smaller reporting companies for which this ASU is effective for financial reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2023 .  Early adoption is permitted, and an entity should adopt this ASU as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company elected to early adopt ASU  2020 - 06  as of the  first  day of the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2023 ,  using the modified retrospective approach which allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or accumulated deficit in the period of adoption. The adoption of ASU
2020 - 06
did
not
have any impact on the accumulated deficit or any other components of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
October 1, 2022
nor did it have a material impact on earnings per share for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022.
Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption
Financial Instruments
–
Credit Losses
In
June 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2016 - 13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326 ) , which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU
2016 - 13
is effective for smaller reporting companies for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2022,
including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Business Combinations
In
October 2021,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2021 - 08,
Business Combinations (Topic
606 ): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic
606
as if it had originated the contracts. Generally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree’s financial statements, if the acquiree prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The guidance should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendment in this update. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
All other Accounting Standards Updates issued but
not
yet effective are
not
expected to have a material effect on the Company’s future consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

4.     Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of accounts receivable, accounts payable, warrant liabilities, contingent consideration and long-term debt arrangements. The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, under U.S. GAAP, companies are required to provide disclosure and categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into
one
of
three
different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e., inputs) used in the valuation. Level  1
provides the most reliable measure of fair value while Level  3
generally requires significant management judgment. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows:
Level  1—Valuations
are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level  2—Valuations
are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices in markets that are
not
active for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level  3—Valuations
are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The carrying value of the Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. As of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022,
the aggregate fair values of long-term debts were each $ 0.9  million, with an aggregate carrying value of $ 1.1
million. The fair value is based on interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the debt would be classified as Level
2
in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings during the period. The fair value of the Company’s warrant liabilities are valued utilizing Level
3
inputs. Warrant liabilities are valued using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model, which takes into consideration the volatilities of comparable public companies, due to the relatively low trading volume of the Company’s common stock. The Monte Carlo option-pricing model uses certain assumptions, including expected life and annual volatility. The range and weighted average volatilities of comparable public companies utilized was
28.0 % -
65.1 % and
54.8 %, respectively, as of
December 31, 2022,
and
26.6 % -
64.3 % and
55.3 %, respectively, as of
September 30, 2022.
The volatility utilized in the Monte Carlo option-pricing model was determined by weighing
60 % to the Company-specific volatility and
40 % on comparable public companies. The significant inputs and assumptions utilized were as follows:

The Company recognized gains of $ 297
and $ 2,441
for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively, related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. The changes in fair value of warrant liabilities were due to changes in inputs, primarily a change in the stock price, to the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The Company’s contingent consideration obligations are from arrangements resulting from acquisitions completed in prior periods
not
presented that involve potential future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of revenue targets and operational goals. Contingent consideration is recognized at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition based on the Company’s expected probability of future payment, discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies.
The Company reviews and re-assesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at each reporting period and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. The Company measures contingent consideration recognized in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified as Level
3
inputs. The Company uses a simulation-based model to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration on the acquisition date and at each reporting period. The simulation model uses certain inputs and assumptions, including revenue projections, an estimate of revenue discount and volatility rate based on comparable public companies’ data, and risk-free rate. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability limited to the contractual maximum of the contingent consideration liabilities. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate on the acquisition date and each reporting period and the amount paid will be recognized in earnings.
Assets and liabilities of the Company measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2022

Summary of Option and Warrant Activity and Outstanding Shares
During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022,
the Company granted options to purchase
50,000  shares at an exercise price of $ 1.34 , which vest ratably over a
three -year period. During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2021,
the Company granted options to purchase
5,000  shares at an exercise price of $ 4.11 , which vest ratably over a
three -year period commencing on
October 1, 2021.
The weighted-average option fair values, as determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, and the assumptions used to estimate these values for stock options granted during the periods ended are as follows:

The expected option term is the number of years the Company estimates the options will be outstanding prior to exercise based on historical trends of employee turnover. Expected volatility is based on historical daily price changes of the Company’s common stock for a period equal to the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is
zero
since the Company does
not
currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does
not
anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants using the “treasury stock” method and convertible preferred stock using the “as-if-converted” method. The computation of diluted earnings per share does
not
include the effect of outstanding stock options, warrants and convertible preferred stock that are considered anti-dilutive.
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is computed as follows:

footnote (Note

The Company frequently warrants that the technology solutions it develops for its clients will operate in accordance with the project specifications without defects for a specified warranty period, subject to certain limitations that the Company believes are standard in the industry. In the event that defects are discovered during the warranty period, and
none
of the limitations apply, the Company is obligated to remedy the defects until the solution that the Company provided operates within the project specifications. The Company is
not
typically obligated by contract to provide its clients with any refunds of the fees they have paid, although a small number of its contracts provide for the payment of liquidated damages upon default. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering professional errors and omissions, property damage and general liability that reduce its monetary exposure for warranty-related claims and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
The Company’s contracts typically provide for testing and client acceptance procedures that are designed to mitigate the likelihood of warranty-related claims, although there can be
no
assurance that such procedures will be effective for each project.  The Company has
not
paid any material amounts related to warranties for its solutions.  The Company sometimes commits unanticipated levels of effort to projects to remedy defects covered by its warranties.  The Company’s estimate of its exposure to warranties on contracts is immaterial as of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022.
The Company’s agreements with customers generally require the Company to indemnify the customer against claims in which the Company’s products infringe
third -party patents, copyrights, or trademarks and indemnify against product liability matters. As of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022,
the Company has
not
experienced any losses related to the indemnification obligations and
no
significant claims with respect thereto were outstanding.  The Company does
not
expect significant claims related to the indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and
no
related reserves were established.
Litigation
The Company is subject to ordinary routine litigation and claims incidental to its business. As of
December 31, 2022,
the Company was
not
engaged with any material legal proceedings.

Revenue
Our revenue is derived from two sources: (i) digital engagement services and (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses.
Digital Engagement Services
Digital engagement services revenue is comprised of implementation and retainer-related services. Total revenue from digital engagement services of $0.9 million in December 31, 2022 decreased 2% from $0.9 million in December 31, 2021. Digital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 21% in December 31, 2022 from 20% in December 31, 2021.
Subscription and Perpetual Licenses
Revenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease compared to the prior period is primarily due to a large customer, renewing for their 9th year, restructured their Website which reduced their subscription by half to $75 thousand per quarter and $0.1 million of non-recurring perpetual licenses in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 79% from 80% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Cost of Revenue
Total cost of revenue for December 31, 2022 of $1.3 million was consistent with $1.3 million in the prior year comparable period.
Cost of Digital Engagement Services
Cost of digital engagement services decreased 7%, to $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cost of digital engagement services is primarily due to personnel costs. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 49% from 52%. The decrease as a percentage of revenues in December 2022 compared to December 2021 is primarily due to the overall decrease in personnel costs.
Cost of Subscription and Perpetual License
Cost of subscription and perpetual licenses increased 4% to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of subscription and perpetual licenses is primarily due to higher costs to operate our cloud-based hosting model with Amazon Web Services to support increased holiday traffic and additional personnel costs. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue increased to 27% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 24% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the overall decrease in subscription and perpetual license revenue.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $2.8 million decreased $0.2 million, or 7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The gross profit margin decreased to 69% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 70% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the gross profit margin for December 2022 compared to December 2021 is primarily attributable to the decrease in the proportion of license revenue, which is generally associated with higher margins, to digital engagement service revenue.

Sales and marketing expenses of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 2% from $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was 30% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 29% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in expenses compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to lower personnel costs offsetting additional sales and marketing costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 5% from $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue remained consistent at 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The decrease in costs is primarily due to lower personnel costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expense of $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $0.1 million, or 13%, from $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 18% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. These decreases compared to the prior period are primarily attributable to lower personnel costs.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense of $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 11% from $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 10% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. These decreases are primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets from prior business acquisitions.
Income (loss) from Operations
The loss from operations was $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss from operations of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $0.1 million or 24%.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities
The Company recognized a gain related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $0.3 million and $2.4 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $6 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $3 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Income tax expense consists of estimated liability for federal and state income taxes owed by the Company.  Net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards are estimated to be sufficient to offset any potential taxable income for all periods presented. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.
27
Adjusted EBITDA
We also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP (“Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, non-cash warrant related expenses, other income and expenses, change in fair value of derivative instruments, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and restructuring and acquisition related charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”).
We believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations.
Adjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for U.S. GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations because it excludes the financial statement impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, goodwill impairment, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, loss on disposal of assets, other amortization, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and restructuring charges, acquisition related expenses, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
The following table reconciles net income (loss) (which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure) to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities was $82 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $79 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The change in cash provided by operating activities, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $6 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, related primarily to purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was $64 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021, related software capitalization costs and purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2021. Cash used in financing activities was $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to payments of long-term debt and deferred purchase price payable and contingent consideration payments.
28
Capital Resources and Liquidity Outlook
In connection with an acquisition of a business completed during the 2021 fiscal year (WooRank), the Company assumed the outstanding long-term debt obligations of which approximately $1.1 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2022, with $0.4 million payable over the next twelve months.
The Company has historically incurred operating losses and used cash on hand and from financing activities to fund operations as well as develop new products. The Company believes that future revenues and cash flows will supplement its working capital and it has an appropriate cost structure to support future revenue growth.
The Company may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, up to $50 million of its debt or equity securities, or any combination thereof.  Such securities offerings may be made pursuant to the Company’s currently effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-262764), which was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2022 and declared effective on March 4, 2022 (the “Shelf Registration”).  A complete description of the types of securities that the Company may sell is described in the Preliminary Prospectus contained in the Shelf Registration.   As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report, there are no active offerings for the sale or obligations to purchase any of the Company’s securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration.  There can be no assurances that the Company will offer any securities for sale or that if the Company does offer any securities that it will be successful in selling any portion of the securities offered on a timely basis if at all, or on terms acceptable to us.  Further, our ability to offer or sell such securities may be limited by rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons.
Contractual Obligations
We lease all of our office locations. The gross obligations for operating leases and subleases is $0.5 million, of which $0.2 million is expected in the next twelve months. Debt payments on the Company’s various debt obligations total $1.1 million of which $0.4 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies
These critical accounting policies and estimates by our management were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and should be read in conjunction with Note 2
Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 21, 2022.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.
29
We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:
●
Revenue recognition;
●
Allowance for doubtful accounts;
●
Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets;
●
Accounting for business combinations;
●
Accounting for common stock purchase warrants; and
●
Accounting for stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenue from two sources: (i) Software Licenses, which are comprised of subscription fees (“SaaS”), perpetual software licenses, and maintenance for post-customer support (“PCS”) on perpetual licenses, and (ii) Digital Engagement Services, which are professional services to implement our products such as web development, digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering search. Customers who license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as “Software as a Service” or “SaaS”, do not take possession of the software.
Revenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company’s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax.
The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:
1.
Identify the customer contract;
2.
Identify performance obligations that are distinct;
3.
Determine the transaction price;
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and
5.
Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.
We analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.
Accounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The purpose of an impairment test is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to its fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Factors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as operational, economic and competitive factors specific to the key assumptions underlying the fair value estimate we use in our impairment testing that have a reasonable possibility of changing. This could include a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant decline in our stock price.
30
Accounting for Business Combinations
The Company allocates the amount it pays for each acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets which arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. The Company allocates any excess purchase price that exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated growth rates, cash flows and discounts rates and estimated useful lives could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments expected to be made as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value through income (loss) before income taxes within the consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting for Common Stock Purchase Warrants
The Company evaluates common stock warrants as they are issued to determine whether they should be classified as an equity instrument or a liability. Those warrants that are classified as a liability are carried at fair value at each reporting period, with changes in their fair value recognized in change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Company’s warrant liabilities are valued utilizing Level 3 inputs. Warrant liabilities are valued using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model, which takes into consideration the volatilities of comparable public companies, due to the relatively low trading volume of the Company’s common stock. The Monte Carlo option-pricing model uses certain assumptions, including expected life and annual volatility.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
At December 31, 2022, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 8 of these consolidated financial statements.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation-Stock
Topic of the Codification.  Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.
We recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years.  In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly.  We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate.  Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ.  In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we recognize a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.
We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model.  The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions, including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options.  The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States Treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards.  We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends.  In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers.  Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we recognize to vary.
We recognize deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.

Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
