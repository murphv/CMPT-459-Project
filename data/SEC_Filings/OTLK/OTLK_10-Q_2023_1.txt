Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potentially,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions in this report. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including risks described in the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on December 29, 2022, including, among other things, risks associated with: ● the initiation, timing, progress and results of our clinical trials of our lead product candidate, ONS-5010; ● our reliance on our contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors; ● whether the results of our clinical trials will be sufficient to support domestic or global regulatory approvals; ● our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for ONS-5010 in the United States and other markets; ● our expectations regarding the potential market size and the size of the patient populations for our product candidates, if approved, for commercial use; ● our ability to fund our working capital requirements, and our expectations regarding our current cash resources; ● the rate and degree of market acceptance of our current and future product candidates, including our commercialization strategy and manufacturing capabilities for ONS-5010; ● the implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business and product candidates; ● developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; ● our ability to maintain and establish collaborations or obtain additional funding; ● our expectations regarding government and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement; ● our ability to compete in the markets we serve; ● the factors that may impact our financial results; and ● our estimates regarding the sufficiency of our cash resources and our need for additional funding. ​ These risks are not exhaustive. Additional factors could harm our business and financial performance, such as risks associated with the current macroeconomic environment, including as a result of the ongoing novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic or political disruption such as the war between Ukraine and Russia. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or developments. Thus, you should not assume that our silence over time means that actual events are bearing out as expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this report by these cautionary statements. ​ ​ ii

Table of Contents Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements ​ 1.     Organization and Description of Business Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (“Outlook” or the “Company”) was incorporated in New Jersey on January 5, 2010, started operations in July 2011, reincorporated in Delaware by merging with and into a Delaware corporation in October 2015 and changed its name to “Outlook Therapeutics, Inc.” in November 2018. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing ONS-5010, an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications. The Company is based in Iselin, New Jersey.
All development activities are currently active in support of the Company’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) registration program for ONS-5010 for wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”). In fiscal year 2022, the Company submitted the BLA and received confirmation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that the BLA had been accepted for filing with a goal date of August 29, 2023 for a review decision by the FDA. Additionally, the Company submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which has been validated for review with an estimated decision date expected in early 2024. ​ 2.    Liquidity The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and has an accumulated deficit of $ 427,598,031
as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 31,845,197
of principal and accrued interest due under an unsecured convertible promissory note issued in December 2022 (the “December 2022 Note”), maturing on January 1, 2024. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its operations through the anticipated approval of the BLA for ONS-5010 in the third calendar quarter of 2023 and into the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations in the future and to commercially develop ONS-5010 and to develop any other product candidates. Management is currently evaluating different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations such as continuing to access capital through the current At-the-Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM Agreement” or the “ATM Offering”), dated March 26, 2021, with H.C. Wainwright & Co., as sales agent (“Wainwright” or the “Agent”) (refer to Note 9 for further details on the ATM Offering) and negotiating a potential extension of maturity for notes that are scheduled to mature in January 2024. These strategies may also include, but are not limited to, proceeds from potential licensing and/or marketing arrangements or collaborations with pharmaceutical or other companies, the issuance of equity securities, the issuance of additional debt, and revenues from potential future product sales, if any. There can be no assurance that these future funding efforts will be successful. The Company’s future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including (i) the timely and successful completion of additional financing discussed above; (ii) the Company’s ability to successfully begin marketing of its product candidates or complete revenue-generating partnerships with other companies; (iii) the success of its research and development; (iv) the development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; and, ultimately, (v) regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company’s proposed future products. 5
Table of Contents Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements ​ 3.     Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments (which consist primarily of accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the financial statements) considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2022 and its results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and stockholders’ equity for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending September 30, 2023. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements presented herein do not contain all of the required disclosures under GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022. Use of estimates The preparation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, such as the current macroeconomic environment, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or political disruption such as the war between Ukraine and Russia, actual results may materially vary from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Net loss per share Basic and diluted net loss per common share is determined by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of calculating diluted loss per common share, the denominator includes both the weighted average common shares outstanding and the number of common stock equivalents if the inclusion of such common stock equivalents would be dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities include warrants, performance-based stock options and units, stock options and non-vested restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards using the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to compute basic and diluted shares due to the Company’s loss. The following table sets forth the computation of basic loss per share and diluted loss per share: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended December 31,  ​      2022      2021 Net loss attributable to common stockholders ​ $
( 18,662,513 ) ​ $

Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements ​ The following potentially dilutive securities (in common stock equivalents) have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, as they would be antidilutive: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As of December 31,  ​      2022      2021 Performance-based stock units ​

— ​ (i) The potentially dilutive securities related to convertible debt are calculated based on a fixed conversion price of

per share, which is subject to change as described in Note 7. ​ Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40) . ASU 2020-06 eliminated the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models in ASC 470-20 that required separate accounting for embedded conversion features and simplifies the settlement assessment to determine whether a contract qualifies for equity classification. In addition, the new guidance requires entities to use the if-converted method to calculate earnings per share for all convertible instruments and to include the effect of share settlement for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on October 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the guidance to all financial instruments that were outstanding as of the beginning of 2022. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as a result of adopting ASU 2020-06. ​ There have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ​ ​ 4.     Fair Value Measurements Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable: ● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ● Level 2 - Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. ● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques. The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 7

Equity Method Investment ​ In connection with the execution of a stock purchase agreement with Syntone Ventures LLC (“Syntone Ventures”), the United States-based affiliate of Syntone Technologies Group Co. Ltd. (“Syntone PRC”) on May 22, 2020, the Company and Syntone PRC entered into a joint venture agreement pursuant to which they agreed to form a People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) joint venture, Beijing Syntone Biopharma Ltd (“Syntone”), that is
80 % owned by Syntone PRC and
20 % owned by the Company. As the Company can exert significant influence over, but does not control, Syntone’s operations through voting rights or representation on Syntone’s board of directors, the Company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting. Upon formation of Syntone in April 2021, the Company entered into a royalty-free license with Syntone for the development, commercialization and manufacture of ONS-5010 in the greater China market, which includes Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. The Company made the initial investment of $ 900,000
in June 2020 and expects to be required to make an additional capital contribution to Syntone of approximately $ 2,100,000 , which will be made within
four years
after the establishment date in accordance with the development plan contemplated in the license agreement or on such other terms within such
four-year
period. The maximum exposure to a loss as a result of the Company’s involvement in Syntone is limited to the initial investment and the future capital contributions of approximately $ 2,100,000 . ​ 6.     Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consists of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022 ​ September 30, 2022 Compensation ​ $

The December 2022 Note has an original issue discount of $ 1,820,000 . The Company received net proceeds of $ 18,052,461
upon the closing on December 28, 2022 after deducting the Lender’s transaction costs in connection with the issuance and a full payment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the November 2021 Note. The November 2021 Note was cancelled upon repayment. See
9
Table of Contents Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements ​ below for additional disclosures relating to November 2021 Note. The December 2022 Note bears interest at
9.5 % per annum and matures on January 1, 2024. The December 2022 Note contains customary covenants, including a restriction on the Company’s ability to pledge certain of the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions, without the Lender’s consent. Beginning on April 1, 2023, the Lender will have the right to convert the December 2022 Note at the Conversion Price (as defined below). The principal amount and conversion price of the December 2022 Note are subject to adjustment upon certain triggering events.  In addition, the Company has the right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding balance under the December 2022 Note into shares of common stock at the Conversion Price if certain conditions have been met at the time of conversion, including if at any time after the six-month anniversary of the closing date, the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock on Nasdaq equals or exceeds $ 2.50
per share (subject to adjustments for stock splits and stock combinations) for a period of
30
consecutive trading days. Payments may be made by the Company (i) in cash, (ii) in shares of common stock, with the number of shares being equal to the portion of the applicable payment amount divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. Any payments made by the Company in cash, including prepayments or repayment at maturity, will be subject to an additional fee of 7.5%. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the December 2022 Note, including, among others, the Company’s failure to pay amounts due and payable under the December 2022 Note, events of insolvency or bankruptcy, failure to observe covenants contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the December 2022 Note, breaches of representations and warranties in the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the occurrence of certain transactions without the Lender’s consent, each such event, a Trigger Event, the Lender shall have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to increase the balance of the December 2022 Note by 10% for a Major Trigger Event (as defined in the December 2022 Note) and 5% for a Minor Trigger Event (as defined in the December 2022 Note). If a Trigger Event is not cured within ten (10) trading days of written notice thereof from the Lender, it will result in an event of default (such event, an “Event of Default”). Following an Event of Default, the Lender may accelerate the December 2022 Note such that all amounts thereunder become immediately due and payable, and interest shall accrue at a rate of 22% annually until paid. Under the December 2022 Note, “Conversion Price” means, prior to a Major Trigger Event, $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits and stock combinations), and following a Major Trigger Event, the lesser of (i) $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits and stock combinations), and (ii) 90% multiplied by the lowest closing bid price of the Company’s common stock in the three trading days prior to the date on which the conversion notice is delivered. In February 2023, the December 2022 Note was amended to provide that if the Conversion Price is below $0.1756 per share, the Company will be required to satisfy a conversion notice from the Lender in cash. While the December 2022 Note is outstanding, the Lender will have a consent right on any future variable rate transactions or any debt. Lender will also have a 10% participation right in any future debt or equity financings. The Company elected to account for the December  2022 Note at fair value (Note 4) and was not required to bifurcate the conversion option as a derivative and as result the original issue discount of $ 1,820,000
and debt issuance costs were written off upon election to fair value and accounted for as interest. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 the Company recognized $ 2,074,964
of interest expense related to the December 2022 Note related to original issue discount of $ 1,820,000
and other third party debt issuance costs of $ 254,964
as the Company elected the fair value option. ​ Unsecured promissory note ​ On November 16, 2021, the Company received $ 10,000,000
in net proceeds from the issuance of the November 2021 Note with a face amount of $ 10,220,000 . Debt issuance costs totaling $ 820,000
were recorded as debt discount and were deducted from the principal in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The debt discount was amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt using the effective interest method. The November 2021 Note bore interest at a rate of
9.5 % per annum compounding daily and was set to mature on January 1, 2023. The Company could prepay all or a portion of the November 2021 Note at any time by paying
105 % of the outstanding balance elected for pre-payment. ​ As discussed above, the November 2021 Note was cancelled using proceeds from the December 2022 Note issued to the same lender. The total repayment was $ 11,947,539 , which represented
105 % of the outstanding balance and included $ 1,158,609
of interest expense. The transaction has been accounted for as an extinguishment of the November 2021 Note.

100 % of the shares upon the earliest to occur of (i) filing of the BLA for ONS-5010, (ii) termination of the agreement by the consultant for good reason or by the Company other than for cause, (iii) in the event of disability, or (iv) upon a change in control. ​ The grant date fair value of the restricted shares was $ 0.54
per share and equal to the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock at the time of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the explicit service period or derived service period, which was determined to be
4.8
years at the time of grant. The compensation expense was accelerated during the year ended September 30, 2022 as a result of the Company achieving certain performance conditions related to the Company’s BLA submission and the corresponding repurchase rights lapsing. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock of $ 151,764 . There was no expense recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2022, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock. ​ ​ 11 .   Related-Party Transactions MTTR - strategic partnership agreement (ONS-5010) In February 2018, the Company entered into a strategic partnership agreement with MTTR to advise on regulatory, clinical and commercial strategy and assist in obtaining approval of ONS-5010.
In November 2018, the board of directors of the Company appointed Mr. Terry Dagnon as Chief Operations Officer and Mr. Jeff Evanson as Chief Commercial Officer. Both Mr. Dagnon and Mr. Evanson initially provided services to the Company pursuant to the February 2018 strategic partnership agreement with MTTR, as amended. Mr. Dagnon and Mr. Evanson were both principals in MTTR. Both Mr. Dagnon and Mr. Evanson were compensated directly by MTTR for services provided to the Company as the Company's Chief Operations Officer and Chief Commercial Officer, respectively, pursuant to the strategic partnership agreement until such agreement, as amended, was terminated effective March 19, 2020.

These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company working to launch the first ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use in retinal indications. Our goal is to launch directly in the United States as the first and only approved ophthalmic bevacizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. Our plans also include potentially securing a strategic partner for the United Kingdom, Europe, Japan and other markets. If approved, we expect to receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States and up to 10 years of regulatory exclusivity in the European Union. Bevacizumab is a full-length, humanized anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) recombinant monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that inhibits VEGF and associated angiogenic activity. In March 2022, we submitted a BLA with the FDA for ONS-5010 (LYTENAVA (bevacizumab-vikg)), an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab, which we have developed to be administered as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. In May 2022, we voluntarily withdrew our BLA to provide additional information requested by the FDA. Following receipt of further correspondence from the FDA, we confirmed the additional information necessary to re-submit the BLA for ONS-5010 and resubmitted the BLA in August 2022. In October 2022, we received confirmation from the FDA that our BLA has been accepted for filing with a goal date of August 29, 2023 for a review decision by the FDA. Additionally, in October 2022, we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for ONS-5010 with the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. On December 22, 2022 our MAA was validated for review by the EMA. The formal review process of the MAA by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is now set to begin with an estimated decision date expected in early 2024. ONS-5010 is our sole product candidate in active development.
Our BLA and MAA registration program for ONS-5010 in wet AMD involved three clinical trials, which we refer to as NORSE ONE, NORSE TWO and NORSE THREE. The study design for our clinical program to evaluate ONS-5010 as an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab was reviewed at an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in April 2018, and we filed our investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA in the first quarter of calendar 2019. In August 2020, we reported achieving the anticipated safety and efficacy and positive proof-of-concept topline results from NORSE ONE, a clinical experience study. NORSE TWO is our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial comparing ONS-5010 (bevacizumab- 18
Table of Contents vikg) to ranibizumab (LUCENTIS). The topline results reported from NORSE TWO in August 2021 showed that ONS-5010 met the primary and key secondary endpoint for efficacy with clinically impactful change observed for treated patients. The NORSE TWO primary endpoint difference in proportion of subjects gaining at least 15 letters in Best Corrected Visual Acuity, or BCVA, score was met and was both highly statistically significant and clinically relevant. In the intent to treat, or ITT, primary dataset, the percentage of patients who gained at least 15 letters who were treated with ONS-5010, was 41.7%, and the percentage of patients who gained at least 15 letters who were treated with ranibizumab was 23.1% (p = 0.0052). The primary endpoint was also statistically significant and clinically relevant in the secondary per protocol, or PP, dataset (p = 0.04) where the percentages were almost identical, at 41.0% with ONS-5010, and 24.7% with ranibizumab. The key secondary endpoint BCVA score change from baseline to month 11 in the primary ITT dataset was also highly statistically significant and clinically relevant (p = 0.0043). A mean change of 11.2 letters in BCVA score was observed with ONS-5010, and with ranibizumab the mean change was 5.8 letters. The results were also statistically significant in the secondary PP dataset (p = 0.05) with a mean change with ONS-5010 of 11.1 letters versus 7.0 letters with ranibizumab. Results were also positive for the remaining NORSE TWO secondary endpoints with 56.5% (p = 0.0016) of ONS-5010 subjects gaining ≥ 10 letters of vision and 68.5% (p = 0.0116) of ONS-5010 subjects gaining ≥ 5 letters of vision. NORSE THREE is an open-label safety study we conducted to ensure the adequate number of safety exposures to ONS-5010 were available for the initial ONS-5010 BLA submission with the FDA. In March 2021, we reported that the results from NORSE THREE showed a positive safety profile for ONS-5010.
Additionally, in November 2021, we began enrolling patients in our NORSE SEVEN clinical trial. The study compares the safety of ophthalmic bevacizumab in vials versus pre-filled syringes in subjects diagnosed with a retinal condition that would benefit from treatment with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, including exudative age-related macular degeneration, DME, or BRVO. Subjects will be treated for three months, and the enrollment of subjects in the arm of the study receiving ONS-5010 in vials has been completed. We have also received agreement from the FDA on three Special Protocol Assessments, or SPAs, for three additional registration clinical trials for our ongoing Phase 3 program for ONS-5010. The agreements reached with the FDA on these SPAs cover the protocols for NORSE FOUR, a registration clinical trial evaluating ONS-5010 to treat BRVO, and NORSE FIVE and NORSE SIX, two registration clinical trials evaluating ONS-5010 to treat DME. We intend to initiate these studies following the anticipated FDA approval of our BLA for wet AMD. Currently, the cancer drug Avastin (bevacizumab) is used off-label for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases such as DME and BRVO even though Avastin has not been approved by regulatory authorities for use in these diseases. In addition to our BLA submission in the United States, we have submitted an MAA for approval in Europe and plan to submit for regulatory approval in multiple other markets, including the United Kingdom and other major markets. Because there are no approved bevacizumab products for the treatment of retinal diseases in the United States and other major markets, we submitted a standard BLA, and are not using the biosimilar drug development pathway that would be required if Avastin were an approved drug for the targeted diseases. If approved, we believe ONS-5010 has potential to mitigate risks associated with off-label use of unapproved bevacizumab. Off-label use of unapproved bevacizumab is currently estimated to account for approximately 50% of all wet AMD injections in the United States. Going Concern Through December 31, 2022 we have funded substantially all of our operations with $465.2 million in proceeds from the sale and issuance of our equity and debt securities. We have also received $29.0 million pursuant to our collaboration and licensing agreements through such date. Our net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $18.7 million. We also had a net loss of $14.5 million for the three months ended December 30, 2021. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant sales of ONS-5010 or any other product candidate we may develop. We evaluated whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our current cash resources of $52.3 million as of December 31, 2022 are expected to fund our operations through the anticipated approval of ONS-5010 in the third calendar quarter of 2023 and into the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our planned future operations, receive approval for and commercialize ONS-5010, commence and continue clinical trials, or develop other product candidates. We plan to finance
19
Table of Contents our future operations with a combination of proceeds from potential licensing and/or marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, the issuance of equity securities and the issuance of additional debt, potential collaborations and revenues from potential future product sales, if any. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing for the development and commercialization of ONS-5010 or any other current or future product candidates. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Collaboration, License and Strategic Partnership Agreements From time to time, we enter into collaboration and license agreements for the research and development, manufacture and/or commercialization of our products and/or product candidates. These agreements generally provide for non-refundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. We have also licensed rights to our inactive biosimilar program product candidates (ONS-3010, ONS-1045 and ONS-1050) in other markets. Syntone – PRC Joint Venture In May 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Syntone, pursuant to which we sold and issued in June 2020, in a private placement, 16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $16.0 million. In connection with the entry into the stock purchase agreement, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Syntone’s affiliate based in the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, pursuant to which we agreed to form a PRC joint venture that is 80% owned by Syntone’s PRC affiliate and 20% owned by us. Upon formation of the PRC joint venture in April 2021, we entered into a royalty-free license with the PRC joint venture for the development, commercialization and manufacture of ONS-5010 in the greater China market, which includes Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We used approximately $0.9 million of the proceeds from the May 2020 private placement to Syntone Ventures to fund our initial capital contribution to the PRC joint venture and expect to be required to make an additional capital contribution to the PRC joint venture of approximately $2.1 million within the next four years.
Selexis SA In October 2011, we entered into a research license agreement with Selexis whereby we acquired a non-exclusive license to conduct research internally or in collaboration with third parties to develop recombinant proteins from cell lines created in mammalian cells using the Selexis expression technology, or the Selexis Technology. The research license expired on October 9, 2018 and accordingly, we are no longer using the Selexis Technology in our research. Selexis also granted us a non-transferrable option to obtain a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide commercial license under the Selexis Technology to manufacture, or have manufactured, a recombinant protein produced by a cell line developed using the Selexis Technology for clinical testing and commercial sale. We exercised this option in April 2013 and entered into three commercial license agreements with Selexis for our ONS-3010, ONS-1045 (which covers ONS-5010) and ONS-1050 product candidates. We paid an upfront licensing fee to Selexis for each commercial license and also agreed to pay a fixed milestone payment for each licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay a single-digit royalty on a final product-by-final product and country-by-country basis, based on worldwide net sales of such final products by us or any of our affiliates or sub-licensees during the royalty term. At any time during the term, we have the right to terminate our royalty payment obligation by providing written notice to Selexis and paying Selexis a royalty termination fee. The initiation of our Phase 3 clinical program for ONS-5010 triggered a CHF 65,000 (approximately $0.1 million) milestone payment under the commercial license agreement, which we paid in November 2019. Components of our Results of Operations Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 20
Table of Contents ● expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials; ● expenses incurred by us directly, as well as under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches; ● outsourced professional scientific development services; ● employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; ● payments made under a third-party assignment agreement, under which we acquired intellectual property; ● expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; ● laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities; and ● allocated expenses, utilities and other facility-related costs. ​ The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our other product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: ● the number of clinical sites included in the trials; ● the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; ● the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials; ● the number of doses patients receive; ● the duration of patient follow-up; ● the results of our clinical trials; ● the establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities; ● the receipt of marketing approvals; and ● the commercialization of product candidates. ​ Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment and follow-up in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size, complexity and duration of later-stage clinical trials. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs and professional fees for business development, legal, auditing and tax services and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, and we anticipate an increase in payroll and expense as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, particularly as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product. (Income) Loss on Equity Method Investment 21
Table of Contents (Income) loss on equity method investment represents our proportionate share for the period of the net (income) loss of our investee to which the equity method of accounting is applied. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of cash paid and non-cash interest expense related to our unsecured notes, unsecured promissory notes, finance leases and other finance obligations. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Loss on extinguishment of debt is related to the prepayment and cancellation or amendment of  promissory notes during the period that was accounted for as an extinguishment. Change in Fair Value of Promissory Notes
The change in fair value relates to the promissory notes that we elected to account for at fair value. As permitted under ASC 825, we elected the fair value option to account for our promissory notes. We record the promissory notes at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability We issued warrants to purchase our common stock in conjunction with our old senior secured notes, which are classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations as other (income) expense.
Income Taxes Since inception, we have not recorded any United States federal or state income tax benefits (excluding the sale of New Jersey state net operating losses, or NOLs, and research and development, or R&D, tax credits) for the net losses we have incurred in each year or on our earned R&D tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of September 30, 2022, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of $339.9 million and $175.7 million, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2030 and 2039, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, we had federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $2.4 million available to reduce future tax liabilities, which begin to expire starting in 2023. As of September 30, 2022, we also had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of $10.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred in the past. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after our initial public offering, or IPO, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs are also subject to international regulations, which could restrict our ability to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA. The IRA contains a number of tax related provisions including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations as well as an exercise tax on stock repurchases, both provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We are in the process of evaluating the IRA, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. 22

We saw a significant increase in ONS-5010 development costs of $2.2 million as we continued with our ongoing necessary process characterization and manufacturing scale up activities with external partners to support our commercial launch. The increase was offset by a cash refund received during the period related to BLA submission fees of $2.3 million incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents stock-based compensation expenses due to an increase in headcount to support the planned launch of ONS-5010, if approved. Interest expense Interest expense increased by $2.1 million to $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily related to the original issue discount on the December 2022 Note. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million was recorded related to the prepayment and cancellation of a promissory note during the three months ended December 30, 2022 that was accounted for as an extinguishment. We recognized a $1.0 million loss on extinguishment related to an unsecured promissory note amendment during the three months ended December 30, 2021 period that was accounted for as an extinguishment of the old promissory note. Change in Fair Value of Promissory Notes
The change in fair value relates to the promissory notes that we elected to account for at fair value. As permitted under ASC 825, we elected the fair value option to account for our promissory notes. We record the promissory notes at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the change in fair value was immaterial. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded income of $0.3 million related to the decrease in the fair value of our common stock warrant liability as a result of the decrease in the price of our common stock during the period .
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Through December 31, 2022, we have funded substantially all of our operations with $465.2 million in net proceeds from the sale and issuance of our equity securities, debt securities and borrowings under debt facilities. We have also received an aggregate of $29.0 million pursuant to emerging markets collaboration and licensing agreements for our inactive biosimilar development programs.
We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant sales of ONS-5010 or any other product candidate we may develop. We will need additional financing to fund our operations and to commercially develop ONS-5010 or any other product candidate we may develop. Management is currently evaluating various strategic opportunities to obtain the required funding for future operations. These strategies may include but are not limited to potential licensing and/or marketing arrangements or collaborations with pharmaceutical or other companies, the issuance of equity securities, the issuance of additional debt, and revenues from potential future product sales, if any. Alternatively, we may be required to, among other things, modify our clinical trial plans for ONS-5010 in additional indications, make reductions in our workforce, scale back our plans and place certain activities on hold, discontinue our development programs, liquidate all or a portion of our assets, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On November 5, 2020, we received $10.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of an unsecured promissory note, or 2020 Note, with a face amount of $10.2 million. The 2020 Note bore interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum, and was due to mature on January 1, 2022, and included an original issue discount of $0.2 million. On November 16, 2021, we entered into a note amendment, which, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date to January 1, 2023, (ii) increased the interest rate from 7.5% per annum to 10% per annum beginning on January 1, 2022, and (iii) provided for the lender’s right to redeem some or all of the outstanding balance of the 2020 Note for shares of our common stock beginning July 1, 2022, subject to certain limitations. On June 30, 2022, we prepaid the 2020 Note in full by paying 105% of the outstanding balance. The total payment was $12.9 million, which included interest of $1.5 million and other fees totaling $1.2 million. 24
Table of Contents On November 16, 2021, we received $10.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the November 2021 Note, with a face amount of $10.2 million. The November 2021 Note bore interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, was due to mature January 1, 2023 and included an original issue discount of $0.2 million. We may prepay all or a portion of the note at any time by paying 105% of the outstanding balance elected for pre-payment. On December 28, 2022, we prepaid the November 2021 Note in full by paying 105% of the outstanding balance. The total payment was $11.9 million, which included interest of $1.2 million and a prepayment fee of $0.6 million. In November 2021, we issued in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 46,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price per share of $1.25 for $54.0 million in net proceeds after payment of underwriter discounts and commissions and other underwriter offering costs. GMS Ventures purchased an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares of common stock in the public offering. In connection with the underwritten public offering, we issued the underwriter warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.5625 per share, which warrants have a five-year term.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we sold 895,391 shares of common stock, and generated $1.1 million in gross proceeds from, the ATM Offering. The sales agent fees paid were immaterial. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 1,773,974 shares of common stock under the ATM Offering and generated $3.6 million in gross proceeds and we paid fees to the sales agent and other issuance costs of $0.1 million. In December 2022, in a registered direct equity offering to certain institutional and accredited investors, including GMS Ventures, our largest stockholder, we issued 28,460,831 shares of common stock at a purchase price per share of $0.8784 for $24.0 million in net proceeds after payment of placement agent fees and other offering costs. GMS Ventures purchased an aggregate of 14,230,418 shares of common stock in the registered direct equity offering. In connection with the registered direct equity offering, we issued to M.S. Howells & Co., as placement agent for certain accredited investors in the offering, warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 515,755 shares of common stock, which will be exercisable commencing on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the offering at an exercise price of $1.05 per share, which warrants have a three-year term. On December 22, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and issued an unsecured convertible promissory note with a face amount of $31.8 million, or the December 2022 Note, to Streeterville Capital, LLC, or the Lender, the current holder of our outstanding unsecured promissory note that was due to mature on January 1, 2023, or the November 2021 Note. The Note has an original issue discount of $1.8 million. We received gross proceeds of $30.0 million upon the closing on December 28, 2022, after deducting the Lender’s transaction costs in connection with the issuance. A portion of the proceeds from the December 2022 Note were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the November 2021 Note, which was cancelled upon repayment. The December 2022 Note bears interest at 9.5% per annum and matures on January 1, 2024. The December 2022 Note contains customary covenants, including a restriction on our ability to pledge certain of our assets, subject to certain exceptions, without the Lender’s consent. Beginning on April 1, 2023, the Lender will have the right to convert the December 2022 Note at an initial conversion price of $2.00 per share. The principal amount and conversion price of the December 2022 Note are subject to adjustment upon certain triggering events.  See “Description of Indebtedness” below for additional detail. We evaluated whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $427.6 million. In addition, $31.8 million of principal and accrued interest under an unsecured convertible promissory note, which bears interest compounding daily and mature January 1, 2024. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our current cash resources of $52.3 million as of December 31, 2022 are expected to fund our operations through the anticipated approval of the ONS-5010 BLA expected in the third calendar quarter of 2023 and into the fourth calendar quarter of 2023.
Our future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including (i) the timely and successful completion of additional financing discussed above; (ii) our ability to successfully begin marketing of our product candidates or complete revenue-generating partnerships with other companies; (iii) the success of our research and development; (iv) the development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; and, ultimately, (v) regulatory approval and market acceptance of our proposed future products. Additionally, while the long-term economic impact of either the COVID-19 pandemic or the war between Ukraine and Russia is difficult to assess or predict, each of
25
Table of Contents these events has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets and contributed to a general global economic slowdown. Furthermore, inflation rates, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, have increased recently to levels not seen in decades. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised, and is expected to further raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may further increase economic uncertainty and heighten these risks. If the disruptions and slowdown deepen or persist, we may not be able to access additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, which could in the future negatively affect our ability to pursue our business strategy. Funding Requirements We anticipate we will incur net losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to complete the development and initiate commercialization of ONS-5010 if, among other things, the FDA does not approve our BLA when we expect, or at all, or if we are not able to enter into strategic partnerships for ONS-5010 providing for sufficient funding of our expected commercial and development costs and we are unable to obtain such funding elsewhere. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, manufacturing and facility costs, external research and development services, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses and administrative and overhead costs. Our future funding requirements will be heavily determined by the resources needed to support development of our lead product candidate and any other product candidates we may choose to pursue. We believe our existing cash of $52.3 million as of December 31, 2022 can fund our operations through the anticipated approval of ONS-5010 in the third calendar quarter of 2023 and into the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We may need to raise substantial additional capital to complete our planned ONS-5010 development and commercialization program. We plan to finance our future operations with a combination of proceeds from our ATM Offering, renegotiation of the maturity date for existing unsecured notes, proceeds from potential licensing and/or marketing arrangements or collaborations with pharmaceutical or other companies, the issuance of equity securities, the issuance of additional debt, and revenues from potential future product sales, if any. If we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our common stock. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing for the development and commercialization of ONS-5010 or any other current or future product candidates. Alternatively, we may be required to, among other things, modify our clinical trial plans for ONS-5010 in additional indications, make reductions in our workforce, scale back our plans and place certain activities on hold, discontinue our development programs, liquidate all or a portion of our assets, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended December 31,  ​      2022      2021 Net cash used in operating activities ​ $
(8,901,246) ​ $
(10,990,258) Net cash provided by financing activities ​ ​
43,845,282 ​ ​
66,663,858 Net increase in cash ​ $ $ 34,944,036 ​ $ $ 55,673,600 ​ Operating Activities 26
Table of Contents During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $8.9 million of cash in operating activities resulting primarily from our net loss of $18.7 million. This use of cash was partially offset by $4.5 million of non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, income on equity method investment and depreciation and amortization expense. We also paid interest on debt of $1.2 million during the period. The net cash inflow of $6.5 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.7 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.8 million for timing of payments associated with ONS-5010 development costs.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we used $11.0 million of cash in operating activities resulting primarily from our net loss of $14.5 million. This use of cash was partially offset by $2.6 million of non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, change in fair value of unsecured convertible promissory note, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on equity method investment and depreciation and amortization expense. The net cash inflow of $0.9 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of $0.2 million and an increase of $1.0 million in accrued expenses due to an increase in NORSE SEVEN clinical trial costs. These inflows were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.3 million for prepayments associated with ONS 5010 development costs . Financing Activities During the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.8 million, primarily attributable to $23.5 million in net proceeds from
a registered direct equity offering in December 2022 of an aggregate of 28,460,831 shares of our common stock and accompanying 515,755 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, $1.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Offering and $30.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of an unsecured convertible promissory note with a face amount of $31.8 million in December 2022. We also made $10.2 million in debt and finance lease obligation payments and a $0.6 million payment of financing costs. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $66.7 million, primarily attributable to $54.1 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering in November 2021 of an aggregate of 46,000,000 shares of our common stock and accompanying 2,100,000 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, $3.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Offering and $9.4 million in net proceeds from issuance of an unsecured promissory note with a face amount of $10.2 million in November 2021. We also made $0.4 million in debt and finance lease obligation payments . Description of Indebtedness On December 22, 2022, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement and issued the December 2022 Note to the Lender. The December 2022 Note has a face value of $31.8 million and an original issue discount of $1.8 million. The December 2022 Note bears interest at 9.5% per annum and matures on January 1, 2024. The December 2022 Note contains customary covenants, including a restriction on our ability to pledge certain of our assets, subject to certain exceptions, without the Lender’s consent. Beginning on April 1, 2023, the Lender will have the right to convert the December 2022 Note at the Conversion Price (as defined below).  The principal amount and Conversion Price of the December 2022 Note are subject to adjustment upon certain triggering events.  In addition, the Company has the right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding balance under the December 2022 Note into shares of common stock at the Conversion Price if certain conditions have been met at the time of conversion, including if at any time after the six-month anniversary of the closing date, the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock on Nasdaq equals or exceeds $2.50 per share (subject to adjustments for stock splits and stock combinations) for a period of 30 consecutive trading days. We may make payments (i) in cash, (ii) in shares of common stock, with the number of shares being equal to the portion of the applicable payment amount divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. Any payments made by us in cash, including prepayments or repayment at maturity, will be subject to an additional fee of 7.5%. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the December 2022 Note, including, among others, the Company’s failure to pay amounts due and payable under the December 2022 Note, events of insolvency or bankruptcy, failure to observe covenants contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the December 2022 Note, breaches of representations and warranties in the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the occurrence of certain transactions without the Lender’s consent, each such event, a Trigger Event, the Lender shall have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to
27
Table of Contents increase the balance of the December 2022 Note by 10% for a Major Trigger Event (as defined in the December 2022 Note) and 5% for a Minor Trigger Event (as defined in the December 2022 Note). If a Trigger Event is not cured within ten (10) trading days of written notice thereof from the Lender, it will result in an event of default, such event, an Event of Default. Following an Event of Default, the Lender may accelerate the December 2022 Note such that all amounts thereunder become immediately due and payable, and interest shall accrue at a rate of 22% annually until paid. Under the December 2022 Note, “Conversion Price” means, prior to a Major Trigger Event, $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits and stock combinations), and following a Major Trigger Event, the lesser of (i) $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits and stock combinations), and (ii) 90% multiplied by the lowest closing bid price of the Company’s common stock in the three trading days prior to the date on which the conversion notice is delivered. In February 2023, the December 2022 Note was amended to provide that if the Conversion Price is below $0.1756 per share, the Company will be required to satisfy a conversion notice from the Lender in cash. While the December 2022 Note is outstanding, the Lender will have a consent right on any future variable rate transactions or any debt. Lender will also have a 10% participation right in any future debt or equity financings. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022 have not materially changed. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a “Smaller Reporting Company,” this Item and the related disclosure is not required. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this report. ​ Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during our first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. ​ 28
