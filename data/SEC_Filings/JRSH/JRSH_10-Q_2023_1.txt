JERASH HOLDINGS (US), INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Jerash Holdings (US), Inc. (“Jerash Holdings”) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 20, 2016. Jerash Holdings is a holding company with no operations. Jerash Holdings
and its subsidiaries are herein collectively referred to as the “Company.”
Jerash Garments and Fashions Manufacturing Company
Limited (“Jerash Garments”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Holdings and was established in Amman, the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan (“Jordan”), as a limited liability company on November 26, 2000 with a declared capital of
150,000
Jordanian Dinar
(“JOD”) (approximately US$ 212,000 ).
Jerash for Industrial Embroidery Company
(“Jerash Embroidery”) and Chinese Garments and Fashions Manufacturing Company Limited (“Chinese Garments”)
were both established in Amman, Jordan, as limited liability companies on March 11, 2013 and June 13, 2013, respectively, each with
a declared capital of JOD
50,000 . Jerash Embroidery and Chinese Garments are wholly owned subsidiaries of Jerash Garments.
Al-Mutafaweq Co. for Garments Manufacturing
Ltd. (“Paramount”) is a contract garment manufacturer that was established in Amman, Jordan, as a limited liability
company on October 24, 2004 with a declared capital of JOD
100,000 . On December 11, 2018, Jerash Garments and the sole shareholder
of Paramount entered into an agreement pursuant to which Jerash Garments acquired all of the outstanding shares of stock of
Paramount. Jerash Garments assumed ownership of all of the machinery and equipment owned by Paramount. Paramount had no other

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet at that date
but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the financial statements of Jerash Holdings, and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s most significant estimates include
allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory reserve, useful lives of buildings and other property, and the measurement of
stock-based compensation expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates
Cash
The Company’s cash consists of cash on hand
and cash deposited in financial institutions. The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with an original maturity
of three months or less from the original date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company
had no cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of cash used as security
deposits to obtain credit facilities from a bank and to secure customs clearance under the requirements of local regulations. The Company
is required to keep certain amounts on deposit that are subject to withdrawal restrictions. These security deposits at the bank are refundable
only when the bank facilities are terminated. The restricted cash is classified as a current asset if the Company intends to terminate
these bank facilities within one year, and as a non-current asset if otherwise.
7
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable are recognized and carried
at the original invoiced amount less an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company usually grants extended payment terms
to customers with good credit standing and determines the adequacy of reserves for doubtful accounts based on individual account analysis
and historical collection trends. The Company establishes a provision for doubtful receivables when there is objective evidence that the
Company may not be able to collect amounts due. The allowance is based on management’s best estimates of specific losses on individual
exposures, as well as a provision on historical trends of collections. The provision is recorded against accounts receivables balances,
with a corresponding charge recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Actual amounts received may differ from management’s
estimate of creditworthiness and the economic environment. Delinquent account balances are written off against the allowance for doubtful
accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Inventories include the cost of raw materials, freight, direct labor and related production overhead. The cost of
inventories is determined using the First in, First-out method. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess or slow-moving
items and makes provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value.
Advance to Suppliers, Net
Advance to suppliers consists of balances paid
to suppliers for services or materials purchased that have not been provided or received. Advance to suppliers for services and materials
is short-term in nature. Advance to suppliers is reviewed periodically to determine whether its carrying value has become impaired. The
Company considers the assets to be impaired if the performance by the suppliers becomes doubtful. The Company uses the aging method to
estimate the allowance for the questionable balances. In addition, at each reporting date, the Company generally determines the adequacy
of allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating all available information, and then records specific allowances for those advances based
on the specific facts and circumstances.
Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at
cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense related to property, plant, and equipment
is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the
shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed
periodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items
of property, plant, and equipment. The estimated useful lives of depreciation and amortization of the principal classes of assets are
as follows:
Useful life
Land
Infinite
Property and buildings
15 - 25
years
Equipment and machinery
3 - 5
years
Office and electronic equipment
3 - 5
years
Automobiles
5
years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of useful life and lease term
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which
do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments
which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of
assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income.
Construction in Progress
Construction in Progress (“CIP”) is
recorded at cost for property, plant, and equipment where the asset is in construction or development. CIP accumulates cost of construction
and transaction costs involved in the progress of acquiring the materials for construction or development. The Company does not commence
depreciating the asset in CIP account because the asset has not yet been placed in service. Once an asset is placed in service, all costs
associated with the asset that are recorded in the CIP account are transferred to plant, plant, and equipment for the asset.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses its long-lived assets, including
property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group
may not be recoverable. Factors which may indicate potential impairment include a significant underperformance relative to the historical
or projected future operating results or a significant negative industry or economic trend. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that
asset. If impairment is indicated, a loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset.
The fair value is estimated based on the discounted future cash flows or comparable market values, if available. The Company did not record
any impairment loss during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
8
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Asset Acquisition
An asset acquisition is an acquisition
of an asset, or a group of assets, that does not meet the definition of a business, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross
assets acquired are concentrated in a single or group of similar, identifiable assets. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by using the
cost accumulation model, whereby the cost of the acquisition, including certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired
on a relative fair value basis. Determining and valuing intangible assets requires judgment.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price
paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is not amortized. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
the carrying amount of goodwill was $ 499,282 . Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators
of potential impairment exist, based on the one reporting unit. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine
whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company
compares the fair value of its only reporting unit with the carrying amounts. The Company would recognize an impairment charge for the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill
occurred for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Substantially all of the Company’s revenue
is derived from product sales, which consist of sales of the Company’s customized ready-made outerwear for large brand-name retailers
and PPE. The Company considers purchase orders to be a contract with a customer. Contracts with customers are considered to be short term
when the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of the performance obligations is equal to or less than one year. Virtually
all of the Company’s contracts are short term. The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Company typically
satisfies its performance obligations in contracts with customers upon shipment of the goods. Generally, payment is due from customers
within seven to 150 days of the invoice date. The contracts do not have significant financing components. Shipping and handling costs
associated with outbound freight from Jordan export dock are not an obligation of the Company. Returns and allowances are not a significant
aspect of the revenue recognition process as historically they have been immaterial.
The Company also derives revenue rendering cutting
and making services to other apparel vendors who subcontract order to the Company. Revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.
All of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and the transaction price is stated
in the contract, usually as a price per unit. All estimates are based on the Company’s historical experience, complete satisfaction
of the performance obligation, and the Company’s best judgment at the time the estimate is made. Historically, sales returns have
not significantly impacted the Company’s revenue.
9
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)
The Company does not have any contract assets
since the Company has an unconditional right to consideration when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and payment from
customers is not contingent on a future event. The Company had contract liabilities of $ 296,985
and $ nil
as of December 31, 2022 and March
31, 2022, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no revenue recognized from performance obligations
related to prior periods. As of December 31, 2022, $ 296,985
deferred revenue was expected to be recognized within fiscal year 2023.
The Company has one revenue generating reportable
geographic segment under ASC Topic 280 “Segment Reporting” and derives its sales primarily from its sales of customized ready-made
outerwear. The Company believes disaggregation of revenue by geographic region best depicts the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of its revenue and cash flows (see “Note 14—Segment Reporting”).
Shipping and Handling
Proceeds collected from customers for shipping
and handling costs are included in revenue. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses,
as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses. Total shipping and handling expenses were $ 573,249
and $ 571,749
for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total shipping and handling expenses were $ 1,499,052
and $ 1,557,328
for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Income and Sales Taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes on an entity
basis on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which each entity is domiciled. Jerash Holdings and Jerash Supplies
are incorporated/formed in the State of Delaware and are subject to federal income tax in the United States of America. Treasure Success
and Ever Winland are registered in Hong Kong and are subject to profit tax in Hong Kong. Jiangmen Treasure Success is incorporated in
China and is subject to corporate income tax in China. Jerash Garments, Jerash Embroidery, Chinese Garments, Paramount, Jerash The First,
MK Garments, and Kawkab Venue are subject to income tax in Jordan, unless an exemption is granted.
In accordance with Development Zone
law, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries were subject to corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 16% plus a 1% social contribution
between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, the income tax rate increased to 18% or 20%, plus a 1% social
contribution.
Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject
to local sales tax of
16 % on purchases. Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from the Jordanian Investment Commission for
the period from June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax charge. The exemption has
been extended to February 5, 2024.
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the Company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred
income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
10
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Income and Sales Taxes (continued)
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that
position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized income
tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than
50 % likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement
are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related
to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
No significant uncertainty in tax positions relating to income taxes were incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021.
Foreign Currency Translation
The reporting currency of the Company is the
U.S. dollar (“US$” or “$”). The Company uses JOD in Jordan companies, HKD in Treasure Success and Ever
Winland, and Chinese Yuan (“CNY”) in Jiangmen Treasure Success as functional currency of each above-mentioned entity.
The assets and liabilities of the Company have been translated into US$ using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date, equity accounts have been translated at historical rates, and revenue and expenses have been translated into US$ using average
exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods.
Therefore, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily
agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Translation adjustments arising from the use of
different exchange rates from period to period are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or
loss. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as incurred, and the balance of
transaction gains and losses were immaterial as of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The value of JOD against US$ and other currencies
may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Jordan’s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation
of JOD, HKD, and CNY may materially affect the Company’s financial condition in terms of US$ reporting. The following table outlines
the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the consolidated financial statements in this report:
December 31,
2022
March 31,
2022
Period-end spot rate
US$1=JOD 0.7090
US$1=JOD 0.7090
US$1=HKD 7.8088
US$1=HKD 7.8325
US$1=CNY 6.8983
US$1=CNY 6.3393
Average rate
US$1=JOD 0.7090
US$1=JOD 0.7090
US$1=HKD 7.8227
US$1=HKD 7.7844
US$1=CNY 7.1111
US$1=CNY 6.4180
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures compensation expense for
stock-based awards based upon the awards’ initial grant-date fair value. The estimated grant-date fair value of the award is recognized
as expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock
options using a Black-Scholes model. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of the grant as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the option, expected risk-free
rates of return, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, and expected dividend yield, each of which is more fully
described below. The assumptions for expected term and expected volatility are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant
date fair value.
●
Expected Term: the expected term of a warrant or a stock option is the period of time that the warrant or a stock option is expected to be outstanding.
●
Risk-free Interest Rate: the Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model on the implied yield at the grant date of the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issued with an equivalent term to the stock-based award being valued. Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with the term for which a zero-coupon interest rate is quoted, the Company uses the nearest interest rate from the available maturities.
●
Expected Stock Price Volatility: the Company utilizes the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the same period of time as the life of the warrant or stock option. When the Company’s own stock volatility information is unavailable for such period of time, the Company utilizes comparable public company volatility.
●
Dividend Yield: Stock-based compensation awards granted prior to November 2018 assumed no dividend yield, while any subsequent stock-based compensation awards will be valued using the anticipated dividend yield.
11
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Earnings per Share
The Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”)
in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”). ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital
structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g.,
convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date,
if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share)
are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS (See “Note 13 – Earnings per Share”).
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components,
net income and other comprehensive income. The foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements
expressed in JOD or HKD or CNY to US$ is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of comprehensive income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 825-10 requires certain disclosures regarding
the fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
●
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
●
Level 2 - Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
The Company considers the recorded value of its
financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash, including restricted cash, accounts receivable, other current assets,
credit facilities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, income tax payables, other payables, and amounts due to a related party to approximate
the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 based upon the short-term nature of these
assets and liabilities. Non-current operating lease liabilities approximate the fair value as they are discounted using the incremental
borrowing rate.
12
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Concentrations and Credit Risk
Credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31,
2022, respectively, $ 8,223,946
and $ 12,735,486
of the Company’s cash was on deposit at financial institutions in Jordan, where
there currently is no rule or regulation requiring such financial institutions to maintain insurance to cover bank deposits in the
event of bank failure. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively, $ 83,589
and $ 351,255
of the Company’s cash
were on deposit at financial institutions in China, respectively. Cash maintained in banks within China of less than CNY
0.5
million
(equivalent to $ 72,482 ) per bank is covered by “deposit insurance regulation” promulgated by the State Council of the
People’s Republic of China. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, $ 17,434,519
and $ 13,311,340
of the Company’s
cash was on deposit at financial institutions in Hong Kong, respectively, which are insured by the Hong Kong Deposit Protection
Board subject to certain limitations. While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it
also continually monitors their creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively, $ 346,393
and $ 37,342
of
the Company’s cash was on deposit in the United States, respectively, and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation up to $ 250,000 .
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and
derived from revenue earned from customers, and therefore are exposed to credit risk. The risk is mitigated by the Company’s assessment
of its customers’ creditworthiness and its ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances.
Customer and vendor concentration risk
The Company’s sales are made primarily in
the United States. Its operating results could be adversely affected by U.S. government policies on importing business, foreign exchange
rate fluctuations, and changes in local market conditions. The Company has a concentration of its revenue and purchases with specific
customers and suppliers. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, four end-customers accounted for
43 %,
20 %,
19 %, and
10 % of the
Company’s total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, two end-customers accounted for
57 % and
18 %
of the Company’s total revenue, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, two end-customers accounted
for
53 % and
27 %, and
68 % and
23 % of the Company’s total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, three end-customers accounted
for
32 %,
31 %, and
10 % of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, one end-customer accounted
for
89 % of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company purchased approximately
28 % of its garments from
one
major supplier. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
purchased approximately
13 % and
10 % of its garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively. For the three and nine months
ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased approximately
53 % and
22 %, and
20 % and
10 % of its garments and raw materials from two major
suppliers, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, accounts payable to the Company’s three major suppliers accounted for
21 %,
12 %,
and
12 % of its total accounts payable balance, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, accounts payable to the Company’s three major
suppliers accounted for
11 %,
11 %, and
10 % of its total accounts payable balance, respectively.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Risks and Uncertainties
The principal operations of the Company are located
in Jordan. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced by political, economic,
and legal environments in Jordan, as well as by the general state of the Jordanian economy. The Company’s operations in Jordan are
subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America. These include risks
associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results
may be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory and social conditions in Jordan. Although the Company has not experienced
losses from these situations and believes that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations, including its organization and
structure disclosed in Note 1, this may not be indicative of future results.
The spread of COVID-19 around the world since
March 2020 has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. However, the sales growth of the Company resumed in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and has extended well into fiscal year 2022. Since fiscal 2022, the Company’s production facilities
resumed full operation with additional medical and hygienic measures in place. The Company does not believe the COVID-19 pandemic had
a significant impact on its operations during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
There is still significant uncertainty around
the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international
economies. The Company currently expects that its operation results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 would not be significantly
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, should there be a resurgence of COVID-19
cases globally and should the U.S. government or the Jordan government implement new restrictions to contain the spread, the Company’s
business would be negatively impacted.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on net income or cash flows as
previously reported.
NOTE 3 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Company considers the applicability and impact
of all accounting standards updates (“ASUs”). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued.
In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU is intended to
improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial
institutions and other organizations. This ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the
reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU requires enhanced
disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating
credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of the Company’s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative
and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. In November

NOTE 7 – LEASES
The Company has
46
operating leases for manufacturing
facilities and offices. Some leases include one or more options to renew, which is typically at the Company’s sole discretion. The
Company regularly evaluates the renewal options, and, when it is reasonably certain of exercise, it will include the renewal period in
its lease term. New lease modifications result in the measurement of the right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liability.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. ROU assets
and related lease obligations are recognized at a commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease
term.
All of the Company’s leases are classified
as operating leases and primarily include office space and manufacturing facilities.
The weighted average remaining lease terms and
discount rates for all of operating leases were as follows as of December 31, 2022:

standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal organizational structure
as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial statements for details on the Company’s
business segments. The Company uses the “management approach” in determining reportable operating segments. The management

decisions and assessing performance as the source for determining the Company’s reportable segments. Management, including the chief
operating decision maker, reviews operation results by the revenue of the Company’s products. The Company’s major product
is outerwear. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, outerwear accounted for approximately
94.1 % and
84.1 % of the Company’s
total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, outerwear accounted for approximately

100 % ownership interest in Jiangmen Treasure Success. As of December 31, 2022, Treasure Success had
made capital contribution of HKD
10
million (approximately $ 1.3
million). Pursuant to the articles of incorporation of Jiangmen
Treasure Success, Treasure Success is required to complete the remaining capital contribution before December 31, 2029 as Treasure
Success’ available funds permit.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is a party to various
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues costs associated with these matters when they become probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company’s
management does not expect any liability from the disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would not
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
NOTE 16 – INCOME TAX
Jerash Garments, Jerash Embroidery, Chinese Garments,
Paramount, Jerash The First, MK Garments, and Kawkab Venue are subject to the regulations of the Income Tax Department in Jordan. In accordance
with the Investment Encouragement Law, Jerash Garments’ export sales to overseas customers were entitled to a 100% income tax exemption
for a period of 10 years commencing on the first day of production. This exemption had been extended for five years until December 31,
2018. Effective January 1, 2019, the Jordanian government reclassified the area where Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are to a Development
Zone. In accordance with the Development Zone law, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries were subject to income tax at income tax rate
of 16% plus a 1% social contribution between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Effective from January 1, 2022, the income tax rate
raised to 18% or 20% plus 1% social contribution.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act imposed tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits (“E&P”)
of foreign subsidiaries (the “Toll Charge”). The Toll Charge is based in part of the amount of E&P held in cash and other
specific assets as of December 31, 2017. The Toll Charge can be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue
interest. Additionally, under the provisions of the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the foreign earnings
of Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. taxation at the Jerash Holdings level under the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed
Income (“GILTI”) regime.
Interim income tax expenses or benefit is recognized
based on the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based upon the tax rate expected for the full fiscal year applied
to the pretax income or loss of the interim period. The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate for the three and nine months
ended December 31, 2022 was
26.7 % and
26.6 %, respectively, and differed from the effective statutory federal income tax rate of
21.0 %,
primarily due to GILTI adjustments, foreign tax rate differentials, and valuation allowance adjustments.
NOTE 17 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Revenue increased by approximately $6.2 million, or 17%, to $43.0 million,
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $36.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly
due to substantial increases in local sales in Jordan and sales to Hong Kong customers that more than offset slight decreases in our two
major U.S. customers.

Since January 2010, all apparel manufactured in
Jordan can be exported to the U.S. without customs duty being imposed, pursuant to the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement entered
into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that allowed us to expand our
garment export business in the U.S.
25
The slight increase of approximately $0.1 million
in sales to the U.S. during the three months ended December 31, 2022, was mainly attributable to the diversification of customer base
in the market with expansion in sales to an existing customer and introduction of a new customer.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
aggregate sales to Hong Kong, Jordan, and other locations, increased by 158% from approximately $3.9 million to $9.9 million from the
same period last year as more domestic orders were received to fill up capacity released from lower demands from U.S. customers.
Cost of goods sold . Following the
increase in sales revenue, our cost of goods sold increased by approximately $7.3 million, or 24%, to approximately $37.2 million, for
the three months ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $29.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of revenue,
the cost of goods sold increased by approximately 6% points to 87% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 81% for the same
period in fiscal 2022. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the higher proportion
of non-U.S. orders that typically generate lower margin.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
we purchased 28%, of our garments from one major supplier. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we purchased 53% and 22% of our
garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively.
Gross profit margin.
Gross profit
margin was approximately 13% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which decreased by 6% points from 19% for the same period in
fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the lower proportion of export orders to the U.S. that typically
generate higher margin.
Operating expenses.
Operating expenses
maintained to approximately $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared for the same period of 2021.
Other expenses, net.
Other expenses,
net was approximately $112,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other expenses, net of approximately $80,000
for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expenses.
Income tax expenses.
Income tax
expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $0.3 million compared to income tax expenses of approximately
$0.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate mainly resulted from the decrease of net loss
in China, offsetting the increase of corporate income tax rate in Jordan from a combined rate of 17% to 19% or 21% since January 1, 2022,
and the increase in valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets related to increased operating losses in our U.S. entities. The
effective tax rate was 26.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 28.0% for the three months ended December 31,
2021.
Net income.
Net income for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.9 million compared to net income of approximately $1.7 million for the same period
in fiscal 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower sales to two of our major export customers.
Nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021

into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that allowed us to expand our
garment export business in the U.S.
The decrease of approximately 7% in sales to the U.S. during the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 was mainly attributable to the decrease in sales to our two major customers in the U.S. due to higher inflation
and general inventory levels.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
aggregate sales to Hong Kong, Jordan, and other locations, increased by 155% from approximately $5.8 million to $14.7 million from the
same period last year as our factories took up more domestic orders to fill up the production capacity released from lower demands from
the U.S.
Cost of goods sold . Following the
increase in sales revenue, our cost of goods sold increased by approximately $5.2 million, or 6%, to approximately $95.0 million for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 from approximately $89.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of revenue, the
cost of goods sold increased by approximately 3% points to 83% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 80% for the same period
in fiscal 2022. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a higher proportion of sales
to domestic and non-U.S. customers that typically generate lower margin.
27
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we
purchased 13% and 10% of our garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31,
2021, we purchased 20% and 10% of our garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively.
Gross profit margin.
Gross profit
margin was approximately 17% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which decreased by 3% points from 20% for the same period in
fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by a lower proportion of export orders to the U.S. that typically
generate higher gross margin.
Operating expenses.
Operating expenses
increased by approximately 6.6% from approximately $12.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, to approximately $13.1 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcounts from the acquisition of MK Garments,
and an increase in expenses in relation to foreign worker travelling expenses for the expansion in total group workforce to 5,600 as of
December 31, 2022.
Other expenses net.
Other expenses,
net was approximately $245,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other expenses, net of approximately $193,000
for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to the increase in net interest expenses.
Income tax expenses.
Income tax
expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.6 million compared to income tax expenses of approximately
$2.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate mainly resulted from the increase of corporate
income tax rate in Jordan from a combined rate of 17% to 19% or 21% since January 1, 2022, and the increase in valuation allowance provided
on deferred tax assets related to increased operating losses in our U.S. entities. The effective tax rate was up to 26.6% for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 20.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Net income.
Net income for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $4.4 million compared to net income of approximately $8.1 million for the same period
in fiscal 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower sales to two of our major export customers.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Jerash Holdings (US), Inc. is a holding company
incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company, we rely on dividends and other distributions from our Jordanian and Hong Kong subsidiaries
to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Current Jordanian regulations permit our Jordanian subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out
of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Jordanian accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our Jordanian
subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve
funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. We have relied on direct payments of expenses by our subsidiaries (which
generate revenue) to meet our obligations to date. To the extent payments are due in U.S. dollars, we have occasionally paid such amounts
in JOD to an entity controlled by our management capable of paying such amounts in U.S. dollars. Such transactions have been made at prevailing
exchange rates and have resulted in immaterial losses or gains on currency exchange but no other profit.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately
$24.6 million and restricted cash of approximately $1.6 million compared to cash of approximately $25.2 million and restricted cash of
approximately $1.4 million as of March 31, 2022. The slight decrease in total cash was mainly a result of the payments of dividends and
investment in capital expenditures in this period.
Our current assets as of December 31, 2022 were
approximately $66.0 million and our current liabilities were approximately $18.9 million, which resulted in a ratio of approximately 3.5
to 1. As of March 31, 2022, our current assets were approximately $69.9 million and our current liabilities were $14.1 million, resulting
in a ratio of 4.9 to 1.
The primary drivers in the decrease in current
assets were the decrease in accounts receivables, inventory, cash for capital investments and dividend payments in this period.
28
The primary driver in the increase in current
liabilities was an increase in outstanding under credit facilities financing the purchases of raw materials for our orders.
Total equity as of December 31, 2022 was approximately
$71.1 million compared to $69.3 million as of March 31, 2022.
We had net working capital of $47.1 million and
$55.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that cash on hand
and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs for the next 12 months from the date
of this Quarterly Report is released.
Since May and October 2021, we have participated
in supply chain financing programs of two of our major customers, respectively. The programs allow us to receive early payments for approved
sales invoices submitted by us through the bank the customer cooperates with. For any early payments received, we are subject to an early
payment charge imposed by the customer’s bank, for which the rate is LIBOR plus a spread. The arrangement allows us to have better
liquidity without the need to incur administrative charges and handling fees as in bank financing.
We have funded our working capital needs from
our operations. Our working capital requirements are influenced by the level of our operations, the numerical and dollar volume of our
sales contracts, the progress of execution on our customer contracts, and the timing of accounts receivable collections.
Credit Facilities
DBSHK Facility Letter
Pursuant to the DBSHK facility letter dated January
12, 2022, DBSHK provided a bank facility of up to $5.0 million to Treasure Success. Pursuant to the agreement, DBSHK agreed to finance
cargo receipt, trust receipt, account payable financing, and certain type of import invoice financing up to an aggregate of $5.0 million.
The DBSHK facility bears interest at 1.5% per annum over Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for HKD bills and 1.3% per annum over DBSHK’s
cost of funds for foreign currency bills. The facility is guaranteed by Jerash Holdings and became available to the Company on June 17,
2022. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.4 million and $nil outstanding under this DBSHK facility, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
by $4.7 million to $9.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $14.6 million for the nine months ended December
31, 2021. It was primarily due to lower net income of $3.6 million, less reduction in inventory of $2.0 million, an increase in advance
to suppliers of $5.9 million, partially offset by more reduction in receivables of $1.8 million, and more increases in payables and accruals
of $4.9 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately $7.1 million in the same period in fiscal 2022. The
net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was mainly used in investment in property, plant, and
machinery including the ongoing construction of a dormitory and factory expansion, and considerations paid to acquire Ever Winland and
Kawkab Venus.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately $1.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, including dividend payments of approximately $1.9 million, payments
for share repurchase of approximately $0.8 million, and settlement to a related party of approximately $0.3 million, offsetting by net
proceeds from short-term loans of approximately $4.4 million. There was a net cash inflow of approximately $3.9 million in the same period
in fiscal 2022, resulting from dividend payments and repayment of short-term loans that were offset by a net proceed of $6.3 million from
an issuance of common stock.
Statutory Reserves
In accordance with the corporate law in Jordan,
our subsidiaries in Jordan are required to make appropriations to certain reserve funds, based on net income determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles of Jordan. Appropriations to the statutory reserve are required to be 10% of net income
until the reserve is equal to 100% of the entity’s share capital. Jiangmen Treasure Success is required to set aside 10% of its
net income as a statutory surplus reserve until such reserve is equal to 50% of its registered capital, in accordance with corporate laws
in China. These reserves are not available for dividend distribution. The statutory reserve was approximately $0.4 million and approximately
$0.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The following table provides the amount of our
statutory reserves, the amount of restricted net assets, consolidated net assets, and the amount of restricted net assets as a percentage
of consolidated net assets, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total restricted net assets accounted for approximately
0.53% of our consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2022. As our subsidiaries in Jordan are only required to set aside 10% of net
profits to fund the statutory reserves, we believe the potential impact of such restricted net assets on our liquidity is limited.

Capital Expenditures
We had capital expenditures of approximately $11.3
million and approximately $5.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, for plant and machinery, the construction
of a dormitory and factory expansion, and the acquisitions of Ever Winland and Kawkab Venus, respectively. For the nine months ended December
31, 2022, payments for additional plant and machinery, construction of a dormitory and factory expansion, the acquisition of Kawkab Venus,
and the acquisition of Ever Winland amounted to approximately $0.5 million, $3.4 million, $2.7 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, payments for additional plant and machinery, and payments to additional properties and leasehold
improvements amounted to approximately $1.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
On August 7, 2019, we completed a
transaction to acquire 12,340 square meters (approximately three acres) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a
third party to construct a dormitory for our employees with aggregate purchase price JOD 863,800 (approximately $1,218,303).
Management has revised the plan to construct both dormitory and production facilities on the land in order to capture the increasing
demand for our capacity. We are conducting engineering design and study on this project and we plan to begin construction after a
thorough and complete assessment of the impact of the current inflation on customer demands.
On February 6, 2020, we completed a
transaction to acquire 4,516 square meters (approximately 48,608 square feet) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from
a third party to construct a dormitory for our employee with aggregate purchase price JOD 313,501 (approximately $442,162). We
expect to spend approximately $8.2 million in capital expenditures to build the dormitory. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
management decided to put on hold the construction project in fiscal 2021 to retain financial resources to support our operations,
and also to wait and see how the global economy and customer demand recover after the outbreak. The preparation work resumed in
early 2021 and construction work commenced in April 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have spent approximately $4.5 million on
construction. The dormitory is expected to be completed and ready for use in fiscal 2024.
On July 14, 2021, we, through our wholly owned
subsidiary Jerash Garments, entered into a Sale and Purchase Contract (the “Kawkab Agreement”) with Kawkab Venus Dowalyah
Lisenaet Albesah (the “Kawkab Seller”). Pursuant to the Kawkab Agreement, the Kawkab Seller agreed to sell, and Jerash Garments
agreed to purchase, 100% of the ownership interests in Kawkab Venus for a consideration of $2.7 million. Kawkab Venus holds land with
factory premises only, which are leased to MK Garments. Kawkab Venus had no other significant assets or liabilities and no operation activities
or employees at the time of acquisition. We completed this acquisition in August 2022.
In January 2022, we commenced a construction project
of an expansion of our own premises in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan. Through December 31, 2022, we had paid approximately JOD
728,000 (approximately $1,027,000) and the entire balance was recorded as construction in progress. The estimated construction cost is
approximately JOD 870,000 (approximately $1.2 million). We expect the project to be completed and ready to use in fiscal 2023.
On June 22, 2022, Treasure Success entered into
a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Wong Bing Lun and Chow Lai Ming (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Sellers
agreed to sell, and Treasure Success agreed to purchase, 100% of the ownership interests and the Sellers’ benefit of the shareholder/director
loans in Ever Winland for a consideration of HKD39.6 million (approximately $5.1 million). Ever Winland holds office premises, which are
leased to Treasure Success. Ever Winland had no other significant assets or liabilities and no operation activities or employees at the
time of acquisition. The acquisition was completed on August 29, 2022.
We project that there will be an aggregate of
approximately $14 million and $3 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, for
further enhancement of production capacity to meet future sales growth. We expect that our capital expenditures will increase in the future
as our business continues to develop and expand. We have used cash generated from operations of our subsidiaries to fund our capital commitments
in the past and anticipate using such funds to fund capital expenditure commitments in the future.
Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
We have not entered into any other financial guarantees
or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts
that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholders’ equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial
statements.
31
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make judgments,
estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and any related disclosures.
We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience
and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component
of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates.
We believe that our accounting policies involve
a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates. Accordingly,
the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations
are summarized in “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
