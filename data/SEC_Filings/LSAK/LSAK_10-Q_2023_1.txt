Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Unaudited Interim Financial Information   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and include all of the information and disclosures required for interim financial reporting. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.   These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, accounting policies and financial notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which are necessary for a fair representation of financial results for the interim periods presented.
References to “Lesaka” are references solely to Lesaka Technologies, Inc. References to the “Company” refer to Lesaka and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.   Recent accounting pronouncements adopted   In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which amends guidance in
Business Combinations (Topic 805)
regarding the recognition and measurement of contract assets and liabilities in a business combination. These items are recognized at fair value on acquisition under current guidance. The new guidance requires an acquiring entity to apply guidance in
Revenue Recognition (Topic 606)
to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The guidance became effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.   Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2022   In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, an entity is required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2023. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements and related disclosures, but does not expect the impact on its financial results to be material.   In November 2019, the FASB issued guidance regarding
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842).
The guidance provides a framework to stagger effective dates for future major accounting standards and amends the effective dates for certain major new accounting standards to give implementation relief to certain types of entities, including Smaller Reporting Companies. The Company is a Smaller Reporting Company. Specifically, the guidance changes some effective dates for certain new standards on the following topics in the FASB Codification, namely Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815); Leases (ASC 842); Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (ASC 326); and Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). The guidance defers the adoption date of guidance regarding
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
by the Company from July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2023. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements and related disclosures, but does not expect the impact on its financial results to be material. 8   2.

million provided to Carbon was scheduled to be repaid before June 30, 2020, however, Carbon requested a payment holiday as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. The parties had not agreed to new repayment terms as of June 30, 2022. In June 2021, the Company determined to create an allowance for doubtful loans receivable of $ 3.0
million due to these circumstances and the ongoing operating losses incurred by Carbon. The loan was sold in September 2022 for $ 0.75
million (refer to Note 5).   Investment in

(1) Represents reallocation of a portion of the Merchant allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable as of June 30, 2022, which was included in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of June 30, 2022.   Total finance loans receivable, net, comprises microlending finance loans receivable related to the Company’s microlending operations in South Africa as well as its merchant finance loans receivable related to Connect’s lending activities in South Africa. Certain merchant finance loans receivable have been pledged as security for the Company’s revolving credit facility (refer to Note 8).   3. Inventory   The Company’s inventory comprised the following categories as of
December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022 :       December 31,     June 30,         2022     2022                     Raw materials $ 2,393   $ 2,446     Work-in-progress   148     147     Finished goods   31,564     31,633       $ 34,105   $ 34,226   As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, finished goods includes $ 10.1
million and $ 13.7
million, respectively, of Cell C airtime inventory that was previously classified as finished goods subject to sale restrictions. In support of Cell C’s liquidity position and pursuant to Cell C’s recapitalization process, the Company limited the resale of this airtime to its own distribution channels. On September 30, 2022, Cell C concluded its recapitalization process and the Company and Cell C entered into an agreement under which Cell C agreed to repurchase, from October 2023, up to ZAR
10
million of Cell C inventory from the Company per month. The amount to be repurchased by Cell C will be calculated as ZAR
10
million less the face value of any sales made by the Company during that month. The Company continued to sell a minimum amount of Cell C airtime through its internal channels in late fiscal 2022/ early fiscal 2023 in support of Cell C’s liquidity position. However, its ability to sell this airtime has increased significantly since the acquisition of Connect because Connect is a significant reseller of Cell C airtime. As a result, and depending on prevailing conditions in the airtime market, the Company has sold higher volumes of airtime through this channel than it did prior to the Cell C recapitalization. If the Company is able to sell at least ZAR
10
million a month through this channel from October 1, 2023, then Cell C would not be required to repurchase any airtime from the Company during any specific month. The Company has agreed to notify Cell C prior to selling any of this airtime, however, there is no restriction placed on the Company on the sale of the airtime. 10   4.
Fair value of financial instruments   Initial recognition and measurement   Financial instruments are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the transaction. Initial measurements are at cost, which includes transaction costs.
Risk management   The Company manages its exposure to currency exchange, translation, interest rate, credit, microlending credit and equity price and liquidity risks as discussed below.
Currency exchange risk   The Company is subject to currency exchange risk because it purchases components for safe assets, that the Company assembles, and inventories that it is required to settle in other currencies, primarily the euro, renminbi, and U.S. dollar. The Company has used forward contracts in order to limit its exposure in these transactions to fluctuations in exchange rates between the South African rand (“ZAR”), on the one hand, and the U.S. dollar and the euro, on the other hand.   Translation risk   Translation risk relates to the risk that the Company’s results of operations will vary significantly as the U.S. dollar is its reporting currency, but it earns a significant amount of its revenues and incurs a significant amount of its expenses in ZAR. The U.S. dollar to the ZAR exchange rate has fluctuated significantly over the past three years. As exchange rates are outside the Company’s control, there can be no assurance that future fluctuations will not adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.   Interest rate risk   As a result of its normal borrowing activities, the Company’s operating results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which it manages primarily through regular financing activities. Interest rates in South Africa are trending upwards and the Company expects higher interest rates in the foreseeable future which will increase its cost of borrowing. The Company periodically evaluates the cost and effectiveness of interest rate hedging strategies to manage this risk. The Company generally maintains surplus cash in cash equivalents and held to maturity investments and has occasionally invested in marketable securities.   Credit risk   Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties. The Company maintains credit risk policies in respect of its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of a potential counterparty’s financial condition, credit rating, and other credit criteria and risk mitigation tools as the Company’s management deems appropriate. With respect to credit risk on financial instruments, the Company maintains a policy of entering into such transactions only with South African and European financial institutions that have a credit rating of “B” (or its equivalent) or better, as determined by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings.   Consumer microlending credit risk   The Company is exposed to credit risk in its Consumer microlending activities, which provides unsecured short-term loans to qualifying customers. Credit bureau checks as well as an affordability test are conducted as part of the origination process, both of which being in line with local regulations. The Company considers this policy to be appropriate because the affordability test it performs takes into account a variety of factors such as other debts and total expenditures on normal household and lifestyle expenses. Additional allowances may be required should the ability of its customers to make payments when due deteriorate in the future. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these finance loan receivables, including ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.   Merchant lending   The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable related to its Merchant services segment with respect to short-term loans to qualifying merchant customers. The Company’s risk management procedures include adhering to its proprietary lending criteria which uses an online-system loan application process, obtaining necessary customer transaction-history data and credit bureau checks. The Company considers these procedures to be appropriate because it takes into account a variety of factors such as the customer’s credit capacity and customer-specific risk factors when originating a loan. 11   4.
Fair value of financial instruments (continued)   Risk management (continued   Equity price and liquidity risk   Equity price risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of the volatility in the exchange-traded price of equity securities that it holds. The market price of these securities may fluctuate for a variety of reasons and, consequently, the amount that the Company may obtain in a subsequent sale of these securities may significantly differ from the reported market value.
Equity liquidity risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of the lack of liquidity on the exchange on which those securities are listed. The Company may not be able to sell some or all of these securities at one time, or over an extended period of time without influencing the exchange-traded price, or at all.   Financial instruments   The following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure its significant financial assets and liabilities at fair value.   In general, and where applicable, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology would apply to Level 1 investments. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. These investments would be included in Level 2 investments. In circumstances in which inputs are generally unobservable, values typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. Investments valued using such techniques are included in Level 3 investments.   Asset measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs – investment in Cell C   The Company’s Level 3 asset represents an investment of
75,000,000
class “A” shares in Cell C, a significant mobile telecoms provider in South Africa. The Company used a discounted cash flow model developed by the Company to determine the fair value of its investment in Cell C as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and valued Cell C at $ 0.0
(zero) and $ 0.0
(zero) as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company incorporates the payments under Cell C’s lease liabilities into the cash flow forecasts and assumes that Cell C’s deferred tax assets would be utilized over the forecast period. The Company has increased the marketability discount from
10 % to
20 % and the minority discount from
15 % to
30 % due to the reduction in our shareholding percentage from
15 % to
5 % as well as current market conditions. The Company utilized the latest revised business plan provided by Cell C management for the period ended December 31, 2025, for the December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022 valuations. Adjustments have been made to the WACC rate to reflect the Company’s assessment of risk to Cell C achieving its business plan.   The following key valuation inputs were used as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:   Weighted Average Cost of Capital ("WACC"): Between
20 % and
31 % over the period of the forecast   Long term growth rate: 3 % ( 3 % as of June 30, 2022)   Marketability discount: 20 % ( 10 % as of June 30, 2022)   Minority discount: 30 % ( 15 % as of June 30, 2022)   Net adjusted external debt - December 31, 2022: (1) ZAR
6.9
billion ($ 0.4
billion), no lease liabilities included   Net adjusted external debt - June 30, 2022: (2) ZAR

(2) translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2022.   The following table presents the impact on the carrying value of the Company’s Cell C investment of a 1.0% increase and 1.0% decrease in the WACC rate and the EBITDA margins respectively used in the Cell C valuation on December 31, 2022, all amounts translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022:   Sensitivity for fair value of Cell C investment   1.0% increase   1.0% decrease     WACC rate $ - $ 390     EBITDA margin $ 992 $ -     The fair value of the Cell C shares as of December 31, 2022, represented
0 % of the Company’s total assets, including these shares. The Company expects to hold these shares for an extended period of time and that there will be short-term equity price volatility with respect to these shares particularly given that Cell C remains in a turnaround process. 12   4.
Fair value of financial instruments (continued)   Financial instruments (continued)   Derivative transactions - Foreign exchange contracts     As part of the Company’s risk management strategy, the Company enters into derivative transactions to mitigate exposures to foreign currencies using foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts are over-the-counter derivative transactions. Substantially all of the Company’s derivative exposures are with counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of “B” (or equivalent) or better. The Company uses quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities to determine fair value (Level 2). The Company has no derivatives that require fair value measurement under Level 1 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:   Notional amount ('000) Strike price Fair market Maturity EUR 375.1 ZAR 18.0002 ZAR 18.1676 January 31, 2023 USD 238.8 ZAR 17.1676 ZAR 17.0172 January 31, 2023   The Company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of June 30, 2022.   Derivative transactions – Fiscal 2022 foreign exchange option contracts   The Company held a significant amount of U.S. dollars in early fiscal 2022 and intended to use a portion of these funds to settle part of the purchase consideration related to the Connect acquisition. The purchase consideration was expected to be settled in ZAR. Accordingly, the Company entered into foreign exchange option contracts with FirstRand Bank Limited acting through its Rand Merchant Bank division (“RMB”) in November 2021 in order to manage the risk of currency volatility and to fix the ZAR amount to be utilized for part of the purchase consideration settlement. These foreign exchange option contracts, also known as synthetic forwards, were over-the-counter derivative transactions (Level 2). RMB’s long-term credit rating is “BB”. The Company used quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities to determine fair value of the foreign exchange option contracts (Level 2).
The Company marked-to-market the synthetic forwards as of December 31, 2021, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which determined the respective fair value of the options utilizing appropriate market parameters, and recorded an unrealized loss of $ 2.4
million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. The unrealized loss is included in the caption unrealized loss related to fair value adjustment to currency options in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. These currency options matured on February 24, 2022.   The following table presents the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022, according to the fair value hierarchy:               Quoted Price in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)     Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)     Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)     Total                         Assets                             Investment in Cell C $ -   $ -   $ -   $ -       Related to insurance business:

The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and the excess is determined to be other-than-temporary. Refer to Note 5 for impairment charges recorded during the reporting periods presented herein. The Company has
no
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 14   5. Equity-accounted investments and other long-term assets   Refer to Note 9 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, for additional information regarding its equity-accounted investments and other long-term assets.   Equity-accounted investments   The Company’s ownership percentage in its equity-accounted investments as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, was as follows:                               December 31,   June 30,                               2022   2022     Finbond Group Limited (“Finbond”)   28.4 %   29.3 %     Sandulela Technology (Pty) Ltd ("Sandulela")   49.0 %   49.0 %     Carbon Tech Limited (“Carbon”)   - %   25.0 %     SmartSwitch Namibia (Pty) Ltd (“SmartSwitch Namibia”)   50.0 %   50.0 %     Finbond   As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned
238,518,312
shares in Finbond representing approximately
28.4 % of its issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Finbond is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) and its closing price on December 30, 2022, the last trading day of the month, was ZAR
0.49
per share. The market value, using the December 30, 2022, closing price, of the Company’s holding in Finbond on December 31, 2022, was ZAR
116.9
million ($ 6.9
million translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022).   The Company sold
7,379,656
and
7,461,591
shares in Finbond for cash during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and recorded a loss of $ 0.112
million and $ 0.114
million, which is included in the caption net gain on disposal of equity-accounted investments in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.   The following table presents the calculation of the loss on disposal of Finbond shares during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022:               Three months ended December 31,   Six months ended December 31,     2022   2022   Loss on disposal of Finbond shares:             Consideration received in cash $ 138   $ 141   Less: carrying value of Finbond shares sold   ( 157 )     ( 160 )   Less: release of foreign currency translation reserve from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 97 )     ( 99 )   Add: release of stock-based compensation charge related to equity-accounted investment   4     4     Loss on sale of Finbond shares $ ( 112 )   $ ( 114 )     The Company did not identify any impairment indicators as of December 31, 2022. The Company considered the combination of the ongoing losses incurred and reported by Finbond and its lower share price as impairment indicators as of September 30, 2022. The Company performed an impairment assessment of its holding in Finbond as of September 30, 2022. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 1.1
million during the six months ended December 31, 2022, related to the other-than-temporary decrease in Finbond’s value, which represented the difference between the determined fair value of the Company’s interest in Finbond and the Company’s carrying value (before the impairment). There continues to be limited trading in Finbond shares on the JSE because a small number of shareholders own approximately
80 % of its issued and outstanding shares between them. The Company calculated a fair value per share for Finbond by applying a liquidity discount of
25 % to the September 30, 2022, Finbond closing price of ZAR
0.49 . The Company increased the liquidity discount from
15 % (used in the previous impairment assessment) to
25 % (used in the September 30, 2022 assessment) as a result of the ongoing limited trading activity observed on the JSE. 15   5. Equity-accounted investments and other long-term assets (continued)   Equity-accounted investments (continued)   Carbon   In September 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Net1 Applied Technologies Netherlands B.V. (“Net1 BV”), entered into a binding term sheet with the Etobicoke Limited (“Etobicoke”) to sell its entire interest, or
25 %, in Carbon to Etobicoke for $ 0.5
million and a loan due from Carbon, with a face value of $ 3
million, to Etobicoke for $ 0.75
million. Both the equity interest and the loan had a carrying value of $ 0
(nil) at June 30, 2022. The parties have agreed that Etobicoke pledge the Carbon shares purchased as security for the amounts outstanding under the binding term sheet.
The Company received $ 0.25
million on closing and the outstanding balance due by Etobicoke is expected to be paid as follows: (i) $ 0.25
million on September 30, 2023, which is included in the caption accounts receivable, net and other receivables in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and (ii) the remaining amount, of $ 0.75
million in March 2024, which is included in the caption other long-term assets, including reinsurance assets in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The Company has allocated the $ 0.25
million received to the sale of the equity interest and will allocate the funds received first to the sale of the equity interest and then to the loans.   The Company currently believes that the fair value of the Carbon shares provided as security is $ 0
(nil), which is in line with the carrying value as of June 30, 2022, and has created an allowance for doubtful loans receivable related to the $ 1.0
million due from Etobicoke. The Company did not incur any significant transaction costs. The Company has included the gain of $ 0.25
million related to the sale of the Carbon equity interest in the caption net gain on disposal of equity-accounted investments in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.   The following table presents the calculation of the gain on disposal of Carbon in September 2022:               Three months ended September 30,     2022   Gain on disposal of Carbon shares:       Consideration received in cash in September 2022 $ 250   Less: carrying value of Carbon   -     Gain on disposal of Carbon shares: (1) $ 250   (1) The Company does not expect to pay taxes related to the sale of Carbon because the base cost of its investment exceeds the sales consideration received. The Company does not believe that it will be able to utilize the loss generated because Net1 BV does not generate taxable income. 16   5.

Stock-based compensation (continued)   Stock option and restricted stock activity (continued)   Restricted stock (continued)   Grants   In July 2022 and December 2022, the Company awarded
32,582
and , 430399
shares of restricted stock, respectively, to employees and an executive officer which have time -based vesting conditions. In December 2022, the Company awarded
257,868
shares of restricted stock to executive officers which contained time and performance-based (market conditions related to share price performance) vesting conditions. The Company also agreed to match, on a
one -for-one basis, (1) an employee’s purchase of up to $ 1.0
million worth of the Company’s shares of common stock in open market purchases, and in August 2022, the Company granted
179,498
shares of restricted stock to the employee, and (2) another employee’s purchase of up to
150,000
shares of the Company’s common stock, and in November 2022, the Company granted
150,000
shares of restricted stock to the employee. These shares of restricted stock contain time-based vesting conditions. The Company awarded
300,000
shares to an executive officer on December 31, 2022, which vested on the date of the award.   The
257,868
shares of restricted stock awarded to executive officers are subject to a time-based vesting condition and a market condition and vest in full only on the date, if any, that the following conditions are satisfied: (1) a compounded annual
10 % appreciation in the Company’s stock price off a base price of $ 4.94
over the measurement period commencing on December 1, 2022 through December 1, 2025, and (2) the recipient is employed by the Company on a full-time basis when the condition in (1) is met. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, then none of the shares of restricted stock will vest and they will be forfeited. The Company’s closing price on December 1, 2022, was $ 4.08 .   The appreciation levels (times and price) and vesting percentages as of each period ended are as follows: 
Prior to the first anniversary of the grant date:
0 %; 
Fiscal 2024, stock price as of December 1, 2023 is
1.1
times higher (i.e. $ 5.43
or higher) than $ 4.94 :
33 %; 
Fiscal 2025, stock price as of December 1, 2024 is
1.21
times higher (i.e. $ 5.97
or higher) than $ 4.94 :
67 %; 
Fiscal 2026, stock price as of December 1, 2025 is
1.331
times higher (i.e. $ 6.57 ) than $ 4.94 : 100
%.   The fair value of these shares of restricted stock was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
In scenarios where the shares do not vest, the final vested value at maturity is zero. In scenarios where vesting occurs, the final vested value on maturity is the share price on vesting date. In its calculation of the fair value of the restricted stock, the Company used an equally weighted volatility of
50.1 % for the closing price (of $ 4.08 ), a discounting based on U.S. dollar overnight indexed swap rates for the grant date, and no future dividends. The equally weighted volatility was extracted from the time series for closing prices as the standard deviation of log prices for the three years preceding the grant date.
On July 1, 2021, the Company granted its Group Chief Executive Officer,
117,304
shares of restricted stock, which are subject to time-based vesting conditions and vest in full on June 30, 2024, subject to Mr. Meyer’s continued service to the Company through June 30, 2024. Mr. Meyer was also awarded
117,304
shares of restricted stock which include performance-based conditions and which only vest on June 30, 2024 if the performance conditions are met and Mr. Meyer remains employed with the Company through June 30, 2024. Vesting of half of these awards, or
58,652
shares of restricted stock, is subject to the Company achieving its
three-year
financial services plan during the specific measurement period from June 30, 2021, to June 30, 2024, and the other half is subject to share price growth targets, and only vest if the Company’s share price is $ 8.14
or higher on June 30, 2024. In August 2021, the Company awarded
44,986
shares of restricted stock to an employee which contained time and performance-based (market conditions related to share price performance) vesting conditions.   In August 2021 and December 2021, the Company awarded
44,986
and
50,300
shares of restricted stock, respectively, to employees which have time and performance-based (market conditions related to share price performance) vesting conditions.   Upon joining the Company, each of Messrs. Chris G.B. Meyer and Lincoln C. Mali, were entitled to receive an award of shares of restricted stock which were subject to them purchasing an agreed value of shares (“matching awards”) in the market during a prescribed period of time. The executives acquired shares during November and December 2021, and the Company granted the executives
326,158
matching awards and
71,647
top up awards. The shares vest ratably over
three years
on the applicable vesting date based on the anniversary of each executive’s date of joining the Company.   As fully described in Note 17 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company granted a further
12,962
and
32,405
shares to an advisor during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, which were ineligible for transfer until the earlier of December 31, 2022, or the occurrence of the agreed event. 28   12. Stock-based compensation (continued)   Stock option and restricted stock activity (continued)   Restricted stock (continued)   Vesting   In July 2022,
78,801
shares of restricted stock granted to Mr. Meyer vested and he elected for
35,460
shares to be withheld to satisfy the withholding tax liability on the vesting of these shares. In November and December 2022, an aggregate of
66,893
shares of restricted stock granted to employees vested and they elected for
30,102
shares to be withheld to satisfy the withholding tax liability on the vesting of these shares. These
65,562
( 35,460
plus
30,102 ) shares have been included in our treasury shares.   Except as discussed above,
no
shares of restricted stock vested during the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021,
30,000
shares of restricted stock were forfeited by an executive officer as the market condition (related to share price performance) was not achieved.   Stock-based compensation charge and unrecognized compensation cost   The Company recorded a stock-based compensation charge, net during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, of $ 2.9
million and $ 0.8
million, respectively, which comprised:               Total charge
Allocated to cost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support   Allocated to selling, general and administration     Three months ended December 31, 2022                           Stock-based compensation charge

million respectively, which comprised:   a           Total charge
Allocated to cost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support   Allocated to selling, general and administration     Six months ended December 31, 2022                           Stock-based compensation charge

29   12. Stock-based compensation (continued)   As of December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately $ 0.3
million, which the Company expects to recognize over approximately
two years . As of December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was approximately $ 11.5
million, which the Company expects to recognize over approximately
three years .   As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 0.5
million and $ 0.3
million, related to the stock-based compensation charge recognized related to employees of Lesaka. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $ 0.5
million and $ 0.3
million, related to the deferred tax asset because it does not believe that the stock-based compensation deduction would be utilized as it does not anticipate generating sufficient taxable income in the United States. The Company deducts the difference between the market value on the date of exercise by the option recipient and the exercise price from income subject to taxation in the United States.   13. (Loss) Earnings per share   The Company has issued redeemable common stock which is redeemable at an amount other than fair value. Redemption of
a class of common stock at other than fair value increases or decreases the carrying amount of the redeemable common stock and is reflected in basic earnings per share using the two-class method. There were
no
redemptions of common stock, or adjustments to the carrying value of the redeemable common stock during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, the two-class method presented below does not include the impact of any redemption.
The Company’s redeemable common stock is described in Note 14 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Basic (loss) earnings per share includes shares of restricted stock that meet the definition of a participating security because these shares are eligible to receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stock. Basic (loss) earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method and basic (loss) earnings per share for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , reflects only undistributed earnings. The computation below of basic (loss) earnings per share excludes the net loss attributable to shares of unvested restricted stock (participating non-vested restricted stock) from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of these unvested shares of restricted stock from the denominator.   Diluted (loss) earnings per share has been calculated to give effect to the number of shares of additional common stock that would have been outstanding if the potential dilutive instruments had been issued in each period. Stock options are included in the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method and are not considered to be participating securities, as the stock options do not contain non-forfeitable dividend rights. The Company has excluded employee stock options to purchase
76,572
and
143,551
shares of common stock from the calculation of diluted loss per share during the
six months ended December 31, 2022 , because the effect would be antidilutive.   The calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of a portion of the restricted stock granted to employees as these shares of restricted stock are considered contingently returnable shares for the purposes of the diluted (loss) earnings per share calculation and the vesting conditions in respect of a portion of the restricted stock had been satisfied. The vesting conditions for all awards made are discussed in Note 17 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. 30   13.

per share were outstanding during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company’s common stock. Options to purchase
270,832
shares of the Company’s common stock at prices ranging from $ 6.20
to $ 11.23
per share were outstanding during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company’s common stock. The options, which expire at various dates through February 3, 2032, were still outstanding as of December 31, 2022.   14.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash also includes cash in certain bank accounts that has been ceded to Nedbank. As this cash has been pledged and ceded it may not be drawn and is considered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash as well. Refer to

Leases   The Company has entered into leasing arrangements classified as operating leases under accounting guidance. These leasing arrangements relate primarily to the lease of its corporate head office, administration offices and branch locations through which the Company operates its financial services business in South Africa. The Company’s operating leases have remaining lease terms of between
one
and
five years . The Company also operates parts of its financial services business from locations which it leases for a period of less than one year. The Company’s operating lease expense during each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 0.8
million, respectively. The Company’s operating lease expense during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.6
million and $ 1.8
million, respectively.
The Company does not have any significant leases that have not commenced as of
December 31, 2022 .   The Company has also entered into short-term leasing arrangements, primarily for the lease of branch locations and other locations, to operate its financial services business in South Africa. The Company’s short-term lease expense during the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , was $
0.9
million and $
1.3
million, respectively. The Company’s short-term lease expense during the
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , was $
2.0
million and $
2.6
million, respectively.   The following table presents supplemental balance sheet disclosure related to the Company’s right-of-use assets and its operating lease liabilities as of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 :           December 31,   June 30,           2022   2022       Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:                   Weighted average remaining lease term (years)     2.77     2.14       Weighted average discount rate (percent)     9.3     9.3     The maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022, are presented below:       Maturities of operating lease liabilities           Year ended June 30,           2023 (excluding six months to December 31, 2022)   $ 1,428     2024     2,058     2025     1,207     2026     944     2027     961     Thereafter     849     Total undiscounted operating lease liabilities     7,447     Less imputed interest     1,253     Total operating lease liabilities, included in     6,194     Operating lease liability - current     2,078     Operating lease liability - long-term   $ 4,116 34   17. Operating segments   Operating segments   The Company discloses segment information as reflected in the management information systems reports that its chief operating decision maker uses in making decisions and to report certain entity-wide disclosures about products and services, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets or reports material revenues. A description of the Company’s operating segments is contained in Note 21 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.   Reallocation of certain activities in Other to Merchant   During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, certain processing activities performed outside South Africa which were within our Other operating segment commenced reporting to management within our Merchant operating segment as part of the integration of Connect. The Company has allocated these operations from its Other reporting segment to Merchant in its reportable segments during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Previously reported information has been restated.   The reconciliation of the reportable segment’s revenue to revenue from external customers for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:               Revenue             Reportable Segment     Inter-segment     From external customers                               Consumer $ 15,434   $ -   $ 15,434   Merchant   120,634     -     120,634     Total for the three months ended December 31, 2022 $ 136,068   $ -   $ 136,068                               Consumer $ 16,639   $ -   $ 16,639   Merchant   14,475     -     14,475       Total for the three months ended December 31, 2021 $ 31,114   $ -   $ 31,114   The reconciliation of the reportable segment’s revenue to revenue from external customers for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:               Revenue             Reportable Segment     Inter-segment     From external customers                               Consumer $ 30,438   $ -   $ 30,438   Merchant   230,416     -     230,416     Total for the six months ended December 31, 2022 $ 260,854   $ -   $ 260,854                               Consumer $ 33,803   $ -   $ 33,803   Merchant   31,815     -     31,815       Total for the six months ended December 31, 2021 $ 65,618   $ -   $ 65,618     The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted for items mentioned in the next sentence (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). The Company does not allocate once-off items, stock-based compensation charges, certain lease charges (“Lease adjustments”), depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, other items (including gains or losses on disposal of investments, fair value adjustments to equity securities, fair value adjustments to currency options), interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or loss from equity-accounted investments to its reportable segments. Group costs generally include: employee related costs in relation to employees specifically hired for group roles and related directly to managing the US-listed entity; expenditures related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; non-employee directors’ fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit fees; and directors and officer’s insurance premiums. Once-off items represents non-recurring expense items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The Lease adjustments reflect lease charges and the Stock-based compensation adjustments reflect stock-based compensation expense and are both excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and are therefore reported as reconciling items to reconcile the reportable segments’ Segment Adjusted EBITDA to the Company’s loss before income tax expense. 35   17. Operating segments (continued)   Operating segments (continued)   The reconciliation of the reportable segments measure of profit or loss to loss before income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:               Three months ended     Six months ended           December 31,     December 31,         2022   2021   2022   2021   Reportable segments measure of profit or loss

$ 3,992   $ 189   $ 8,493   $ 887   The segment information as reviewed by the chief operating decision maker does not include a measure of segment assets per segment as all of the significant assets are used in the operations of all, rather than any one, of the segments. The Company does not have dedicated assets assigned to a particular operating segment. Accordingly, it is not meaningful to attempt an arbitrary allocation and segment asset allocation is therefore not presented.   18. Income tax   Income tax in interim periods   For the purposes of interim financial reporting, the Company determines the appropriate income tax provision by first applying the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year to ordinary income. This amount is then adjusted for the tax effect of significant unusual items, for instance, changes in tax law, valuation allowances and non-deductible transaction-related expenses that are reported separately, and have an impact on the tax charge. The cumulative effect of any change in the enacted tax rate, if and when applicable, on the opening balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is also included in the tax charge as a discrete event in the interim period in which the enactment date occurs.   The South African corporate income tax rate was expected to reduce from
28 % to
27 % from July 1, 2022. The change in the income tax rate has not been enacted as of December 31, 2022, and accordingly all deferred taxes assets and liabilities related to the Company’s South African operations are still recorded using the enacted corporate income tax rate of
28 %. 37   18. Income tax (continued)   Income tax in interim periods (continued)   For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s effective tax rate was impacted by the tax expense recorded by the Company’s profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of the Company’s South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.   For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s effective tax rate was impacted by the tax effect of the tax expense recorded by the Company’s profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of the Company’s South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities (including the unrealized loss on the foreign currency options (refer to Note 4)).   Uncertain tax positions   The Company had
no
significant uncertain tax positions during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and therefore, the Company had
no
accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions on its balance sheet. The Company does
no t expect changes related to its unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position in the next 12 months.   The Company has
no
unrecognized tax benefits. The Company files income tax returns mainly in South Africa, Germany, Hong Kong, India, the United Kingdom, Botswana and in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s South African subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax examination by the South African Revenue Service for periods before June 30, 2018. The Company is subject to income tax in other jurisdictions outside South Africa, none of which are individually material to its financial position, statement of cash flows, or results of operations.   19. Commitments and contingencies   Guarantees   The South African Revenue Service and certain of the Company’s customers, suppliers and other business partners have asked the Company to provide them with guarantees, including standby letters of credit, issued by South African banks. The Company is required to procure these guarantees for these third parties to operate its business   RMB has issued guarantees to these third parties amounting to ZAR
33.1
million ($ 1.9
million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022) thereby utilizing part of the Company’s short-term facilities. The Company pays commission of between
3.42 % per annum to
3.44 % per annum of the face value of these guarantees and does not recover any of the commission from third parties.   Nedbank has issued guarantees to these third parties amounting to ZAR
2.1
million ($ 0.1
million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022) thereby utilizing part of the Company’s short-term facilities. The Company pays commission of between
0.4 % per annum to
1.82 % per annum of the face value of these guarantees and does not recover any of the commission from third parties.   The Company has not recognized any obligation related to these guarantees in its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The maximum potential amount that the Company could pay under these guarantees is ZAR
35.2
million ($ 2.1
million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022). As discussed in Note 8, the Company has ceded and pledged certain bank accounts to Nedbank as security for the guarantees issued by them with an aggregate value of ZAR
3.0
million ($ 0.2
million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022). The guarantees have reduced the amount available under its indirect and derivative facilities in the Company’s short-term credit facilities described in Note 8.   Contingencies   The Company is subject to a variety of insignificant claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Management currently believes that the resolution of these other matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 38   Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Form 10-Q.   Forward-looking statements   Some of the statements in this Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments
This quarter represents a significant milestone for Lesaka. We made significant progress in our turnaround strategy, a process that commenced in earnest at the beginning of fiscal 2022. This quarter demonstrates successful execution against a carefully considered transformation strategy.   Key highlights in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 include: 
outperformance of the Merchant business ahead of our expectations and guidance reported, delivering a segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 160 million for the period; 
turn around in the Consumer business, returning it to profitability with segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR10 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to a ZAR 67 million loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2022; and

the group achieving adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 130 million, exceeding the upper end of our guidance of ZAR 123 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with an adjusted EBITDA loss of ZAR 84 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Merchant business outperformance   Our Merchant business has been transformed by the successful conclusion of the Connect acquisition.
The Merchant business has shown strong growth across all the products but particularly in its card acquiring and credit businesses, in particular Capital Connect and Kazang Pay advance. The integration of the Connect Group continues to create new opportunities within our micro small and medium enterprises (“MSME”) offering and is a business that is supported by growth drivers and secular trends underpinning financial inclusion, cash management and digitization for MSME’s.
Our Merchant offering continues to grow: 
In the Value-Added-Service (“VAS”) and supplier payments business, Kazang and EasyPay have seen strong adoption by MSME’s in the informal sector, with a 47% year-on-year growth in the number of devices deployed. We had approximately 64,400 POS devices in field as of December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 57,000 as of September 30, 2022, and approximately 44,000 POS devices a year ago; 
Our automated cash management and payments business, Cash Connect, effectively puts the “bank” in approximately 4,300 merchants’ stores (compared to approximately 3,900 merchants’ stores a year ago). Cash Connect is a provider of robust cash vaults in the formal sector, and is expanding rapidly in the informal sector. This has provided significant operational and risk benefits for our informal merchant customer base; 
In the card acquiring business, card-enabled POS devices increased to approximately 34,500 as of December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 17,100 a year ago, and approximately 27,800 as of September 30, 2022. Kazang Pay, which is our card acquiring offering to the informal sector, has been the primary driver of this growth in devices deployed, where we are seeing rapid adoption of card payments in the informal sector. As a result, our card acquiring business has recorded in excess of 100% growth in devices deployed compared to a year ago; and 39   
We provide merchants quick access to credit through Capital Connect. We continue to see strong demand for this credit offering, disbursed over ZAR 262 million during the quarter, compared to ZAR 154 million in the comparable period ended December 2021.
Consumer business achieves profitability and is well positioned for growth   We have achieved our goal of returning our Consumer segment to profitability at a segment adjusted EBITDA level. Over the past four quarters, we have consistently referenced the three levers underpinning our strategy of returning the consumer business to profitability – cost optimization, increasing average revenue per user (“ARPU”) through cross-selling and growing active EPE account numbers.   This result achieved was primarily through the first two levers. The first is cost savings through the optimization of our distribution network, including the rationalization of infrastructure, rebalancing and investing in our staff complement, as well as improving processes around client onboarding and service.
The progress on our three key initiatives to drive the turnaround is as follows:   
Progress on cost optimization o
Improved profitability in the Consumer business was predominantly driven by realized cost savings following the implementation of our Project Spring initiative just less than a year ago. Under this initiative we decommissioned approximately 800 underperforming ATMs and sold 400 mobile ATMs, leaving us with approximately 800 operating ATMs. Our ATM optimization program has been assisted by the retailer partnership strategy we implemented, which has resulted in a placement of more ATMs out of our branches infrastructure and into retailers. This has produced greater foot traffic, reduced security costs and extended operating hours of our ATMs. We've also deployed almost 40 through-the-wall ATMs. These ATMs are optimally positioned within the retailer stores or shopping malls resulting in longer operating hours and higher consumer utilization. Despite the reduction in overall number of ATMs within our estate, we have experienced an increase in the number of transactions per ATM. Additionally, we have also closed over 100 unprofitable retail branches and sold 200 vehicles.   
Driving customer acquisition ○
Our total active EasyPay Everywhere (“EPE”) transactional account base stood at approximately 1.3 million at the end of December 31, 2022, of which just over 1.1 million (or approximately 85%) are permanent grant recipients. For the first time we are separately reporting the temporary SRD customer base. This is because we offer a more limited service to our SRD grant recipient customer base. As at the end of December 2022, we increased our permanent grant account base by 4% on a net basis compared to a year ago. The net growth of our permanent grant recipient base has been slower than anticipated as we continue to transition the business into a sales driven, customer-centric, financial services provider. ○
Our priority is to grow our permanent grant recipient customer base, where we can build deeper relationships by offering other products such as insurance and lending. We do not offer the same breadth of service to the SRD grant base due to the more temporary nature of the grant. ○
We continue to focus our efforts in the Consumer business on implementing initiatives to improve account activation and utilization.

Progress on cross selling   EasyPay loans (previously referred to as Moneyline)   o
We issued approximately 225,000 loans in the quarter compared to approximately 198,000 in the previous quarter (first quarter of fiscal 2023) evidencing improved loan conversion rates following the implementation of more targeted loan campaigns during the quarter. The portfolio loss ratio, calculated as the loans written off during the period as a percentage of the total loan book, remains encouragingly low at around 1.00% for the quarter (i.e., approximately 4% per annum).
EasyPay insurance (previously referred to as SmartLife)
o
Our insurance product sales continue to grow and provides an important growth opportunity for our cross-selling strategy, with penetration higher, now around 27%, of the active permanent grant account base as of December 31, 2022. Over 29,000 new standalone policies were initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, growing the total number of active policies to approximately 294,000.
ARPU for our permanent client base has increased to ZAR 75 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from ZAR 71 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
40   Strengthening our relationships with key stakeholders   We continue to build our relationship with the South African Social Security Agency (“SASSA”) through proactive engagement at a local, provincial and national level.
We have also made good progress on building relationships with our various key stakeholders, be it shareholders, regulators, suppliers and other participants in our sectors.   Impact of COVID-19   During the most recent quarter, we did not experience any significant disruptions from the COVID-19 outbreak, and the risk relating to the outbreak appears to have substantially reduced. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors— We are unable to ascertain the full impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future financial position, operations, cash flows and stock price” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.   Impact of loadshedding
The trading environment remains challenging with increased loadshedding in the past few months. This adversely impacts our customers on a daily basis, especially in our Merchant business, where they lose valuable trading hours if they do not have access to alternative power supplies and back-up facilities to process electronic payments and value-added services. Our teams have delivered excellent growth in the merchant business despite these challenges.
Critical Accounting Policies   Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, including the ongoing uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the outbreak of COVID-19. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of estimates requires management’s judgment based on a variety of assumptions and other determinants such as historical experience, current and expected market conditions and certain scientific evaluation techniques.
Critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that are described in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022:   
Business Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill; 
Intangible Assets Acquired Through Acquisitions; 
Revenue recognition – principal versus agent considerations; 
Valuation of investment in Cell C; 
Recoverability of equity securities and equity-accounted investments; 
Deferred Taxation; 
Stock-based Compensation; and 

17.0212   15.9306   17.0212   15.9306   16.2903   Translation exchange rates for financial reporting purposes   We are required to translate our results of operations from ZAR to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis. Thus, the average rates used to translate this data for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, vary slightly from the averages shown in the table above. The translation rates we use in presenting our results of operations are the rates shown in the following table:                         Three months ended   Six months ended   Year ended Table 2 December 31,   December 31,   June 30,   2022   2021   2022   2021   2022 Income and expense items: $1 = ZAR

17.0212   15.9306   17.0212   15.9306   16.2903   42   Results of Operations   The discussion of our consolidated overall results of operations is based on amounts as reflected in our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We analyze our results of operations both in U.S. dollars, as presented in the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements , and supplementally in ZAR, because ZAR is the functional currency of the entities which contribute the majority of our revenue and is the currency in which the majority of our transactions are initially incurred and measured. Due to the significant impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the ZAR on our reported results and because we use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency, we believe that the supplemental presentation of our results of operations in ZAR is useful to investors to understand the changes in the underlying trends of our business.
Our operating segment revenue presented in “—Results of operations by operating segment” represents total revenue per operating segment before intercompany eliminations. A reconciliation between total operating segment revenue and revenue presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements is included in Note 17 to those statements. Our chief operating decision maker is our Group Chief Executive Officer and he evaluates segment performance based on segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted for items mentioned in the next sentence (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). We do not allocate once-off items (as defined below), stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, certain lease charges (“Lease adjustments”), other items (including gains or losses on disposal of investments, fair value adjustments to equity securities, fair value adjustments to currency options), interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or loss from equity-accounted investments to our reportable segments. Once-off items represents non-recurring expense items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The Lease adjustments reflect lease charges and the Stock-based compensation adjustments reflect stock-based compensation expense and are both excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and are therefore reported as reconciling items to reconcile the reportable segments’ Segment Adjusted EBITDA to our loss before income tax expense.
Group Adjusted EBITDA represents Segment Adjusted EBITDA after deducting group costs. Unless otherwise stated, reference to EBITDA in the discussion below refers to Segment Adjusted EBITDA.
Fiscal 2023 includes Connect for the entire quarter and first half of fiscal 2023, and this business is not included in the results for fiscal 2022.
We analyze our business and operations in terms of two inter-related but independent operating segments: (1) Consumer and (2) Merchant. In addition, corporate activities that are impracticable to allocate directly to the operating segments, as well as any inter-segment eliminations, are included in Group costs. Inter-segment revenue eliminations are included in Corporate/ Eliminations.
Second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to second quarter of fiscal 2022   The following factors had a significant impact on our results of operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared with the same period in the prior year:   
Higher revenue:
Our revenues increased 398% in ZAR, primarily due to the contribution from Connect, higher ad hoc hardware sales revenue, and an increase in account fees and insurance revenues; 
Lower operating losses:
Operating losses decreased, delivering an improvement of 74% in ZAR compared with the prior period primarily due to the contribution from Connect, strong hardware sales and the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives in our Consumer business, which was partially offset by an increase in acquisition related intangible asset amortization;

Higher net interest charge:
The net interest charge increased to ZAR 70.0 million from ZAR 7.0 million due to the additional borrowings incurred in order to fund the acquisition of Connect as well as the debt acquired within the Connect business itself; and 
Foreign exchange movements:
The U.S. dollar was 14% stronger against the ZAR during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior period, which impacted our reported results.   43   Consolidated overall results of operations   This discussion is based on the amounts prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   The following tables show the changes in the items comprising our statements of operations, both in U.S. dollars and in ZAR:   Table 3 In United States Dollars   Three months ended December 31,   2022   2021       $ ’000   $ ’000 change Revenue

315   -   nm Net loss attributable to us
(116,463)   (190,804)   (39%)   The increase in revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of Connect, which has substantial low margin prepaid airtime sales in addition to its core processing revenue, higher hardware sales revenue, and an increase in account fees and insurance revenues.
The increase in cost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support was primarily due to the inclusion of Connect, which were partially offset by the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives in our Consumer business and lower insurance-related claims.   In ZAR, the increase in selling, general and administration expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses related to the expansion of our senior management team, the year-over-year impact of inflationary increases on employee-related expenses and the inclusion of expenses related to Connect’s operations, which were partially offset by the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives in our Consumer business.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the inclusion of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization related to intangible assets identified pursuant to the Connect acquisition, as well as the inclusion of depreciation expense related to Connect’s property, plant and equipment.   Transaction costs related to the Connect Group acquisition include fees paid to external service providers for various advisory services procured during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 44   Our operating loss margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was (1.6%) and (30.3%), respectively. We discuss the components of operating loss margin under “—Results of operations by operating segment.”
We did not record any changes in the fair value of equity interests in MobiKwik and Cell C during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We continue to carry our investment in Cell C at $0 (zero). Refer to Note 4 for the methodology and inputs used in the fair value calculation for Cell C.   Interest on surplus cash increased to $0.4 million (ZAR 6.8 million) from $0.3 million (ZAR 4.8 million), primarily due to the inclusion of Connect.   Interest expense increased to $4.4 million (ZAR 76.9 million) from $0.8 million (ZAR 11.8 million), primarily as a result of additional interest expense incurred related to borrowings obtained to partially fund the acquisition of Connect, interest expenses incurred in Connect to fund our cash management, digitization and VAS offerings, and a higher utilization of our facilities to fund our ATMs, which was also coupled with an increase in the interest rate on those ATM facilities.   Fiscal 2023 tax expense was $0.36 million (ZAR 6.4 million) compared to the tax expense of $0.1 million (ZAR 1.5 million) in fiscal 2022.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was impacted by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, a deferred tax benefit related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.   Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was impacted by the tax effect of the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities (including the unrealized loss on the foreign currency options).   Finbond is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and reports its six-month results during our first quarter and its annual results during our fourth quarter.

This revenue growth was achieved notwithstanding the significant downsizing of our branch network and sales team. The cost reduction initiatives we initiated in fiscal 2022 delivered a significant reduction in our Consumer segment’s operating expenses which resulted in a positive EBITDA result compared with an EBITDA loss in fiscal 2022. Specifically, expenses associated with operating a mobile distribution network were discontinued in early fiscal 2022, and we have streamlined our fixed distribution network through reductions in certain expenses including employee-related costs, security, guarding and premises costs.
Our EBITDA (loss) margin (calculated as EBITDA (loss) divided by revenue) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 3.7% and (26.2%), respectively. 46   Merchant   Segment revenue increased due to the contribution from Connect as well as strong ad hoc hardware sales. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to the inclusion of Connect, as well as the higher hardware sales, which was partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. Connect records a significant proportion of its airtime sales in revenue and cost of sales, while only earning a relatively small margin. This significantly depresses the EBITDA margins shown by the business.   Our EBITDA margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 7.6% and 6.9%, respectively.   Group costs   Our group costs generally include employee related costs in relation to employees specifically hired for group roles and related directly to managing the US-listed entity; expenditures related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; non-employee directors’ fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit fees; and directors and officer’s insurance premiums.   Our group costs for fiscal 2023 increased compared with the prior period due to higher employee costs and an increase in director and officer’s insurance premiums, which was partially offset by lower consulting fees.   First half of fiscal 2023 compared to first half of fiscal 2022   The following factors had a significant impact on our results of operations during the first half of fiscal 2023 as compared with the same period in the prior year:   
Higher revenue:
Our revenues increased 358% in ZAR, primarily due to the contribution from Connect, higher ad hoc hardware sales revenue, and an increase in account fees and insurance revenues; 
Lower operating losses:
Operating losses decreased, delivering an improvement of 62% in ZAR compared with the prior period primarily due to the contribution from Connect, strong hardware sales, and the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives in our Consumer business, which was partially offset by an increase in acquisition related intangible asset amortization;

Higher net interest charge:
The net interest charge increased to ZAR 131.5 million from ZAR 13.2 million due to the additional borrowings incurred in order to fund the acquisition of Connect as well as the debt acquired within the Connect business itself; and 
Foreign exchange movements:
The U.S. dollar was 15% stronger against the ZAR during the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior period, which impacted our reported results.   47   Consolidated overall results of operations   This discussion is based on the amounts prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   The following tables show the changes in the items comprising our statements of operations, both in U.S. dollars and in ZAR:   Table 8 In United States Dollars   Six months ended December 31,   2022   2021       $ ’000   $ ’000 change Revenue

We discuss the components of operating loss margin under “—Results of operations by operating segment.”
We did not record any changes in the fair value of equity interests in MobiKwik and Cell C during the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We continue to carry our investment in Cell C at $0 (zero). Refer to Note 4 for the methodology and inputs used in the fair value calculation for Cell C.   We recorded a gain of $0.3 million related to the disposal of our entire interest in Carbon during the first half of fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this disposal.   Interest on surplus cash increased to $0.8 million (ZAR 13.8 million) from $0.7 million (ZAR 10.5 million), primarily due to the inclusion of Connect.   Interest expense increased to $8.4 million (ZAR 145.3 million) from $1.6 million (ZAR 23.7 million), primarily as a result of additional interest expense incurred related to borrowings obtained to partially fund the acquisition of Connect, interest expenses incurred in Connect to fund our cash management, digitization and VAS offerings, and a higher utilization of our facilities to fund our ATMs, which was also coupled with an increase in the interest rate on these ATM facilities.   Fiscal 2023 tax expense was $0.4 million (ZAR 6.8 million) compared to the tax expense of $0.3 million (ZAR 4.3 million) in fiscal 2022.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was impacted by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, a deferred tax benefit related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.   Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was impacted by the tax effect of the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities (including the unrealized loss on the foreign currency options).   Finbond is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and reports its six-month results during our first quarter and its annual results during our fourth quarter.

The cost reduction initiatives we initiated in fiscal 2022 delivered a significant reduction in our Consumer segment’s operating expenses which resulted in a significantly lower EBITDA loss compared with fiscal 2022. Specifically, expenses associated with operating a mobile distribution network were discontinued in early fiscal 2022, and we have streamlined our fixed distribution network through reductions in certain expenses including employee-related costs, security, guarding and premises costs.
Our EBITDA loss margin (calculated as EBITDA loss divided by revenue) for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was (2.7%) and (40.6%), respectively. 50   Merchant   Segment revenue increased due to the contribution from Connect as well as strong ad hoc hardware sales. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to the inclusion of Connect, as well as the higher hardware sales, which was partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.   Our EBITDA margin for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 7.4% and 9.7%, respectively.   Group costs   Our group costs for fiscal 2023 increased compared with the prior period due to higher employee costs and an increase in director and officer’s insurance premiums, which was partially offset by lower consulting fees.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were $42.4 million and comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated balances of $7.5 million, ZAR-denominated balances of ZAR 561.6 million ($33.0 million), and other currency deposits, primarily Botswana pula, of $1.9 million, all amounts translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in our unrestricted cash balances from June 30, 2022, was primarily due to the utilization of cash reserves to fund our Consumer operations, make certain scheduled repayments of our borrowings, purchase ATMs and safe assets, and to make an investment in working capital in our Consumer and Merchant operations, which was partially offset by the utilization of our available borrowings and a positive contribution from Connect.   We generally invest any surplus cash held by our South African operations in overnight call accounts that we maintain at South African banking institutions, and any surplus cash held by our non-South African companies in U.S. dollar-denominated money market accounts.
Historically, we have financed most of our operations, research and development, working capital, and capital expenditures, as well as acquisitions and strategic investments, through internally generated cash and our financing facilities. When considering whether to borrow under our financing facilities, we consider the cost of capital, cost of financing, opportunity cost of utilizing surplus cash and availability of tax efficient structures to moderate financing costs. For instance, in fiscal 2022, we obtained loan facilities from RMB to fund a portion of our acquisition of Connect, with the balance being funded from cash resources. Following the acquisition of Connect, we now utilize a combination of short and long-term facilities to fund our operating activities and a long-term asset-backed facility to fund the acquisition of POS devices and safe assets. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, for additional information related to our borrowings.     51   Available short-term borrowings   Summarized below are our short-term facilities available and utilized as of December 31, 2022:   Table 13 RMB Facility E   RMB Indirect   RMB Connect   Nedbank   $ ’000   ZAR ’000   $ ’000   ZAR ’000   $ ’000   ZAR ’000   $ ’000   ZAR ’000 Total short-term facilities available, comprising:                               Overdraft

(2) Indirect and derivative facilities may only be used for guarantees, letters of credit and forward exchange contracts to support guarantees issued by RMB and Nedbank to various third parties on our behalf.   Long-term borrowings   We have aggregate long-term borrowing outstanding of ZAR 2.4 billion ($142.9 million translated at exchange rates as of December 31, 2022) as described in Note 8. These borrowings include outstanding long-term borrowings obtained by Lesaka SA of ZAR 1.0 billion to partially fund the acquisition of Connect. In contemplation of the Connect transaction, Connect obtained total facilities of approximately ZAR 1.3 billion which were utilized to repay its existing borrowings, to fund a portion of its capital expenditures and to settle obligations under the transaction documents. We also have a revolving credit facility, of ZAR 300.0 million which is utilized to fund a portion of our merchant finance loans receivable book.   Restricted cash   We have credit facilities with RMB in order to access cash to fund our ATMs in South Africa. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2022, includes restricted cash of approximately $54.2 million related to cash withdrawn from our debt facility to fund ATMs. This cash may only be used to fund ATMs and is considered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet.   We have also entered into cession and pledge agreements with Nedbank related to our Nedbank indirect credit facilities and we have ceded and pledged certain bank accounts to Nedbank. The funds included in these bank accounts are restricted as they may not be withdrawn without the express permission of Nedbank. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2022, includes restricted cash of approximately $0.2 million that has been ceded and pledged. 52     Cash flows from operating activities   Second quarter   Net cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of fiscal
2023
was $3.4 million (ZAR 59.9 million) compared to net cash used in operating activities of $13.8 million (ZAR 212.0 million) during the second quarter of fiscal
2022 . Excluding the impact of income taxes, our cash used in operating activities during the second quarter of fiscal
2023 was impacted by month-end working capital movements (primarily an increase in accounts payable balances) within our merchant business which generally unwind in the following month, and growth in our consumer and merchant finance loans receivable books , which was partially offset by the positive contribution from Connect.   During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we
paid first provisional South African tax payments of $2.5 million (ZAR 42.6 million) related to our 2023 tax year.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we
paid first provisional South African tax payments of $0.4 million (ZAR 6.9 million) related to our 2023 tax year.   Taxes paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were as follows:   Table 14 Three months ended December 31,   2022   2021   2022   2021 $ $ ZAR ZAR ‘000 ‘000 ‘000 ‘000 First provisional payments

2022 . Excluding the impact of income taxes, our cash used in operating activities during the first half of fiscal
2023 was impacted by month-end working capital movements (primarily an increase in accounts payable balances) within our merchant business which generally unwind in the following month, and growth in our consumer and merchant finance loans receivable books, and the
utilization of cash reserves to fund our Consumer operations, which was partially offset by the positive contribution from Connect.   During the first half of fiscal 2023, we
paid first provisional South African tax payments of $3.0 million (ZAR 50.8 million) related to our 2023 tax year, and additional second provisional South African tax payments of $0.2 million (ZAR 3.4 million) related to our 2022 tax year.

2023 , we utilized approximately $167.2 million from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs and our cash management business through Connect, and repaid $175.4 million of those facilities. We utilized approximately $9.1 million of our long-term borrowings to fund our merchant finance loans receivable business and to fund the acquisition of certain capital expenditures. We repaid approximately $1.7 million of long-term borrowings in accordance with our repayment schedule. We received $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options. We also paid $0.1 million to repurchase shares from employees in order for the employees to settle taxes due related to the vesting of shares of restricted stock.   During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we received $0.7 million from the exercise of stock options, and utilized approximately $172.4 million from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs and repaid $172.8 million of those facilities.   First half   During the first half of fiscal

Capital Expenditures   We expect capital spending for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to primarily include investments into our ATM infrastructure and branch network in South Africa as well as IT equipment, and through Connect, spending for POS devices, safe assets, vehicles, computer and office equipment. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 are discussed under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash flows from investing activities.” All of our capital expenditures for the past three fiscal years were funded through internally generated funds, or, following the Connect acquisition, our asset-backed borrowing arrangement. We had outstanding capital commitments as of December 31, 2022, of $3.1 million. We expect to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds and available facilities.   54   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   In addition to the tables below, see Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of market risk.   We have short and long-term borrowings in South Africa which attract interest at rates that fluctuate based on changes in the South African prime and 3-month JIBAR interest rates. The following table illustrates the effect on our annual expected interest charge, translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2022, as a result of changes in the South African prime and 3-month JIBAR interest rates, using our outstanding short and long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2022. The effect of a hypothetical 1% (i.e. 100 basis points) increase and a 1% decrease in the interest rates applicable to the borrowings as of December 31, 2022, are shown. The selected 1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best- or worst-case scenarios.   Table 16 As of December 31, 2022   Annual expected interest charge

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the group chief executive officer and the group chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   56   Item 6.
