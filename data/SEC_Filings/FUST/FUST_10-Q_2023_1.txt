NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2022
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1

Organization and Operations
Fuse Group Holding Inc. (the “Company” or “Fuse Group” or “We”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 24, 2013. Fuse Group currently develops business opportunities in the mining and biotech areas. On December 6, 2016, the Company incorporated Fuse Processing, Inc. (“Processing”) in the State of California. Processing seeks business opportunities in mining and is currently investigating potential mining targets in Asia and North America. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Processing.
Fuse Group and Processing provide consulting services to mining industry clients to find mine acquisition targets within the parameters set by the clients, when the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. The services of Fuse Group and Processing include due diligence on the potential mine seller and mine, such as ownership and whether the mine meets all operational requirements and/or is currently in operation.
In March 2017, Processing acquired
100 % ownership of Fuse Trading Limited (“Trading”) for HKD1 ($ 0.13 ). Trading had no operations prior to the acquisition by Processing. Trading was seeking mining-related business opportunities in Asia. On April 22, 2022, Processing entered into a Share Transfer Agreement to transfer
100 % ownership of Trading to an unrelated party for HKD1. There was no gain or loss recognized from the ownership transfer of Trading. Trading did not have any assets or business operations as of the date of transfer.
On May 3, 2018, the Company incorporated Fuse Technology Inc. in the State of Nevada, which changed its name to Fuse Biotech Inc. on November 30, 2020. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Fuse Biotech Inc. (“Fuse Biotech”). Fuse Biotech seeks business opportunities in the biotech area.
On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (“Amendment”) to change its name from Fuse Enterprises Inc. to Fuse Group Holding Inc. Also on April 29, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock approved the Amendment. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada on April 30, 2019 and became effective May 13, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company changed its trading symbol on OTC Markets from FNST to FUST.
On February 9, 2021, Fuse Group and Processing entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with
five
individuals who own Portafolio en Investigacion Ambiental S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company (“Portafolio”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue
14,285,715
shares of Company’s common stock for all the shares of Portafolio they owned. Portafolio owns concessions rights to five mineral locations in Mexico. The five mines have not been explored and have no operations, no facilities or equipment, no existing contracts for the sale of output, and no permits or licenses to conduct mining operations other than five concessions to explore. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the surface rights and permits that are necessary to extract the minerals from the areas covered by the concessions. The transfer of shares of Portafolio to Processing are subject to Mexican government approval, which has not happened yet.
Stock certificates for 14,285,715 shares were prepared for the closing of the Agreement which was entered into by the Company and Processing with the five individuals who own Portafolio on February 9, 2021. The stock certificates were prepared by the Company, but not delivered to the sellers. After reevaluation of the Agreement, the Company determined that the transaction was incorrectly recorded, as such stock certificates remained in the custody of the Company and not delivered (i.e. provided as consideration) to the sellers. On October 20, 2021, the Company cancelled these stock certificates.
On March 11, 2021, Fuse Group and Fuse Biotech entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Nevada (the “E-Mo Biotech”), Qiyi Xie, a resident of California (“Xie”), Quan Qinghua, a citizen and resident of China (“Quan”), Jing Li, a citizen and resident of China (“Li”) and HWG Capital Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated under laws of Malaysia (“HWG” and hereinafter collectively with Xie, Quan and Li, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to issue the Sellers
100,000,000
shares of Company’s common stock (the “Fuse Shares”) for all the issued and outstanding shares of E-Mo Biotech (the “E-Mo Shares”) owned by the Sellers. E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc. is a start-up, development-stage company involving in vaccine, immunological treatment and diagnostic product research and development and has no commercial sales of vaccines, treatments, or diagnostic products. The acquisition was not completed and the Fuse Shares were not issued. On September 30, 2021, the Company and Fuse Biotech entered into a Termination Agreement with E-Mo Biotech, Qiyi Xie, Quan Qinghua, Jing Li and HWG Capital Sdn Bhd, effective on September 30, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed to terminate the Share Exchange Agreement, which was originally entered into by and among the Company, Fuse Biotech, the Sellers and E-Mo Biotech on March 11, 2021.

Table of Contents
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in the US. The state of California, where the Company is headquartered, has been affected by COVID-19.
Our business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic impacted the Company’s business development, and disrupted or delayed the Company’s current mine projects and services to its clients, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on the Company’s ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course. Quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted the Company’s abilities to visit mines in Mexico and in Asian counties as well as to meet with potential clients and mine owners for the Company’s consulting business and for the Company’s own investment in mine projects. The Company’s clients that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may cancel or suspend their mine acquisition projects, which in turn will reduce their demands for the Company’s services and materially adversely impact the Company’s revenue. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding COVID-19 and new variants, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and/or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
The global economy was also negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The U.S. and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which could seriously affect people’s investment desires in mines in Mexico, Asia and internationally. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company’s ability to access capital, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP were not included. The interim consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, previously filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include all significant normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022, its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were made.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fuse Group and its subsidiaries, Processing, Trading, and Biotech. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification
Certain prior period’s accounts have been reclassified in conformity with current period’s presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.
Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be considered cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value. The Company had $ 67,581
and $ 32,996
in cash at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

Table of Contents
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimated useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment, recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accrued liabilities and accounts payable, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. FASB ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for current liabilities qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and the current market rate of interest.
FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows:
●
Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include other than those in level 1 quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other payables and accrued expenses, approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value on a recurring basis.
Accounts Receivable
The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. The Company had $ 0
accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.

Table of Contents
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; while additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets and estimated lives as follows:
Computer and office equipment
5
years
Office furniture
7
years
Leasehold decoration and renovation
10
years
Related Parties
The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB ASC for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant to Section 850-10-20, related parties include: (a) affiliates of the Company; (b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions eliminated in the preparation of financial statements is not required in those statements.
The disclosures shall include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.
Contingencies
The Company follows FASB ASC 450-20 to account for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss was incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The core principle underlying FASB ASC 606 is that the Company recognizes revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This requires the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are recognized when control of goods and services transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive for those goods.
The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. For the Company’s mine information service, revenue is recognized when the mine information is forwarded to the client. The services of Fuse Group and Processing include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.
Income Tax
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current period and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets also include the prior years’ net operating losses carried forward. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740, which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures.
Under FASB ASC Topic 740, when tax returns are filed, it is likely that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and there were no charges during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and accordingly, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. There was no accrual for uncertain tax position as of December 31, 2022. The Company files a U.S. income tax return. With few exceptions, the U.S. income tax returns filed for the years ending on September 30, 2020 and thereafter are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities.
Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options and warrants were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and warrants, and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible instruments. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later) and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, outstanding convertible instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later).

Cash Flows Reporting
The Company follows paragraph 230-10-45-24 of FASB ASC for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect Method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of FASB ASC to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of FASB ASC.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract under ASC Topic 842. At the commencement of each lease, management determines its classification as an operating or finance lease. For leases that qualify as operating leases, Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of its leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The ROU assets include adjustments for prepayments and accrued lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options.
The Company leases premises for office under non-cancellable operating lease. Operating lease payments are expensed over the term of lease. The Company’s current lease does not include options to extend nor any restrictions or covenants. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company has no legal or contractual asset retirement obligations at the end of the lease. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current), on the consolidated balance sheets.
A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. When determining whether a lease qualifies as a short-term lease, the Company evaluates the lease term and the purchase option. Hence, the Company does not recognize any operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities for short-term leases.
ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets. ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The Company recognized no impairment of ROU assets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance should be adopted on a prospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”). ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply the elections as applicable as changes in the market occur.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The adoption of this ASU does not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 7,556,096
at December 31, 2022, the Company incurred net loss of $ 121,879
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and the Company had cash outflow from operating activities of $ 114,865
for the three months ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company’s business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and continue to be adversely affect by the COVID-19 (see Note 1). These raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering, or by obtaining loans from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering or loans from banks or others.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Loans Payable
On May 14, 2020, Processing received $ 49,600
from the Paycheck Protection Program loan (“PPP loan”) from U.S. Small Business Administration (“the SBA”).
The loan was to be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities (at least 60% of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll).
The loan amount not forgiven, had annual interest of
1 %.
Loan repayments will be deferred to either (1) the date that SBA remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender or (2) if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness covered period. Loans issued prior to June 5, 2020 have a maturity of two years, loans issued after June 5, 2020 have a maturity of five years. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. A borrower may apply for loan forgiveness any time on or before the maturity date of the loan, including before the end of the Covered Period (either (1) the 24-week (168-day) period beginning on the PPP Loan Disbursement Date, or (2) if the Borrower received its PPP loan before June 5, 2020, the Borrower may elect to use an eight-week (56-day) Covered Period); provided such application for loan forgiveness is made within 10 months after the last day of the covered period, otherwise the loan is no longer deferred and the borrower must begin paying principal and interest. In the end of 2020, the U.S. Treasury and SBA announced a streamlined PPP forgiveness application for loans of $50,000 or less (unless those borrowers together with their affiliates received loans totaling $2 million or more). It requires fewer calculations and may call for less documentation. It does not require borrowers to reduce their loan forgiveness calculations if they reduced full-time equivalent or salaries.
The forgiveness application processing time may also be shorter. Fuse Processing PPP loan forgiveness was approved in June 2021, the Company recorded $ 49,600
PPP loan forgiveness as other income during the year ended September 30, 2021.
On June 24, 2020, Fuse Biotech received $ 105,400
from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL loan”) from the SBA after deducting $ 100
Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) handling charge and filing fee. This is a low-interest federal disaster loan for working capital to small businesses and non-profit organizations of any size suffering substantial economic injury as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), to help the businesses to meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster not occurred. This loan has annual interest of
3.75 % and is not forgivable. The maturity of the loan is
30
years, installment payments including principal and interest of $ 515
monthly will begin 12 months from the date of loan approval date. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 995
and $ 1,015 , respectively, as interest expense for the EIDL loan. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made $ 1,545
and $ 1,545
(including principal and interest) repayment of the EIDL loan, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum principal amount of loan payments to be paid by year are as follows:

Income Tax
At December 31, and September 30, 2022, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for income tax purposes. For federal income tax purposes, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may only reduce 80% of a taxpayer’s taxable income, and may be carried forward indefinitely; for California income tax purposes, the entire NOL can be carried forward up to 20 years. However, the coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“the CARES Act”) issued in March 2020, provides tax relief to both corporate and noncorporate taxpayers by adding a five-year carryback period and temporarily repealing the 80% limitation for NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company estimated NOL carry-forwards for Federal and California income tax purposes of $ 4.99
million and $ 4.93
million for each of Federal and California state at December 31, 2022, respectively. No tax benefit was reported with respect to these NOL carry-forwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the Company believes the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets for the NOL for both federal and California State of approximately $ 1.39
million as of December 31, 2022, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by a full valuation allowance.
Components of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are as follows:

Overview
Fuse Group Holding Inc. (the “Company” or “Fuse Group” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 24, 2013. Fuse Group currently develops opportunities in mining and biotech areas. On December 6, 2016, the Company incorporated Fuse Processing, Inc. (“Processing”) in the State of California. Processing seeks business opportunities in mining and is currently investigating potential mining targets in Asia and North America. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Processing. In March 2017, Processing acquired 100% ownership of Fuse Trading Limited (“Trading”) for HKD1 ($0.13). Trading had no operations prior to the acquisition by Processing, and Trading expected to be engaged in mining-related businesses. On April 22, 2022, Processing transferred 100% ownership of Trading to an unrelated third party for HKD1. On May 3, 2018, the Company incorporated Fuse Technology Inc. in the State of Nevada, which changed its name to Fuse Biotech Inc. on November 30, 2020. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Fuse Biotech Inc. (“Fuse Biotech”). Fuse Biotech originally engaged in IMETAL system development. The Company originally planned to operate IMETAL as a platform to facilitate investment and trade in raw metals, find specialized minerals, exploit these opportunities and issue tokens to be used on the platform, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Due to the development of laws and regulations on token issuance and trading, management discussed its function and compliance issues with the designer of the platform and concluded the project had more issues and costs for compliance than originally expected, on December 23, 2019, the Board decided to terminate the IMETAL project. Currently, Fuse Biotech seeks business opportunities in the biotech area.
Fuse Group and Processing provide consulting services to mining industry clients to find acquisition targets within the parameters set by the clients, when the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. The services of Fuse Group and Processing include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.
On January 4, 2017, Processing entered into a Consulting and Strategist Agreement with a consulting company for a six-month term. On July 3, 2017, Processing and the consulting company extended the Consulting and Strategist Agreement until January 3, 2018 at no additional cost, and the Agreement was subsequently extended to July 3, 2018. The consultant provides Processing with market research, exploration and advise on business development opportunities in certain countries, and other general business advisory services. Processing paid a deposit of $1,325,000 for the consulting fee, of which, $325,000 was expensed as a consulting fee based on the agreement, and the remaining $1,000,000 of which would have been refunded to the Company if the Company had not made an investment and/or entered into a business relationship in Mexico. The consulting company found acquisition targets for the Company, and on June 22, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a seller to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations located in different areas of Mexico for $1,000,000. Upon execution of the MOU, the Company acquired the exclusive right to purchase the concessions rights to mines from the seller until September 30, 2018. The parties entered into an oral agreement that the Company would pay a purchase price of $1,000,000 to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations that would be consolidated into a local company in Mexico upon the approval from the Mexican government allowing the transfer of all mining concession to a Mexican company.
On February 9, 2021, the Company and Processing entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Choo Keam Hui, Goh Hau Guan, Lim Hui Sing, Teh Boon Nee and Tia Chai Teck (collectively as the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the Sellers in aggregate of 14,285,715 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Fuse Shares”) in exchange of all the outstanding shares of Portafolio en Investigacion Ambiental S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company ("Portafolio”) owned by the Sellers. Portafolio owns concessions rights to five mineral locations and the five mines have not been explored and have no operations, no existing contracts for the sale of output, no permits or licenses to conduct mining operations. Portafolio only has five concessions to explore for minerals and owns no facilities or equipment. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the surface rights and permits that are necessary to extract the minerals from the areas covered by the concessions. The Company is waiting for the Sellers to complete the transfer process for the equity interest of Portafolio to the Processing to complete the transaction.

Stock certificates for 14,285,715 shares were prepared by the Company for the closing of the transaction contemplated in the Agreement but were not delivered to the Sellers. After reevaluation of the Agreement, the Company determined that the transaction was incorrectly recorded, as such stock certificates remained in the custody of the Company and not delivered (i.e. provided as consideration) to the Sellers. On October 20, 2021, the Company cancelled these stock certificates.
On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors (“BOD”) of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to change its name from Fuse Enterprises Inc. to Fuse Group Holding Inc. Also on April 29, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock approved the Amendment. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada on April 30, 2019, and became effective on May 13, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company changed its trading symbol on OTC Markets from FNST to FUST.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in the US. The state of California, where the Company is headquartered, has been affected by COVID-19.
Our business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic negatively impacted our business development, and disrupted or delayed our current mine projects and services to our clients, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
Quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted our abilities to visit mines in Mexico and Asian counties as well as to meet with potential clients and mine owners for our consulting business and our own investment in mine projects. Our clients that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may cancel or suspend their mine acquisition projects, which in turn will reduce their demands for our services and materially adversely impact our revenue. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding COVID-19 and new variants, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and/or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The U.S. and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect people’s investment desires in mines in Mexico, Asia and internationally.
While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
We received a $49,600 Paycheck Protection Program loan (“PPP loan”) and a $105,500 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL loan”) from US Small Business Administration (“the SBA”) during the year ended September 30, 2020. The forgiveness of $49,600 PPP loan was approved in June 2021.
We currently believe our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, the outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.
On March 11, 2021, Fuse Group and Fuse Biotech entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Nevada (the “E-Mo Biotech”), Qiyi Xie, a resident of California (“Xie”), Quan Qinghua, a citizen and resident of China (“Quan”), Jing Li, a citizen and resident of China (“Li”) and HWG Capital Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated under laws of Malaysia (“HWG” and hereinafter collectively with Xie, Quan and Li, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will issue the Sellers 100,000,000 shares of Company’s common stock (the “Fuse Shares”) for all the issued and outstanding shares of E-Mo Biotech (the “E-Mo Shares”) owned by the Sellers. E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc. is a start-up, development-stage company involving in vaccine, immunological treatment and diagnostic product research and development and has no commercial sales of vaccines, treatments, or diagnostic products. The acquisition was not completed and the Fuse Shares were not issued. On September 30, 2021, the Company and Fuse Biotech entered into a Termination Agreement with E-Mo Biotech, the Sellers, effective on September 30, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed to terminate the Share Exchange Agreement, which was originally entered into by and among the Company, Fuse Biotech, the Sellers and E-Mo Biotech on March 11, 2021.

Results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue and Cost of Revenue
We develop our business in mining and investigate potential mining targets in Asia and North America. In addition to our own investment in mining businesses, we provide consulting services to clients which are mining business investors with potential mine acquisition targets within the specific parameters set by those clients, where the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. Our services include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.
Our revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was nil. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we provided two potential mine opportunities in Mexico to a client. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded revenue of $200,000 for the services provided. Our cost of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was nil and $10,015, respectively, which was mainly for the consulting expenses paid for mine expertise during the mine due diligence period for the three months ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a gross profit of nil and $189,985 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

If we are not successful in developing the mining business and establishing profitability and positive cash flow, additional capital may be required to maintain ongoing operations. We have explored and continue to explore options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from other third parties or banks, and other similar actions. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common stock, loans from financial institutions, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses. The control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses are as described below.
1. We do not have an Audit Committee. While we are not legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is of the utmost importance for entity-level control over the Company’s financial statements. Currently, the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of an audit committee.
2. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was retaining copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of the data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.
3. We currently lack sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. We have one employee assigned to a position that involves processing financial information, resulting in a lack of segregation of duties so that all journal entries and account reconciliations are reviewed by someone other than the preparer, heightening the risk of error or fraud.
We have taken certain actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We have engaged an outside CPA with U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to supplement our current internal accounting personnel and assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or other control deficiencies are identified, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports as a public company in a timely manner. Due to our small size and the early stage of our business, segregation of duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. We have limited capital resources and have given priority in the use of those resources to our business development efforts. As a result, we have not been able to take steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. However, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis. As our operations grow and become more complex, we intend to hire additional personnel in financial reporting and other areas. However, there can be no assurance of when, if ever, we will be able to remediate the identified material weaknesses.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings
We may from time to time be party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As we grow and gain prominence in the marketplace we may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings.
