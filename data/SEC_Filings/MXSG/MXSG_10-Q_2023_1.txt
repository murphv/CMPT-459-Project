MEXUS GOLD US AND SUBSIDARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OF COMPANY
Mexus Gold US (the “Company”) was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on
June 22, 1990 , as U.S.A. Connection, Inc.  On September 18, 2009, the Company changed its’ domicile to
Nevada
and changed its’ name to Mexus Gold US to better reflect the Company’s new planned principal business operations. The Company has a fiscal year end of March 31.
The Company is a mining company engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold, silver and copper projects in the State of Sonora, Mexico and the Western United States, as well as the salvage of precious metals from identifiable sources.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information normally included in condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. The condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet on March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using currently available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Three-month figures are not necessarily indicative of the results to be reported at the year end.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and controlled subsidiaries, Mexus Gold Mining, S.A. de C.V. (“Mexus Gold Mining), Mexus Enterprises S.A. de C.V. (“Mexus Gold Enterprises”) and Mexus Gold MX S.A. DE C.V. (“Mexus Gold MX”). Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management believes that the estimates used are reasonable. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include, among others, the accrual of potential liabilities, the assumptions used in valuing share-based instruments issued for services, valuation of derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
7
Equipment
Equipment consists of mining tools and equipment, watercraft and vehicles which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows (see Note 4):
Mining tools and equipment
7
years
Watercraft
7
years
Vehicles
3
years
Exploration and Development Costs
Exploration costs incurred in locating areas of potential mineralization or evaluating properties or working interests with specific areas of potential mineralization are expensed as incurred. Development costs of proven mining properties not yet producing are capitalized at cost and classified as capitalized exploration costs under property, plant and equipment. Property holding costs are charged to operations during the period if no significant exploration or development activities are being conducted on the related properties. Upon commencement of production, capitalized exploration and development costs would be amortized based on the estimated proven and probable reserves benefited. Properties determined to be impaired or that are abandoned are written-down to the estimated fair value. Carrying values do not necessarily reflect present or future values.
Mineral Property Rights
Costs of acquiring mining properties are capitalized upon acquisition. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits, to expand the capacity of mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are also capitalized once proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property. Costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property and equipment costs, to determine if these costs are in excess of their recoverable amount whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Evaluation of the carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10-35-15,
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Included in the ASC Topic 820 framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with Level 1 being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to Level 3 where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the Company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the Company. The Company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of ASC Topic 820 and the valuation method as exchange, income or use. The Company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item.
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, advances, notes payable, and a promissory note payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to
8
either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.
Secured convertible promissory note derivative and warrant liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the interest rates. The notes payable, loans payable and secured convertible promissory notes have fixed interest rates therefore the Company is exposed to interest rate risk in that they could not benefit from a decrease in market interest rates. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages exposure through its normal operating and financing activities.
Derivative Instruments
Accounting standards require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value.  A change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in results of operations in the period of change.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 740, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income.
To the extent that the Company incurs transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, they are undertaken in Mexican Pesos. The Company has not, as of the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Comprehensive Loss
ASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no items that represent a comprehensive loss, and therefore has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Tax”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
Asset Retirement Obligations
In accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (ASC 410), the Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The associated asset retirement costs are supposed to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related mineral properties. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 the Company has not recorded AROs associated with legal obligations to retire any of the Company’s mineral properties as the settlement dates are not presently determinable.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. The provisions of ASC 606 include a five-step process by which we determine revenue recognition, depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts reflecting the payment to which we
9
expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 requires us to apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.
ASC 505, "Compensation-Stock Compensation", establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to non-employees for goods or services. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505.
Per Share Data
Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, "Earnings per Share". Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.
On December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt— Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).
This update amends the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and improves and amends the related EPS guidance for both Subtopics. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning April 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our consolidated financial statements.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.
3. GOING CONCERN
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 921,466
and used cash in operating activities of $ 434,119 , and on December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of
10
$ 39,179,958 . On December 31, 2022, the Company is in the exploration stage. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued.  The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2022, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is dependent upon outside financing to continue operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management’s plans to raise necessary funds through a private placement of its common stock to satisfy the capital requirements of the Company’s business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds, or that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, that the Company will successfully execute its business plan.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to meet our obligations on a timely basis, and, to attain profitability.

COVID-19
The recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. Conditions surrounding the coronavirus continue to rapidly evolve and government authorities have implemented emergency measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. The outbreak and the related mitigation measures have had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on global economic conditions as well as on the Company's business activities. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Company's business activities will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States, Mexico and other countries to contain and treat the disease. These events are highly uncertain and, as such, the Company cannot determine their financial impact at this time.

The Company
Mexus Gold US is an exploration stage mining company engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold, silver and copper projects in the State of Sonora, Mexico. Mexus Gold US is dedicated to protect the environment and provide employment and education opportunities for the communities that it operates in.
Our President and CEO, Paul Thompson, brings over 45 years’ experience in mining and mining development to Mexus Gold US. Mr. Thompson is currently recruiting additional management personnel for its Mexico and Nevada mining operations.
Our executive offices are located at, 1805 N. Carson Street, #150, Carson City, Nevada 89701. Our telephone number is (916) 776 2166.
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 22, 1990, as U.S.A. Connection, Inc. On September 18, 2009, we changed our domicile to Nevada and changed our name to Mexus Gold US to better reflect our new business operations. Our fiscal year end is March 31 st .
Description of the Business of Mexus Gold US
Mexus Gold US is engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and development projects in the United Mexican States, as well as the salvage of precious metals from identifiable sources. Our main activities in the near future will be comprised of our mining operations in Mexico. Our mining opportunities located in the State of Sonora, Mexico will provide us with projects to recover gold, silver, copper and other precious metals.
19
In addition, our management will look for opportunities to improve the value of the gold projects that we own or may acquire knowledge of or may acquire control through exploration drilling, introduction of technological innovations or acquisition with the goal of developing those properties into operating mines. We expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and development will continue in the future.
Business Strategy
Our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the exploration and development of our mineral properties, utilizing the extensive mining-related background and capabilities of our management consultants and advisors. To achieve this goal, our business plan focuses on the following prospective areas:
Mining Operations
We classify our mineral properties into three categories: “Development Properties”, “Advanced Exploration Properties”, and “Other Exploration Properties”. Development Properties are properties where a decision to develop the property into a producing mine has been made. Advanced Exploration Properties are those properties where we retain a significant ownership interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis to identify and report proven and probable reserves or other mineralized material. We currently do not have a Development Property or Advanced Exploration Property. Other Exploration Properties are those that do not fall into the other categories. Please see below for information about our Other Exploration Properties.
Effective March 31, 2011, we acquired Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. (our wholly owned subsidiary) and began funding mining operations in Mexico. A small placer processing operation was instituted to evaluate various areas of interest within the project lands held by Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V.
Mexus Properties and Future Plans
Santa Elena Gold Project
The Company is managed by Paul Thompson Sr., President. The Santa Elena mine is located 54km NW of Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico. This fully permitted project consists of 9 concessions and totals over 6500 acres. The property is easily accessible from the local highway with major infrastructure a short distance away.  The Santa Elena project is 100% owned by Mexus Gold US.
Exploration at the Santa Elena project area has been systematically directed as initial surface geologic mapping and sampling with some ground geophysical surveys as electro magnetics and radiometric. Evaluation of results has led to continued production sampling with percussion drilling and diamond core drilling of portions of areas of interest. This resulted in 3 major geologic structures which are open pit mined and are the main source of production. The producing structures are all associated with mixed hydrothermal quartz vein fissure filling and orogenic thrust fault conduits and are in the order of 0.5 to 9 g/t gold. Additional structures are in the area and will soon be evaluated and brought to production. The exploration resulted in the discovery of three major targets on Mexus’ three of nine concessions located on the Santa Elena gold project. This resulted in the company opening 3 pits: Julio 1, Julio 2 and Mexus 3. Mineralized material was crushed to 1/2inch minus and transferred to the existing heap leach pad via a conveyor system. All three pits show mineable grade gold up to 1 oz. per ton. All 3 pits show a viable chemistry after running
four months and testing an estimated 25,000 tons. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is producing ore from the Julio 1 pit which is the most cost effective to mine and has proven to be very productive leaching material.
Preliminary reserve estimates at the Santa Elena project indicates a tonnage of approximately 1.5 to 5 million tons to a depth of 100 meters on the Julio structure. Geologic data further indicates the Julio structure is present at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 meters at a shallow incline. There are five additional structures that have been identified for further evaluation of the Santa Elena Projects lands.
Production was slowed due to COVID 19.
Return flow from the heap leach pad is running from .2 to .5 GPT of solution. At this stage of development, the company expects return from the heap leach pad flow and the activated carbon cell flow to match at 9 liters per second allowing a 24 hour a day, 7 day a week uninterrupted operation at an average of .35 per ton solution.
Three carbon cells are in use with 100% recovery in addition to the final recovery being an electro winning plant to clean the gold from the activated carbon. The electro winning plant takes approximately 30 hours to run 1 ton
20
of material carbon. The company has a complete and operable Merrill Crowe gold recovery plant on site as a back‐up.
Mabel Property
Mexus Gold MX, a fully owned subsidiary of Mexus Gold US, is 90% owner of the Mabel Project  comprised of approximately 2,128 hectares (5,258 acres) is located approximately 52Km’s SW from Nogales, Sonora State, Mexico and 34Km’s south of the United States border at Sasabe.
Mexus has decided to continue to validate a Technical Report on the advanced Gold and Porphyry Copper property. Completion of an updated 43‐101 Technical Report will include all exploration results since the last 43‐101 report which was issued on January 14, 2013. The update report will include high density drilling, geologic mapping, geophysics and a preliminary resource estimate.
The 2013 exploration consisted of more than 700 drill holes, 4000 RC drills and surface samples which were analyzed in several independent laboratories.
Preliminary Resource Estimates from a 5% fraction of the project gave 1.3 million tons of 0.7 g/t Au and 23 g/t Ag including 20% with an average grade of 1.9 g/t Au equivalent. Potential resources at productive shallow depths
are expected to be approximately 6,000,000 tons.
There are also surface geological and geophysical anomalies identified which, upon further evaluation and sampling, may present a strong potential for the existence of a porphyry copper target.
Ures Property
Mexus Gold US owns mineral rights to approximately 10,000 acres over 9 concessions near Hermosillo, Mexico. The concessions include the Ocho Hermanos, 370, San Ramon, Plan Osa, Edgar 1, Edgar 2, El Scorpio, Los Laureles, and Eusol. The concessions are located in Sonora State, Mexico approximately 80 KM NE of Hermosillo.
In the past year, Mexus has completed leach VAT testing and trenching including assaying with promising results. Historical assaying of the Ocho Hermanos concession has produced assays up to 1 Kg Ag per ton with 10 Gpt Au, 4% lead and 1% copper. One ton of mineralized materials holds 40 metals which is a complex ore. The Company is evaluating production procedures to economically process this ore.
Mexus has done limited drill hole testing of the Scorpio Project
concession with results up to 3% copper, 1.5 Gpt Au, and 60 Gpt Ag.
Non-Material Mining Properties
San Felix Mine Project
(formerly known as the Mexus-Trinidad Joint Venture)
In March, 2014, we sold our 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Atzek Mineral S.A. de C.V (“Atzek”). Atzek is currently in default of the sale agreement.
Effective January 13, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Mexus Gold Mining, S.A. de C.V., entered into a purchase agreement with Jesus Leopoldo Felix Mazon, Leonardo Elias Jaime Perez, and Elia Lizardi Perez, wherein we purchased a 50% interest in the “San Felix” mining site located in the La Alameda area of Caborca, State of Sonora, Mexico.   The remaining 50% of the site is owned jointly by Mar Holdings S.A. de C.V. and Marco Antonio Martinez Mora.  The San Felix mining site contains seven (7) concessions over an area of approximately 26,000 acres. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property for the San Felix Project of $75,000 because the payment of $500,000 installment
due on August 13, 2017 was not executed
in accordance with the purchase agreement pending the receipt of certain required instruments from the Grantor by the Company.
Other Operations
Cable Salvage Operation
The Company completed the first phase of its Cable Recovery Project in Alaskan waters. The cable which was recovered was smaller diameter cable which was excellent for testing the recovery equipment and vessels. The Company evaluated the project and conducted a mapping project and exploration activities in an attempt to identify larger cable.
21
At March 31, 2017, the Company ceased cable salvage operations in order to fully concentrate on Mexico operations.
Mergers and Acquisitions
We will routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities. An appropriate merger and acquisition opportunity must be accretive to the overall value of Mexus Gold US. Our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near-term production with a secondary focus on other resource-based opportunities. Potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties. Although our preference would be for candidates located in the United States and Mexico; Mexus Gold US will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptable.
Description of Mining Projects
The following properties are located in Mexico and owned by Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V., our wholly owned subsidiary:

Situated on the prospect area are caterpillars, haul trucks, maintenance trucks, power generators, pumps, tractor blade, truck mounted winch, water handling supplies and maintenance trailer with supplies. The prospect area is accessed from a state highway on existing roads. There is access to well water which is available for the current and future operations.
On January 5, 2011, Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. entered into a Purchase Agreement to purchase the Santa Elena Prospect, formerly known as the Caborca Project. The Santa Elena Prospect consists of 7,400 acres (3,000 hectares) about 50 kilometers northwest of the City of Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico. The Caborca Project lies on claims filed by the owners of the Santa Elena Ranch, which controls the surface rights over the project claims. The claims lie near 112 o
25' W, 31 o
7.5" N. These claims were visited near the end of January, 2011. On or about July 11, 2011, we acquired five additional claims surrounding the Santa Elena Prospect consisting of approximately 1,000 additional acres.
We have been unable to locate geologic maps of the area from the Government Geological Survey. However, pursuant to our investigation of the project, the claims were found to be underlain by an igneous complex. The rocks observed included many types of granitic rocks, exhibiting porphyrytic textures, gneissic and equigrannular textures. Quartz was variable. At times quartz "eyes" were observed, that is porphyrytic quartz which many workers consider
22
to be indicative of a porphyry environment. In other localities, no quartz was evident. When no quartz was present, the rock was equigrannular. Quartz veining was evident throughout the claim group. A mine was developed along a major quartz vein, called the Julio 2 Mine with the vein being called the Julio Vein.
There are multiple exploration targets on the Santa Elena Prospect. The two most important are the quartz stockwork zone and the Julio vein system. The first target will be the quartz stockwork zone area. A limited drilling program has been conducted and completed. Production testing has been completed resulting in the construction of the surface production and recovery facilities.
Access to the Santa Elena prospect is via dirt road approximately two miles west of paved highway Mexico 1 and approximately 34 miles northwest of the town of Caborca, Sonora, Mexico.

Exhibit 99.1 – PRELIMINARY REPORT AND FIRST STAGE MAPPING
Ures Property Prospects, being comprised of the following projects:
Ocho Hermanos – Guadalupe de Ures Project
The Guadalupe de Ures Project is accessed from Hermosillo by driving via good paved road for 60 kilometers to the town of Guadalupe de Ures and then for 15 kilometers over dirt roads to the prospects. A base camp has been established near the town of Guadalupe de Ures using mainly trailers for accommodation, workshops and kitchen facilities.

The Ocho Hermanos Project (also called the Guadalupe de Ures Project) consists of the “Ocho Hermanos” and "San Ramon" claims which are covered by the Sales and Production Contract dated the 4 th
day of July, 2009 between “Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV” (seller) and “Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V.”, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mexus Gold US (buyer). The Ocho Hermanos Claim consists of 34.9940 hectares (1 acre = 0.4047 hectares) or 86.4690 acres while the San Ramon Claim consists of 80 hectares (197.6773 acres).(Figure 4).
The initial term of the agreement was 5 years. During the term Mexus must pay 40% of the net revenue received for minerals produced to the seller. At the conclusion of the 5 years, the lease could be purchased for USD 50,000. Upon expiration on July 4, 2014, Mexus renewed the agreement with an indefinite term. The renewed agreement requires Mexus to pay $1,500 per month and 20% to the total proceeds upon a sale of the rights.
Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV is a duly constituted Mexican Company and as such can hold mining claims in Mexico.
FIGURE 3 - OCHO HERMANOS
PROJECT AREA CLAIM MAP
We did not perform any systematic sampling or any systematic drilling and because of this did not set up a formal QA/QC program. All of the samples were submitted to Certified Laboratories (ALS - Chemex in Hermosillo or American Assay in Reno, Nevada) which insert their own QA/QC samples/duplicates. Also the laboratories run duplicates and blanks from each batch fired. The sequence of events so far is the following:
We located a previously mined area with interesting values – Ocho Hermanos. Mexus began to submit characterization samples to the above noted assay laboratories, in order to determine the range of Au - Ag values present. Mexus then began an investigation into recovery options by using material taken from the areas with the better values.
The above work was completed before any systematic exploration was done because if no recovery method could be found relatively quickly, the project would move more slowly because of the lead time involved. Mexus
25
began work on an Environmental Impact Statement for the likely operational area (a total of 4 hectares to begin). In order to complete the EIS, figures for estimated tonnages for volume were submitted. To date, no suitable recovery method has been identified due primarily to the partial oxidation of the principally sulfide deposit.
The Environmental Permits run for 35 years so there is time for further investigation.
The main geologic feature of this project area is an apparent “manto” sulfide zone composed primarily of galena with some pyrite, arsenopyrite and possibly pyrrhotite. Above this zone there is an oxide zone composed of iron and lead oxides. The sulfides themselves are partially oxidized. Reconnaissance and characterization samples taken indicated sporadically high gold and silver values. The deposit occurs in shallow water sediments (principally quartzites, with some limestone and shales) and can be best characterized as a skarn type deposit due to the presence of intrusive rocks within 1 kilometer.
Given the complex nature of the sulfide deposit and the partial oxidization of the material (indicated by the presence of yellow colored lead oxides), a satisfactory recovery method has not yet been found. Consequently, at this time, no further systematic work beyond the initial reconnaissance and characterization sampling has been completed. The entire project was essentially put on hold until a suitable recovery method is found, which is a continuing effort and at this time is being pursued by a member of the faculty at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo. The faculty member teaches metallurgy and assay practices at the University. After a suitable recovery method has been identified, the process will need to be confirmed by a certified metallurgical testing laboratory.
The Environmental Permits detail all of the affected flora and fauna. The land is presently used for cattle grazing and the surface rights are owned by the community of Guadalupe de Ures. An agreement is in place with Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. for surface access and disturbance. The Environmental Permit concludes that no permanent damage or degradation of the present land use will result from the intended activity on the lands. At present, the Environmental Permits cover a total of 4 hectares - 3 hectares cover the initial site of the mineral as presently understood and 1 hectare is permitted for the erection of a suitable extraction plant.
No known contamination from past mining activities was found or is known to locals. The historic workings consisted of a few shallow adits and pits. In the course of obtaining the Environmental Permission the permit stipulated that properly lined ponds etc. must be used to prevent any potential surface or ground water contamination from any proposed activities.
Only separation is proposed to be conducted on site if found to be possible, while final metal recovery will be conducted at a properly licensed and certified metal refining facility. Current efforts to find suitable recovery methods are being conducted off site in a University laboratory. Up sizing the process, if found, will be completed by a licensed, certified metallurgical laboratory.
Figures of the proposed permitted sites are attached. These were extracted from the environmental permit
Application.

AREA DE EXTRACCION
370 Area Project
This zone is composed of a sedimentary sequence (limestone, quartzite, shale) intruded by dacite and diorite as well as rhyolite. The dacite exhibits argillic alterations as well as silicification (quartz veins). The entire area is well oxidized on the surface. This is an area of classic disseminated low grade gold and silver mineralization. Surface grab sample assays show 0.14 grams per ton to as high as 29.490 grams per ton gold. This area is an important area for potentially defining an open pit heap leach project.
28
El Scorpion Project Area
This area has several shear zones and veins which show copper and gold mineralization. Recent assays of an 84’ drill hole shows 1.750% per ton to .750% per ton of copper and 3.971 grams per ton to 0.072 grams per ton of gold. Another assay of rock sample from the area shows greater than 4.690% per ton copper. This land form distribution appears to be synonymous to the ideal porphyry deposit at Baja La Alumbrera, Argentina.
Los Laureles
Los Laureles is a vein type deposit mainly gold with some silver and copper. Recent assays from grab samples show gold values of 67.730 grams per ton gold, 38.4 grams per ton silver, 2,800 grams per ton copper.
As of the date of this Report, we have opened up old workings at the Los Laureles claim and have discovered a gold carrying vein running north and south into the mountain to the south.
The San Felix Mine Project
The San Felix mining site contains seven (7) concessions over an area of approximately 26,000 acres located in the La Alameda area of Caborca, Sonora, Mexico. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property for the San Felix Project of $75,000 because the requirement payment of $500,000 due on August 13, 2017 was not paid in accordance with the purchase agreement pending the receipt of certain required instruments from the Grantor by the Company.
Employees
We have one employee, Paul D. Thompson, and no other employees at this time in the United States of Mexico. Consultants with specific skills are utilized to assist with various aspects of the requirements of activities such as project evaluation, property management, due diligence, acquisition initiatives, corporate governance and property management. If we complete our planned activation of the operations of the Mexican mining properties, our total workforce will be approximately 20 persons. Mr. Paul D. Thompson is our sole officer and director.
Competition
We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties. There is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than Mexus Gold US. As a result, Mexus Gold US may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices.
Management of Mexus Gold US believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market.
Legal Proceedings
There are no legal proceedings to which Mexus Gold US or Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. is a party or of which any of our properties are the subject thereof.
Property Interests, Mining Claims and Risk
Property Interests and Mining Claims
Our exploration activities and operations in Mexico are subject to the rules and regulations of the United Mexican States. The Ministry (Secretariat) of Mining is the Federal Mexican Government ministry charged with controlling all mining matters. A concession is granted on the acceptance of an application which identifies the specific minerals to be mined and description of the exact location of the lands to be mined. The concession is subject to a semiannual tax to continue the concession in good standing. Usually, our arrangements with a concessionaire describe specific period payments to the concessionaire and a royalty on the minerals recovered from mining operations. Where prospective mineral properties are identified by the Company, some type of conveyance of the mining rights and property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Generally, these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on
29
the properties are brought into production. Other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements.
Reclamation
We may be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
While the Company, as of December 31, 2022, does not have a legal obligation associated with the disposal of certain chemicals used in its leaching process, the Company estimates it will incur costs up to $50,000 to neutralize those chemicals at the close of the leaching pond.
Risk
Our success depends on our ability to recover precious metals, process them, and successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The success of this process depends on the market prices of metals in relation to our costs of production. We may not always be able to generate a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals because we can only maintain a level of control over our costs and have no ability to control the market prices. The total cash costs of production at any location are frequently subject to great variation from year to year as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of ore grade or mineralized material production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body or deposit. In addition costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could adversely affect our ability to earn a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals. Our success depends on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of precious metals to recover our investment and operating costs.
Distribution Methods of the Products
The end product of our operations will usually be doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting of gold, silver and other precious metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% pure gold. Under the terms of refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee and our share of the refined product is delivered to a buyer for immediate sale or held by the Company for investment purposes.
General Market
The general market for gold has two principal categories, being fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals.
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts, including duration;
We do not have any designs or equipment which is copyrighted, trademarked or patented.
Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
Government Regulation
Mining operations and exploration activities in Mexico are subject to the Ministry of Mining federal laws and regulations which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that Mexus Gold US is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder any jurisdiction in which we will operate. We are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to Mexus Gold US with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
30
Environmental Regulation
Our gold projects are subject to various Mexican federal laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that the actions and operations of Mexus Gold US will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current Mexican federal laws and regulations where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
Research and Development
We do not foresee any immediate future research and development costs.
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
Our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The economics of our current projects consider the costs and expenses associated with our compliance policy.
Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico, where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
Results of Operations
The following management’s discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition of Mexus Gold US is for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. All amounts herein are in U.S. dollars.
Three months ended December 31, 2022 Compared with the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
We had a net loss during the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $276,888 compared to a net loss of $394,152 during the same period in 2021. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributable (i) a decrease in exploration costs of $89,732 (ii) a decrease in general and administration expense of $42,808
(iii) a decrease in interest expense of $34,011 (iv) an increase in gain on the sale of equipment of $94,800. The decrease in the net loss is partially offset by (i) an increase in stock-based compensation – consulting services of $65,840 (ii) an increase in the loss on settlement of debt of $8,040 (iii) a decrease in gain on the change in the fair value of and settlement of convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities of $13,403 and (iv) a decrease in the sale of gold of $59,889.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses decreased to $238,321 for three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $245,632 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in exploration costs and a decrease in general and administration expense.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had recoveries from the sale of gold of $0 compared to $59,889 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Sales of gold are reported as a reduction of exploration expense in the consolidated statement of operations since the Company is in the exploration stage.
Other Income (Expense)
We reported $38,067 of other expense during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $148,520 of other expense during the same period in 2021.
The change in other income (expense) is mainly attributable to a decrease in the gain on the change in the fair value of and settlement of convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities, increase in gain on sale of equipment and a decrease in interest expense.
31
Nine months ended December 31, 2022 Compared with the Nine months Ended December 31, 2021
We had a net loss during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $921,466 compared to a net loss of $2,087,717 during the same period in 2021. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributable (i) a decrease in exploration costs of $227,793 (ii) a decrease in general and administration expense of $63,824 (iii) a decrease in stock-based compensation – consulting services of $679,811 and (iv) a decrease in interest expense of $128,893 and (v) an increase in gain on the sale of equipment of $177,765. The decrease in the net loss is partially offset by (i) an increase in the loss on settlement of debt of $42,910 (ii) a decrease in gain on the change in the fair value of and settlement of convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities of $14,723 and (iii) a decrease in the sale of gold of $145.625.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses decreased to $710,054 for nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,535,857 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.  The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expense and stock-based expense – consulting services
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had recoveries from the sale of gold of $0 compared to $145,625 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Sales of gold are reported as a reduction of exploration expense in the consolidated statement of operations since the Company is in the exploration stage.
Other Income (Expense)
We reported $211,412 of other expense during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $551,860 of other expenses during the same period in 2021.
The change in other income (expense) is mainly attributable to a decrease in the gain on the change in the fair value of and settlement of convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities, increase in gain on sale of equipment and a decrease in interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 31, 2022, we had cash of $5,824 compared to cash of $7,174 on March 31, 2022.
Our property and equipment increased to $272,896 on December 31, 2022, compared to $221,457 at March 31, 2022. The increase in equipment is due to the purchase of equipment of $161,300, sale of equipment of $231,769, gain on sale of equipment of $177,765 and depreciation expense of $55,856 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Our mineral properties remained unchanged at $829,947 on December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022
Total assets increased to $1,108,667 on December 31, 2022, compared to $1,058,578 on March 31, 2022.  The majority of the increase in assets relates to the purchase of equipment of $161,300.
Our total liabilities decreased to $2,737,167 as of December 31, 2022, compared to $2,802,972 as of March 31, 2022.  The decrease in our total liabilities can be primarily attributed to a decrease in convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities.
Our working capital deficit on December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 is $2,731,343 and $2,795,798, respectively.
Our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is $434,119 and $509,497, respectively. Our net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $921,466 was the main contributing factor for our negative cash flow offset mainly by depreciation and amortization of $55,856, stock-based compensation – consulting services of $157,246 and non-cash interest expense of $532,642.
Our net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is $231,769 and $0, respectively. Cash proceeds are from the sale of equipment.
Our net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is $201,000 and $504,000, respectively, mainly due to issuance of convertible promissory notes and common stock.
32
The Company is dependent upon outside financing to continue operations. It is management’s plans to raise necessary funds through a private placement of its common stock to satisfy the capital requirements of the Company’s business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds, or that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, that the Company will successfully execute its business plan.
Going concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $921,466 and used cash in operating activities of $434,119, and on December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $39,179,958. On December 31, 2022, the Company is in the exploration stage. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued.  The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2022, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is dependent upon outside financing to continue operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management’s plans to raise necessary funds through a private placement of its common stock to satisfy the capital requirements of the Company’s business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds, or that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, that the Company will successfully execute its business plan.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to meet our obligations on a timely basis, and, to attain profitability.
Future goals
The Santa Elena Prospect (formerly known as Caborca Properties) has become our primary focus. The completion of the initial surface ground construction for a leaching production plant, being an expandable ore leaching pad, solution ponds and production recovery facility, has been tested and will be placed into production. The ore leaching pad has 35,000 tons of ore in place and will be increased in size on a continuing basis to realize the capacity of the production facility.
Therefore, our goal for the current year is to increase the cash flow of the Company’s operations through  (a) place the current facilities into full commercial production, (b) increase the mineralization of the ore pad from 1 gram per ton gold and 3 grams per ton silver and (c) increase the capacity of the leach pad.
The Company has now scheduled the installation of a crushing/milling recovery plant for the high grade Julio quartz deposit as a result of the values of the assay analysis from the deposit which range from .250 to 5.5 ounces of gold per ton.
Therefore, our goal for the current year is to increase the cash flow of the placer mining operation, continue the drilling program which began during 2011, initialize mining operations on the Julio quartz deposit while we conduct a thorough geological study by an independent geological firm of the future potential of other vein deposits located near the Julio deposit.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The majority of our operations are located in United States and most of our transactions are in the local currency.  We plan to continue exploration activities in Mexico and therefore we will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.  We do not trade in hedging instruments and a significant change in the foreign exchange rate between the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

ITEM 3.          QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.
ITEM 4(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our procedures were not designed to ensure that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management is currently evaluating the current disclosure controls and procedures in place to see where improvements can be made.
ITEM 5.          OTHER INFORMATION
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) we do not have an audit committee of the Board of Directors or a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors (ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines (iv) deficient design of our management information systems and information technology because the potential for unauthorized access to certain information systems and software applications existed during 2021 in several departments, including corporate accounting. Certain key controls for maintaining the overall integrity of systems and data processing were not properly designed and operating effectively.
To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2022: (i) appoint a financial expert and independent Directors to serve on the Board of Directors (ii) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties, ineffective risk management and deficient design of our management information systems and information technology; and (iii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i), (ii) and (iii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting, or any system we design or implement in the future, will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
34
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes in Internal Control
