ADM TRONICS UNLIMITED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED December 31, 2022 AND 2021
NOTE   1   - NATURE OF BUSINESS
ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Company” or “ADM”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on   November 24, 1969.  We are a manufacturing and engineering concern whose principal lines of business are the design, manufacture, and sale of electronics of our own products or on a contract manufacturing basis; the production and sale of chemical and antistatic products; and, research, development and engineering services.
Electronic equipment is manufactured in accordance with customer specifications on a contract basis. Our electronic device product line consists principally of proprietary devices used in diagnostics and therapeutics of humans and animals and electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. These products are sold to customers located principally in the United States. We are registered with the FDA as a contract manufacturing facility and we manufacture medical devices for customers in accordance with their designs and specifications. Our chemical product line is principally comprised of water-based chemical products used in the food packaging and converting industries, and anti-static conductive paints, coatings and other products. These products are sold to customers located in the United States, Australia, Asia and Europe. We also provide research, development, regulatory, and engineering services to customers. Our Sonotron Medical Systems, Inc. subsidiary (“Sonotron”) is involved in medical electronic therapeutic technology.
NOTE   2   - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by ADM pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) including Form  10 -Q and Regulation S- X.  The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the condensed financial position and operating results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and explanatory notes for the year ended March 31, 2022 as disclosed in our annual report on Form  10 -K for that year. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year then ended.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sonotron (the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and, accordingly, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates made by management include expected economic life and value of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance, write down of inventory, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and warranty reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
For certain of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with original maturities of  three  months or less when purchased. We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times,  may  exceed federally insured limits. We have  not  experienced any losses to date as a result of this policy. Cash and cash equivalents held in these accounts are currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to a maximum of $250,000 .  At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, approximately $ 820,000  and $ 887,000 , respectively, exceeded the FDIC limit.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management's best estimate of the amounts that will  not  be collected. Management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances that exceed the due date and estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that will be collected. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to expenses and a credit to a valuation allowance, based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
ELECTRONICS:
We recognize revenue from the sale of our electronic products when they are shipped to the purchaser. We offer a limited  90 -day warranty on our electronics products and contract manufacturing, and a limited 5-year warranty on our electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. Historically, the amount of warranty expense included in sales of our electronic products have been de minimis. We have  no  other post shipment obligations. For contract manufacturing, revenues are recognized after shipments of the completed products.
Amounts received from customers in advance of our satisfaction of applicable performance obligations are recorded as customer deposits. Such amounts are recognized as revenues when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Customer deposits of approximately $ 120,000  and $ 209,000  as of March 31, 2022 were recognized as revenues during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
CHEMICAL PRODUCTS:
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped to end users. Shipments to distributors are recognized as revenue when  no  right of return exists.
ENGINEERING SERVICES:
We provide certain engineering services, including research, development, quality control, and quality assurance services along with regulatory compliance services. We recognize revenue from engineering services over time as the applicable performance obligations are satisfied.
All revenue is recognized net of discounts.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost ( first -in,  first -out method) and net realizable value. Inventories that are expected to be sold within  one  operating cycle ( 1  year) are classified as a current asset. Inventories that are  not  expected to be sold within  1  year, based on historical trends, are classified as Inventories - long term portion. Obsolete inventory is written off based on prior and expected future usage.
Long-Term Inventory: Due to recent shortages of materials relating to supply chain and COVID issues, when an item the Company believes will be used in the future, even beyond the current fiscal year, becomes available, it will purchase as many items as management deems necessary to fulfill future orders.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
We record our property and equipment at historical cost. We expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation is provided for by the straight-line method over  five  to  seven  years, the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $ 6,184  and $ 21,216  for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 7,604  and $ 22,392  for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income/loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential shares had been issued and if the additional shares were dilutive. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of net earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
There were  no  anti-dilutive instruments in force during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Per share basic and diluted (loss) amounted to $ 0.00  and $( 0.00 ) and $ 0.00  and $( 0.00 ) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
LEASES
In  February 2016,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance which changed financial reporting as it relates to leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, for the lease term. The Company adopted this guidance as of  April 1, 2019,  using the modified retrospective approach which allowed it to initially apply the guidance as of the adoption date. The Company elected the package of practical expedients available under the new standard, which allowed the Company to forgo a reassessment of ( 1 ) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, ( 2 ) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and ( 3 ) the initial direct costs for any existing leases.
The Company made a policy election to recognize short-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company defines a short-term lease as a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of  twelve  months or less and does  not  contain an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lease is reasonably certain to exercise. Related variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
The Company's lease agreement contains related non-lease components (e.g. taxes, etc.). The Company separates lease components and non-lease components for all underlying asset classes.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain amounts in the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications have  no  effect on previously reported net loss.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments  —  ASU  2016-13”). The new standard adjusts the accounting for assets held at amortized cost basis, including marketable securities accounted for as available for sale, and trade receivables. The standard eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For public entities except smaller reporting companies, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which deferred the effective date for non-public entities and smaller reporting companies to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is allowed. The Company expects to adopt this guidance effective April 1, 2023, and it is currently evaluating the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company is assessing this guidance to determine what modifications to existing credit estimation processes may be required. The new guidance is complex and management is evaluating preliminary output from models that have been developed during this evaluative phase. In addition, future levels of allowances will also reflect new requirements to include estimated credit losses on investment securities classified as held-to-maturity, if any. It has been generally assumed that the conversion from the incurred loss model, required under current GAAP, to the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology (as required upon implementation of this Update) will, more likely than not, result in increases to the allowances for credit losses. However, the amount of any change in the allowance for credit losses resulting from the new guidance will ultimately be impacted by the provisions of this guidance as well as by loan and trade receivable composition and asset quality at the adoption date, and economic conditions and forecasts at the time of adoption. The cumulative impact of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the changes to the allowance for loan and trade receivable losses, that will be required upon the implementation of the CECL methodology, cannot be estimated at this time.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. The Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

NOTE   9  –  PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM (PPP)   LOAN
In    May 2020,  the Company obtained funding through the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of $ 381,000 .  In    February 2021,  a  second  PPP loan was obtained in the amount of $ 332,542 , for a total of $ 713,542 .  The loans will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities, with at least  60%  being used for payroll.  The Company did use the funds for these expenses during the year ended    March 31, 2021.  The Company applied for loan forgiveness of both PPP loans. On   September 7, 2021,  the Company received approval from the SBA for $ 361,275  of PPP loan forgiveness. On  December 21, 2021,  the Company received approval from the Bank for $ 332,542 . This amount was recorded as Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection loan in the accompanying condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
The unforgiven portion of the first PPP loan is $ 19,725 , which was converted to a term loan payable in equal installments of principal plus interest at  1 % with a maturity date of   May 15, 2025 .  No collateral or personal guarantees is required for the loan. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance is $ 13,001 .
NOTE   10  –  LINE OF CREDIT
On June 15, 2018, the Company obtained an unsecured revolving line of credit, with a limit of $ 400,000 . The line expires  May 15, 2023 , renewing automatically every year.  The Company is required to make monthly interest payments, at a rate of  3.87 % as of June 30, 2022. Any unpaid principal will be due upon maturity.  At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the outstanding balance was $ 111,973  and $ 334,760 , respectively.
NOTE   11  –  WARRANT LIABILITY
On July 2, 2021, ADM entered into a consulting agreement. The agreement granted a consultant a warrant to purchase up to  3,500,000  shares of the Company's par value common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.17  per share for the first  twelve  months of the agreement and $ 0.20  per share for the second  twelve  months of the agreement.
During the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2022, we identified an error relating to the accounting treatment of the initial warrant liability in July of 2021 that was originally valued at approximately $ 288,000  and was subsequently revalued at March 31, 2022 for a value of approximately $ 182,000 . The error caused additional paid in capital to be understated by approximately $ 288,000 , warrant liability to be overstated by approximately $ 182,000 , prepaid expenses to be understated by approximately $ 181,000 , and net loss to be overstated by approximately $ 75,000  as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022.
We concluded the impact on the interim financial statements was immaterial and corrected the balances as of June 30, 2022.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Company had reduced revenues in the electronic and chemical segments as a result of the Covid pandemic. In the electronic segment certain orders of medical devices manufactured by the Company were reduced or delayed due to the cessation of elective surgeries during the pandemic and generally reduced activities by customers. In the chemical segment certain of the Company’s water-based industrial coatings and adhesives orders were reduced due to some customers having shutdowns or reduced activities during the pandemic. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive actions to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact on us, including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows.

Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $233,508. The increase is a result of increased sales of $95,899 in the Engineering segment, $137,543 in the Electronics segment and $66 in the Chemical segment.
Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $149,365. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from increased sales in Electronics and Engineering sales.
Revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $721,967. The increase is a result of increased sales of $31,553 in the Chemical segment, $672,434 in the Electronics segment and $17,980 in the Engineering segment.
Gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $425,811. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from increased sales in Electronics and Chemical sales.
We are highly dependent upon certain customers. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 50% of our net revenue. Net revenues from foreign customers for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $80,465 or 8%.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for 66% of our net revenue. Net revenues from foreign customers for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was $80,358 or 11%.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 45% of our net revenue. Net revenues from foreign customers for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $292,036 or 10%.
The complete loss of or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any of our customers could cause a material and adverse change in our revenues and operating results.
Income from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $92,753 compared to loss from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of ($416,172).
Other income decreased $329,761 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is mainly attributable to the PPP forgiveness of $361,275 in 2021.
Other income decreased $694,576 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is mainly attributable to the PPP forgiveness of $361,275 in 2021.
The foregoing resulted in net income before provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $93,771 and $155,148 respectively. Earnings per share were $0.00 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $997,685 as compared to $1,038,498 at March 31, 2022. The $40,813 decrease was primarily the result of cash provided in operations during the nine-month period in the amount of $215,022 and cash used in financing activities of $255,835. Our cash will continue to be used for increased marketing costs, and increased production labor costs all in an attempt to increase our revenue, as well as increased expenditures for our internal R&D.  We expect to have enough cash to fund operations for the next twelve months.
Below is a summary of our cash flow for the nine-month ending periods indicated:

Future Sources of Liquidity:
We expect that growth with profitable customers and continued focus on new customers will enable us to generate cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2023.
Based on current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $997,685 as of December 31, 2022, and other potential sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. Our ability to meet these requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Net cash provided by operating activities was $215,022 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net cash used by operating activities of $374,942 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in net operating assets of $43,794, offset by a decrease in net operating liabilities of $68,391, offset by net income of $155,148 write-off of inventories of $54,692, depreciation and amortization of $63,737, and stock based compensation of $33,310 (see Note 12 Warrant Liability), and non-cash interest expense of $20,320.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
No cash was provided for or used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used by financing activities was $255,835 due to a net borrowing and payments in the line of credit of $222,697, a decrease in due to stockholder of $29,104 and repayments on the PPP loan of $4,034.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents – For financial statement purposes, the Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at inception. The Company deposits cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions and believes that any amounts in excess of insurance limitations to be at minimal risk. Cash and cash equivalents held at these accounts are currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to a maximum of $250,000. At December 31, 2022, approximately $748,000 exceeded the FDIC limit.
Our sales are materially dependent on a small group of customers, as noted in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We monitor our credit risk associated with our receivables on a routine basis. We also maintain credit controls for evaluating and granting customer credit.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in Ru1e 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarterly and year to date period ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting which materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
The determination that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022, is a result of:
a. Deficiencies in Internal Control Structure Environment. During the current year, the Company’s focus was on expanding their customer base to initiate revenue production.
b. Inadequate staffing and supervision within the accounting operations of our company. The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents the Company from segregating duties within its internal control system. The inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews.  The Company’s plan is to expand its accounting operations as the business of the Company expands.
The Company believes that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022 and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, notwithstanding the material weaknesses we identified.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
