Exhibits 150 Signatures FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements.” Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future—including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results—are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, and those described from time to time in reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this report involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including statements concerning: • our, or our portfolio companies’, future operating results; • our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; • the return or impact of current or future investments that we expect to make; • our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; • the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; • the impact of global events outside of our control, including the consequences of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, on our and our portfolio companies’ business and the global economy;
• uncertainty surrounding inflation and the financial stability of the United States, Europe, and China; • the financial condition of, and ability of our current and prospective portfolio companies to, achieve their objectives; • difficulty in obtaining financing or raising capital, especially in the current credit and equity environment, and the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our and our portfolio companies’ business; • the level, duration and volatility of prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, magnified by the current turmoil in the credit markets; • the phase-out and the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate on our operating results; • adverse developments in the availability of desirable loan and investment opportunities whether they are due to competition, regulation or otherwise; • a compression of the yield on our investments and the cost of our liabilities, as well as the level of leverage available to us; • the impact of changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies; • our regulatory structure and tax treatment, including our ability to operate as a business development company and a regulated investment company; • the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; • the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; • the ability of our investment adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; • the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; • authoritative generally accepted accounting principles or policy changes from such standard-setting bodies as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the New York Stock Exchange LLC, and other authorities that we are subject to, as well as their counterparts in any foreign jurisdictions where we might do business; and • any of the other risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify herein or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. 3 PART I Item 1.

The securities in which Prospect has invested were acquired in transactions that were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). These securities may be resold only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. (2) Fair value is determined by or under the direction of our Board of Directors. Unless otherwise indicated by endnote 47 below, all of our investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs. In accordance with ASC 820, such investments are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. See Notes 2 and 3 within the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. (3) Security, or a portion thereof, is held by Prospect Capital Funding LLC (“PCF”), our wholly owned subsidiary and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, and is pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility and such security is not available as collateral to our general creditors (see Note 4). The fair value of the investments held by PCF at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were $ 2,605,903

33.5 % and

Structured Note,” or “SSN”. The SSN investments are entitled to recurring distributions which are generally equal to the excess cash flow generated from the underlying investments after payment of the contractual payments to debt holders and fund expenses. The current estimated yield, calculated using amortized cost, is based on the current projections of this excess cash flow taking into account assumptions which have been made regarding expected prepayments, losses and future reinvestment rates. These assumptions are periodically reviewed and adjusted. Ultimately, the actual yield may be higher or lower than the estimated yield if actual results differ from those used for the assumptions.
(6) On December 28, 2022, we provided $ 15,000
of additional Second Lien Term Loans and $ 30,000

0 % as expected future cash flows are anticipated to not be sufficient to repay the investment at cost. If the expected investment proceeds increase, there is a potential for future investment income from the investment. Distributions, once received, will be recognized as return of capital, and when called, any remaining unamortized investment costs will be written off if the actual distributions are less than the amortized investment cost. To the extent that the cost basis of the SSN is fully recovered, any future distributions will be recorded as realized gains.

Organization In this report, the terms “Prospect”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” mean Prospect Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.
Prospect is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). We were organized on April 13, 2004, and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004.
On May 15, 2007, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Capital Funding LLC (“PCF”), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Our wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Small Business Lending, LLC (“PSBL”) was formed on January 27, 2014, and purchased small business whole loans from online small business loan originators, including On Deck Capital, Inc. (“OnDeck”). On September 30, 2014, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Prospect Yield Corporation, LLC (“PYC”) and effective October 23, 2014, PYC holds a portion of our collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes (“SSNs”). Each of these subsidiaries have been consolidated since operations commenced.
We consolidate certain of our wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us in order to facilitate our investment strategy. The following companies are included in our consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as the “Consolidated Holding Companies”: CP Holdings of Delaware LLC (“CP Holdings”); Credit Central Holdings of Delaware, LLC; Energy Solutions Holdings Inc.; First Tower Holdings of Delaware LLC (“First Tower Delaware”); MITY Holdings of Delaware Inc.; Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC; NMMB Holdings, Inc. (“NMMB Holdings”); NPH Property Holdings, LLC (“NPH”); Prospect Opportunity Holdings I, Inc. (“POHI”); SB Forging Company, Inc. (“SB Forging”); STI Holding, Inc.; UTP Holdings Group Inc. (“UTP Holdings”); Valley Electric Holdings I, Inc. (“Valley Holdings I”); and Valley Electric Holdings II, Inc. (“Valley Holdings II”). We are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. (“Prospect Capital Management” or the “Investment Adviser”). Prospect Administration LLC (“Prospect Administration” or the “Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to identify investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows for investment. Note 2.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q, ASC 946,
Financial Services—Investment Companies
(“ASC 946”), and Articles 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect, PCF, PSBL, PYC, and the Consolidated Holding Companies. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial results of our non-substantially wholly-owned holding companies and operating portfolio company investments are not consolidated in the financial statements. Any operating companies owned by the Consolidated Holding Companies are not consolidated. 46 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. All cash balances are maintained with high credit quality financial institutions which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Cash held at financial institutions, at times, has exceeded the FDIC insured limit. The Company has not incurred any losses on these accounts, and the credit risk exposure is mitigated by the financial strength of the banking institutions where the amounts are held. Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the presentation of prior consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the presentation as of and for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Refer to Note 12.
Income Taxes . Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, and gains and losses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, creditworthiness of the issuers of our investment portfolio and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ, and these differences could be material.
Investment Classification
We are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, “Control Investments” are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses a beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, “Affiliate Investments” are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. “Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments” are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.
As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, our qualifying assets as a percentage of total assets, stood at
81.27 % and
80.64 %, respectively. Investment Transactions
Investments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Specifically, we record all security transactions on a trade date basis. We determine the fair value of our investments on a quarterly basis (as discussed in
Investment Valuation
below), with quarter over quarter fluctuations in fair value reflected as a net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations .
Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. Amounts for investments traded but not yet settled are reported in Due to Broker or Due from Broker, in the
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities .
As of December 31, 2022, we have no assets going through foreclosure.
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency amounts are translated into
US Dollars (USD)
on the following basis:
i. fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities—at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and
ii. purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses—at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such investment transactions, income or expenses.
47 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) We do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held or disposed of during the period. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and net change in unrealized gains or losses from investments in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Investment Risks
Our investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:
Market Risk
Market risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.
Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.
Prepayment Risk
Many of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.
Structured Credit Related Risk
CLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.
Foreign Currency
Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.
Other Risks Political developments, including civil conflicts and war, sanctions or other measures by the United States or other governments, natural disasters, public health crises and other events outside the Company's control can directly or indirectly have a material adverse impact on the Company and our portfolio companies. 48 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Investment Valuation
As a BDC, and in accordance with the 1940 Act, we fair value our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with any unrealized gains and losses reflected in net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations on our
Consolidated Statement of Operations . To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC 820”), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted.
ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:
Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.
Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.
Our Board of Directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio. These procedures are detailed below.
Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations.
For most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, due to factors such as volume and frequency of price quotes, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below.
1. Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors.
2. The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations for each investment based on their own independent assessments and issue their report.
3. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment.
4. The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee.
Our non-CLO investments that are classified as
Level 3
are valued utilizing a yield technique, enterprise value (“EV”) technique, net asset value technique, asset recovery technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company’s securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., “waterfall” allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant transactions. The asset recovery technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company’s assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single
49 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.
In applying these methodologies, additional factors that we consider in valuing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company’s ability to make payments; the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal market; and enterprise values, among other factors.
Our investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment.  In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk. Convertible Notes
We have recorded the Convertible Notes at their contractual amounts and at issuance, we determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Unsecured Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging . The adoption of ASU 2020-06 (defined below under
Recent Accounting Pronouncements ) did not impact the accounting for the Convertible Notes.
See Note 5 for further discussion on our Convertible Notes outstanding.
Revenue Recognition
Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts and market discounts are capitalized and accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans using the effective interest method or straight-line, as applicable, and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon a prepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums, original issue discount, or market discounts are recorded as interest income.
Loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management’s judgment of the collectability of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management’s judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of December 31, 2022, approximately
0.5 % of our total assets at fair value are in non-accrual status.
Some of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.
50 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Interest income from investments in Subordinated Structured Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) and “equity” class of security of securitized trust is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40,
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets . We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO and securitized trust equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically.
ASC Topic 606
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC Topic 606”) does not apply to the above revenue associated with financial instruments and interest income.
Other income consists of structuring fees, amendment fees, overriding royalty interests, revenue receipts related to net profit interests, deal deposits, administrative agent fees, and other miscellaneous receipts, which are recognized as revenue when received. Structuring fees, and certain other amendment or advisory fees, are derived from us providing specific transaction or advisory related services to our portfolio companies. We evaluate and make conclusions on the appropriateness of taking fees immediately into revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606. Our fees are generally earned in response to us providing advisory assistance to our portfolio companies for capital structuring services (amendments where applicable). These fees are generated from new originations as well as from follow-on investments and amendments to existing portfolio companies. These fees are fixed based on contractual terms, are generally only available to us as a result of PSEC’s investments, are paid at the closing, are generally non-recurring and non-refundable and are recognized as revenue upon completion of our performance obligations (closing of transaction, execution of amendments, etc.).
See Note 10
Other Income .
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Each distribution received from limited liability company (“LLC”) and limited partnership (“LP”) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient current or accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded dividend income of $ 2,217
and $ 5,704 , respectively, and return of capital distributions of $ 24
and $ 0 , respectively.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded dividend income of $ 5,118
and $ 6,971 , respectively, and return of capital distributions of $ 4,760
and $ 0 , respectively.
Federal and State Income Taxes
We have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, we have made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.
If we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, we do not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2022 calendar year. Thus, we have not accrued any excise tax for this period.
If we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate
51 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.
We follow ASC 740,
Income Taxes
(“ASC 740”). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of December 31, 2022, we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management’s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. Our federal tax returns for the tax years ended August 31, 2019 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our Board of Directors quarterly and is generally based upon our management’s estimate of our future taxable earnings. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.
Our distributions may exceed our earnings, and therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may be a return of the money originally invested and represent a return of capital distribution to shareholders for tax purposes. Financing Costs
We record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation for our Revolving Credit Facility. Debt issuance costs and origination discounts related to our Convertible Notes and Public Notes are presented net against the outstanding principal of the respective instrument and amortized as part of interest expense using the effective interest method over the stated life of the respective instrument. Debt issuance costs and origination discounts related to our Prospect Capital InterNotes® (collectively, with our Convertible Notes and Public Notes, our “Unsecured Notes”) are net against the outstanding principal amount of our Prospect Capital InterNotes® and are amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated maturity of the respective note. In the event that we modify or extinguish our debt before maturity, we follow the guidance in ASC 470-50,
Modification and Extinguishments
(“ASC 470-50”). For modifications to or exchanges of our Revolving Credit Facility, any unamortized deferred costs relating to lenders who are not part of the new lending group are expensed. For extinguishments of our Unsecured Notes, any unamortized deferred costs are deducted from the carrying amount of the debt in determining the gain or loss from the extinguishment.
Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a direct deduction to the respective Unsecured Notes (see Notes 5, 6, and 7).
We may record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid expenses. These expenses consist principally of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred. These prepaid expenses are charged to capital upon the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering or charged to expense if no offering is completed.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there are no prepaid expenses related to registration expenses and all amounts incurred have been expensed.
Per Share Information
In accordance with ASC 946, senior equity securities, such as preferred stock, are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. Net asset value per share also excludes the effects of assumed conversion of outstanding convertible securities, regardless of whether their conversion would have a diluting effect. Therefore, our net asset value is presented on the basis of per common share outstanding as of the applicable period end.
52 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) We compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260”). Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding using the if-converted method for our Convertible Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes (together, “convertible instruments”). Diluted earnings per share excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Preferred Stock In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A, the Company’s Preferred Stock (as defined in “Note 9. Equity Offerings, Offering Expenses, and Distributions”) has been classified in temporary equity on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities
beginning the period ended September 30, 2021 due to the possibility of a Change of Control triggering event that could lead to redemption outside of the Company’s control. The Preferred Stock issued as temporary equity is recorded net of offering costs and issuance costs.
5.50 % Preferred Stock issued prior to the issuance of our
5.35 % Series A Preferred Stock has a carrying value on our
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
equal to liquidation value per share. Accrued and unpaid dividends relating to the Preferred Stock are included in the preferred stock carrying value on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities . Dividends declared on the Preferred Stock are included in preferred stock dividends on the
Statement of Operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024, as updated by ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848
in December 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
On July 1, 2022, we adopted, ASU 2020-06,
Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity
(“ASU 2020-06”) ,  which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share. We adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective transition method. As a result, we are now required to calculate diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method for our convertible instruments. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 11.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets per Common Share
for additional information on the effects of the adoption of ASU 2020-06. In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. Rule 2a-5 establishes a consistent, principles-based framework for boards of directors to use in creating their own specific processes in order to determine fair values in good faith. The effective date for compliance with Rule 2a-5 was September 8, 2022. Adoption of Rule 2a-5 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures as our board of directors has chosen to continue to determine fair value in good faith. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, which amends
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”) . ASU 202203 clarifies guidance for fair value measurement of an equity security subject to a contractual sale restriction and establishes new disclosure requirements for such equity securities. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on their financial statements. 53 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Note 3.

Investments for which market quotations are readily available must be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. These investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of debt investments specifically classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy are generally valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We generally value over-the-counter securities by using the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers during the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not readily available, and are therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used. In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model.
Our portfolio consists of residual interests and debt investments in CLOs, which involve a number of significant risks. CLOs are typically very highly levered (10 - 14 times), and therefore the residual interest tranches that we invest in are subject to a higher degree of risk of total loss. In particular, investors in CLO residual interests indirectly bear risks of the underlying loan investments held by such CLOs. We generally have the right to receive payments only from the CLOs, and generally do not have direct rights against the underlying borrowers or the entity that sponsored the CLOs. While the CLOs we target generally enable the investor to acquire interests in a pool of senior loans without the expenses associated with directly holding the same investments, the prices of indices and securities underlying our CLOs will rise or fall. These prices (and, therefore, the prices of the CLOs) will be influenced by the same types of political and economic events that affect issuers of securities and capital markets generally. The failure by a CLO investment in which we invest to satisfy financial covenants, including with respect to adequate collateralization and/or interest coverage tests, could lead to a reduction in its payments to us. In the event that a CLO
61 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) fails certain tests, holders of debt senior to us would be entitled to additional payments that would, in turn, reduce the payments we would otherwise be entitled to receive. Separately, we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting CLO or any other investment we may make. If any of these occur, it could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. The interests we have acquired in CLOs are generally thinly traded or have only a limited trading market. CLOs are typically privately offered and sold, even in the secondary market. As a result, investments in CLOs may be characterized as illiquid securities. In addition to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, CLO residual interests carry additional risks, including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) our investments in CLO tranches will likely be subordinate to other senior classes of note tranches thereof; and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the CLO investment or unexpected investment results. Our net asset value may also decline over time if our principal recovery with respect to CLO residual interests is less than the cost of those investments. Our CLO investments and/or the CLOs’ underlying senior secured loans may prepay more quickly than expected, which could have an adverse impact on our value. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. An increase in LIBOR would materially increase the CLO’s financing costs. Since most of the collateral positions within the CLOs have LIBOR floors, there may not be corresponding increases in investment income (if LIBOR increases but stays below the LIBOR floor rate of such investments) resulting in materially smaller distribution payments to the residual interest investors. We hold more than a 10% interest in certain foreign corporations that are treated as controlled foreign corporations (“CFC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including our residual interest tranche investments in CLOs). Therefore, we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporations in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for that tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains). We are required to include such deemed distributions from a CFC in our taxable income and we are required to distribute at least 90% of such income to maintain our RIC status, regardless of whether or not the CFC makes an actual distribution during such year. If we acquire shares in “passive foreign investment companies” (“PFICs”) (including residual interest tranche investments in CLOs that are PFICs), we may be subject to federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend to our stockholders. Certain elections may be available to mitigate or eliminate such tax on excess distributions, but such elections (if available) will generally require us to recognize our share of the PFIC’s income for each year regardless of whether we receive any distributions from such PFICs. We must nonetheless distribute such income to maintain our status as a RIC. Legislation known as FATCA and regulations thereunder impose a withholding tax of 30% on payments of U.S. source interest and dividends, to certain non-U.S. entities, including certain non-U.S. financial institutions and investment funds, unless such non-U.S. entity complies with certain reporting requirements regarding its United States account holders and its United States owners. Most CLOs in which we invest will be treated as non-U.S. financial entities for this purpose, and therefore will be required to comply with these reporting requirements to avoid the 30% withholding. If a CLO in which we invest fails to properly comply with these reporting requirements, it could reduce the amounts available to distribute to residual interest and junior debt holders in such CLO vehicle, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. If we are required to include amounts in income prior to receiving distributions representing such income, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices management would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. The significant unobservable input used to value our investments based on the yield technique and discounted cash flow technique is the market yield (or applicable discount rate) used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which includes both future principal and interest/dividend payments. Increases or decreases in the market yield (or applicable discount rate) would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value measurement. Management and the independent valuation firms consider the following factors when selecting market yields or discount rates: risk of default, rating of the investment and comparable company investments, and call provisions. 62 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) The significant unobservable inputs used to value our investments based on the EV analysis may include market multiples of specified financial measures such as EBITDA, net income, or book value of identified guideline public companies, implied valuation multiples from precedent M&A transactions, and/or discount rates applied in a discounted cash flow technique. The independent valuation firm identifies a population of publicly traded companies with similar operations and key attributes to that of the portfolio company. Using valuation and operating metrics of these guideline public companies and/or as implied by relevant precedent transactions, a range of multiples of the latest twelve months EBITDA, or other measure such as net income or book value, is typically calculated. The independent valuation firm utilizes the determined multiples to estimate the portfolio company’s EV generally based on the latest twelve months EBITDA of the portfolio company (or other meaningful measure). Increases or decreases in the multiple would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in EV which would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value measurement of the debt of controlled companies and/or equity investment, as applicable. In certain instances, a discounted cash flow analysis may be considered in estimating EV, in which case, discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital and application of the capital asset pricing model may be utilized. The significant unobservable input used to value our private REIT investments based on the discounted cash flow analysis is the discount rate and terminal capitalization rate applied to projected cash flows of the underlying properties. Increases or decreases in the discount rate and terminal capitalization rate would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value measurement. Changes in market yields, discount rates, capitalization rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value measurement of certain of our investments. Generally, an increase in market yields, discount rates or capitalization rates, or a decrease in EBITDA (or other) multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value measurement of certain of our investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we
could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the currently assigned valuations.

As a result, the fair value of our investment in West Marine decreased to $ 11,233
as of December 31, 2022, a discount of $ 11,490
to its amortized cost, compared to the unrealized discount of $ 1,119
recorded at June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the valuation methodology for Shutterfly, LLC (“Shutterfly”) changed from market quotes to a combination of market quotes and the yield method, due to a decrease in average liquidity of market quotes.

As a result, our investment in Town & Country First Lien Term Loan is $ 164,887
as of December 31, 2022, which is equal to its amortized cost. The fair value at June 30, 2022 also equaled its amortized cost. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the valuation methodology for Vision Solutions, Inc (“Precisely”) changed from a combination of the yield method, market quotes, and inclusion of the price observed in a minority equity transaction for the Precisely investment itself (given the recency and inclusion of outside investors in the transaction at June 30, 2022) to rely solely on the yield method, since market quotes for the Second Lien Term Loan were less active in the current period and the noted transaction was no longer relevant.
As a result of decreased market quotes of the Precisely First Lien Term Loan, which were used to derive the relative value of the Second Lien Term Loan, the fair value of our investment in Precisely Second Lien Term Loan decreased to $ 70,507
as of December 31, 2022, a discount of $ 8,767
from its amortized cost, compared to the $ 896

Unconsolidated Significant Subsidiaries Our investments are generally in small and mid-sized companies in a variety of industries. In accordance with Regulation S-X 3-09 and Regulation S-X 4-08(g), we must determine which of our unconsolidated controlled portfolio companies are considered “significant subsidiaries,” if any, as defined in Rule 1-02(w)(2) for BDC’s and closed end investment companies. Regulation S-X 3-09 requires separate audited financial statements of an unconsolidated subsidiary in an annual report. Regulation S-X 4-08(g) requires summarized financial information in an annual report.
Pursuant to Regulation S-X 10-01(b),
Interim Financial Statements , summarized interim income statement information is required for an unconsolidated subsidiary within a quarterly report if the unconsolidated subsidiary would otherwise require separate audited financial statements within an annual report pursuant to Regulation S-X 3-09.

Revolving Credit Facility On May 15, 2007, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, Prospect Capital Funding LLC (“PCF”), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Since origination of the revolving credit facility, we have renegotiated the terms and extended the commitments of the revolving credit facility several times. Most recently, effective September 15, 2022, we completed an extension and upsizing of the revolving credit facility (the “2022 Facility” or the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The lenders have extended commitments of $ 1,701,500
as of December 31, 2022. The 2022 Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $ 2,000,000
in the aggregate. The extension and upsizing of the Revolving Credit Facility extended the maturity date to September 15, 2027 and the revolving period through September 15, 2026, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due. The Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions pertaining to the geographic and industry concentrations of funded loans, maximum size of funded loans, interest rate payment frequency of funded loans, maturity dates of funded loans and minimum equity requirements, among other items. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, violation of which could result in the early termination of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility.
Interest on borrowings under the 2022 Facility is one-month SOFR plus
205
basis points. Additionally, the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either
40
basis points if more than 60% of the credit facility is drawn,
70
basis points if more than 35% and an amount less than or equal to 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or
150
basis points if an amount less than or equal to 35% of the credit facility is drawn. The 2022 Facility requires us to pledge assets as collateral in order to borrow under the credit facility.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) and average outstanding borrowings for the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows:
Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average stated interest rate 5.64 % 2.14 % 4.94   % 2.13   % Average outstanding balance 971,799   468,063   968,986   452,422   68 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had $ 805,571
and $ 660,536 , respectively, available to us for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $ 754,305
and $ 839,464
outstanding borrowings as of the respective balance sheet dates. As of December 31, 2022, the investments, including cash and cash equivalents, used as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $ 2,627,529 , which represents
33.5 % of our total investments, including cash and cash equivalents. These assets are held and owned by PCF, a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, and, as such, these investments are not available to our general creditors. As additional eligible investments are transferred to PCF and pledged under the Revolving Credit Facility, PCF will generate additional availability up to the current commitment amount of $ 1,701,500 . The release of any assets from PCF requires the approval of the facility agent.
In connection with the origination and amendments of the Revolving Credit Facility, we incurred $ 24,314
of fees, all of which are being amortized over the term of the facility. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $ 14,895
and $ 10,801 , respectively, of the fees remain to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded
$ 15,769
and $ 5,133 , respectively, of interest costs, unused fees and amortization of financing costs on the Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded $ 27,496
and $ 9,702 , respectively, of interest costs, unused fees and amortization of financing costs on the Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense. Note 5.

If a holder converts the Convertible Notes after a record date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding interest payment date, the holder will receive shares of our common stock based on the conversion formula described above, a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest through the record date in the normal course and a separate cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest from the record date to the conversion date.
No holder of Convertible Notes will be entitled to receive shares of our common stock upon conversion to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become, directly or indirectly, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 5.0% of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time. The 5.0% limitation shall no longer apply following the effective date of any fundamental change. We will not issue any shares in connection with the conversion or redemption of the Convertible Notes which would equal or exceed 20% of the shares outstanding at the time of the transaction in accordance with NASDAQ rules.
Subject to certain exceptions, holders may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or part of their Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon a fundamental change that constitutes a non-stock change of control we will also pay holders an amount in cash equal to the present value of all remaining interest payments (without duplication of the foregoing amounts) on such Convertible Notes through and including the maturity date.

(2) The asset coverage ratio for a class of secured senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by secured senior securities representing indebtedness. The asset coverage ratio for a class of unsecured senior securities representing indebtedness is inclusive of all senior securities representing indebtedness. With respect to the senior securities represented by indebtedness, this asset coverage ratio is multiplied by $1,000 to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing preferred stock is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by the sum of all senior securities representing indebtedness and the involuntary liquidation preference of senior securities representing preferred stock (the “Total Asset Coverage Ratio”). With respect to the Preferred Stock, the Asset Coverage Per Unit figure is expressed in terms of a dollar amount per share of outstanding Preferred Stock (based on a per share liquidation preference of $ 25 ). The rows reflecting “All Senior Securities” reflect the Total Asset Coverage Ratio as the asset coverage ratio, and express Asset Coverage Per Unit as per $1,000 of indebtedness or per $1,000 of Preferred Stock liquidation preference. (3) This column is inapplicable, except for the 6.95% 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Notes, and the 5.35% Preferred Stock. The average market value per unit is calculated as an average of quarter-end prices. With respect to the senior securities represented by indebtedness, the market value is shown per $1,000 of indebtedness. (4) We repaid the outstanding principal amount of the 2015 Notes on December 15, 2015. (5) We repaid the outstanding principal amount of the 2016 Notes on August 15, 2016. (6) We repaid the outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes on October 15, 2017. (7) We repaid the outstanding principal amount of the 2018 Notes on March 15, 2018. (8) We redeemed the 6.95% 2022 Notes on May 15, 2015. (9) We repaid the outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Notes on January 15, 2019.

(12) While we do not consider commitments to fund under revolving arrangements to be Senior Securities, if we were to elect to treat such unfunded commitments, which were $85,075 as of December 31, 2022 as Senior Securities for purposes of Section 18 of the 1940 Act, our asset coverage per unit would be $1,934.

10,000,000
shares, par value $ 0.001

In connection with such offering, on October 30, 2020, February 17, 2022, and October 11, 2022, we filed Articles Supplementary with the SDAT, reclassifying and designating an additional
80,000,000
shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of
187,000
shares, par value $ 0.001

5.50 % Preferred Stock and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the “Preferred Stock Plan” or the “Preferred Stock DRIP”), pursuant to which holders of the
5.50 % Preferred Stock and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock will have dividends on their
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock at a price per share of $ 25.00 , if they elect. Each series of
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness .

82 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) At any time prior to the listing of the
5.50 % Preferred Stock and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the
5.50 % Preferred Stock and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the
5.50 % Preferred Stock and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock (the “Holder Optional Conversion”). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the
five
consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (such arithmetic average, the “ 5-day
VWAP”). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA2 Preferred Stock and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, “Settlement Amount” means (A) $ 25.00
per share (the “Stated Value”), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Holder Optional Conversion Fee for the respective Holder Conversion Deadline. For the Series M Preferred Stock, “Settlement Amount” means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any. “Series M Clawback”, if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the
five year
anniversary of the date on which a share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the
five year
anniversary of the date on which a share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange. Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the
five year
anniversary of the date on which a share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock has been issued, or, for listed shares of
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock,
five years
from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates, the “Redemption Eligibility Date”), such share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the “Issuer Optional Redemption”), at a redemption price of
100 % of the Stated Value of the shares of
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. Subject to certain limitations, each share of
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the “Issuer Optional Conversion”). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the
5-day
VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the
5-day
VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock, “IOC Settlement Amount” means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the
5-day
VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of
5.50 % Preferred Stock and
6.50 % Preferred Stock, the holder of such
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such
5.50 % Preferred Stock or
6.50 % Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion. On July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of
6,000,000
shares, or $ 150,000
in aggregate liquidation preference, of our
83 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) 5.35 % Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock” or “ 5.35 % Preferred Stock”), at a public offering price of $ 25.00
per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a
30-day
option to purchase up to an additional
900,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offer settled on July 19, 2021, and no additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued pursuant to the option. In connection with such offering, on July 15, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with SDAT, reclassifying and designating
6,900,000
shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
The Series A Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness .
See Note 8,
Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding
for further discussion on our senior securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, at any time after the close of business on July 19, 2026 (any such date, an “Optional Redemption Date”), at our sole option, we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or, from time to time, in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference of $ 25.00
per share, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. We may also redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or, from time to time, in part, including prior to the Optional Redemption Date, pro rata, based on liquidation preference, with all other series of our then outstanding preferred stock, in the event that our Board determines to redeem any series of our preferred stock, in whole or, from time to time, in part, because such redemption is deemed necessary by the Board to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act or for us to maintain RIC status. In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below), we may, at our option, exercise our special optional redemption right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within
120
days after the first date on which such Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred by paying the liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for such redemption. To the extent that we exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not be permitted to exercise the conversion right described below in respect of their shares called for redemption. Except to the extent that we have elected to exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right by providing notice of redemption prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of our shares of common stock per Series A Preferred Stock to be converted equal to the lesser of: • the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Record Date for a Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and • 6.03865 , subject to certain adjustments, subject, in each case, to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration upon conversion as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we have provided or provide a redemption notice with respect to some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of any Series A Preferred Stock that we have called for redemption will not be permitted to exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right in respect of any of their Series A Preferred Stock that have been called for redemption, and any Series A Preferred Stock subsequently called for redemption that have been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the applicable date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a redemption upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the following definitions are applicable: 84 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) “Change of Control Triggering Event” means the occurrence of any of the following: • the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Controlled Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than to any Permitted Holders); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, a pledge of assets pursuant to any of our secured debt instruments or the secured debt instruments of our Controlled Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be any such sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or disposition; or • the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than any Permitted Holders) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of any of the transactions referred to in the bullet points above will not be deemed a Change of Control Triggering Event if we or the acquiring or surviving consolidated entity has or continues to have a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or is otherwise listed or quoted on a national securities exchange. The “Change of Control Conversion Date” is the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be converted, which will be a business day selected by us that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. The “Common Stock Price” will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by the holders of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of our common stock or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by holders of our common stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of our common stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our common stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for our common stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event, if our common stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. “Controlled Subsidiary” means any of our subsidiaries, 50% or more of the outstanding equity interests of which are owned by us and our direct or indirect subsidiaries and of which we possess, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies, whether through the ownership of voting equity interests, by agreement or otherwise. “Excluded Transaction” means (i) any transaction that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of our Voting Stock; (ii) any changes resulting from a subdivision or combination or a change solely in par value; (iii) any transaction where the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (iv) any transaction if (A) we become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (B)(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) immediately following that transaction no “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company; or (v) any transaction primarily for the purpose of changing our jurisdiction of incorporation or form of organization. “Permitted Holders” means (i) us, (ii) one or more of our Controlled Subsidiaries and (iii) Prospect Capital Management or any affiliate of Prospect Capital Management that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction located in the United States of America and in the business of managing or advising clients. “Voting Stocks” as applied to stock of any person, means shares, interests, participations or other equivalents in the equity interest (however designated) in such person having ordinary voting power for the election of the directors (or the equivalent)
85 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) of such person, other than shares, interests, participations or other equivalents having such power only by reason of the occurrence of a contingency. Except as provided above in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. For so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, we will not exercise any option we have to convert any other series of our outstanding preferred stock to common stock, including the Issuer Optional Conversion, or any other security ranking junior to such preferred stock. As a result, and in accordance with ASC 480, we have presented our
5.50 % Preferred Stock,
6.50 % Preferred Stock, and Series A Preferred Stock within temporary equity on our
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we issued

Common Stock Our common stockholders’ equity accounts as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares previously repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our common stock dividend reinvestment plan in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies and in connection with our
5.50 % and
6.50 % Preferred Stock Holder Optional Conversion and Optional Redemptions Following Death of a Holder. When our common stock is issued, the related offering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us.
On August 24, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “Repurchase Program”) under which we may repurchase up to $ 100,000
of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share. Prior to any repurchase, we are required to notify stockholders of our intention to purchase our common stock.
We did
not
repurchase any shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Repurchase Program is $ 65,860 . Excluding common stock dividend reinvestments and shares issued in connection with the
5.50 % and
6.50 % Preferred Stock Holder Optional Conversion and Optional Redemption Upon Death of Holder, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we did
not
issue any shares of our common stock.
89 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) On February 9, 2016, we amended our common stock dividend reinvestment plan that provided for reinvestment of our dividends or distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash, to add the ability of stockholders to purchase additional common shares by making optional cash investments. Under the revised dividend reinvestment and direct common stock repurchase plan, stockholders may elect to purchase additional common shares through our transfer agent in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
On April 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved further amendments to our common stock dividend reinvestment plan, effective May 21, 2020, that principally provide for the number of newly-issued shares of our common stock to be credited to a stockholder’s account shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such common stockholder by
95 % of the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date fixed by the Board of Directors for such distribution (which shall be the last business day before the payment date). On June 10, 2022, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed
25 % of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale). During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we distributed approximately $ 142,742
and $ 140,283 , respectively, to our common stockholders.
The following table summarizes our distributions to common stockholders declared and payable for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Amount Per Share Amount Distributed (in thousands) 5/7/2021 7/28/2021 8/19/2021 $ 0.06   $ 23,325   5/7/2021 8/27/2021 9/23/2021 0.06   23,348   8/24/2021 9/28/2021 10/21/2021 0.06   23,370   8/24/2021 10/27/2021 11/18/2021 0.06   23,392   11/5/2021 11/26/2021 12/23/2021 0.06   23,413   11/5/2021 12/29/2021 1/20/2022 0.06   23,435   Total declared and payable for the six months ended December 31, 2021 $ 140,283   5/6/2022 7/27/2022 8/18/2022 $ 0.06   $ 23,635   5/6/2022 8/29/2022 9/21/2022 0.06   23,670   8/23/2022 9/28/2022 10/20/2022 0.06   23,767   8/23/2022 10/27/2022 11/17/2022 0.06   23,857   11/8/2022 11/28/2022 12/20/2022 0.06   23,888   11/8/2022 12/28/2022 1/19/2023 0.06   23,925   Total declared and payable for the six months ended December 31, 2022 $ 142,742   Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. As such, the table above includes distributions with record dates during six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. It does not include distributions previously declared to common stockholders of record on any future dates, as those amounts are not yet determinable. The following dividends were previously declared and will be recorded and payable subsequent to December 31, 2022: • $ 0.06

4,459,506
and
2,148,594
shares of our common stock, respectively, in connection with the common stock dividend reinvestment plan. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Prospect officers and directors purchased

Other Income Other income consists of structuring fees, amendment fees, overriding royalty interests, revenue receipts related to net profit interests, deal deposits, administrative agent fees, and other miscellaneous and sundry cash receipts.
The following table shows income from such sources during the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Structuring and amendment fees (refer to Note 3) $ 5,103   $ 16,853   $ 9,730   $ 28,814   Royalty and net revenue interests 14,609   10,487   35,287   20,294   Administrative agent fees 111   159   261   327   Total other income $ 19,823   $ 27,499   $ 45,278   $ 49,435   Note 11.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets per Common Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, less preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding using the if-converted method for the
5.50 % Preferred Stock, for the
6.50 % Preferred Stock (Refer to Note 9) and, beginning on July 1, 2022, for the 2025 Notes (Refer to Note 5).
Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on July 1, 2022, for the purpose of calculating diluted net increase in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company utilized the if-converted method, which assumes full share settlement for the aggregate value of the 2025 Notes,
the
5.50 % Preferred Stock, and the
6.50 % Preferred Stock. Under the allowed modified retrospective method, diluted net increase in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders per share for prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of ASU 2020-06. Diluted earnings per share excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, conversion of our convertible instruments has an anti-dilutive effect and therefore, conversion is not assumed. The following information sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share during the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:   For the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations - basic $ 55,623   $ 246,411   $ ( 49,576 ) $ 456,135   Adjustment for dividends on Convertible Preferred Stock 11,720   7,202   —   9,609   Adjustment for interest on Convertible Notes 2,166   —   —   —   Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations - diluted $ 69,509   $ 253,613   $ ( 49,576 ) $ 465,744   Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 397,685,022 389,991,324 396,011,231 389,438,733 Assumed conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock 132,389,021 27,961,023 — 23,401,402 Assumed conversion of Convertible Notes 17,294,357 — — — Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding - diluted 547,368,400 417,952,347 396,011,231 412,840,135 Earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 0.14   $ 0.63   $ ( 0.13 ) $ 1.17   Earnings (loss) per share - diluted

Income Taxes While our fiscal year end for financial reporting purposes is June 30 of each year, our tax year end is August 31 of each year. The information presented in this footnote is based on our tax year end for each period presented, unless otherwise specified.
For income tax purposes, dividends paid and distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of dividends paid to common stockholders during the tax years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows:   Tax Year Ended August 31,   2022 2021 2020 Ordinary income $ 230,758   $ 251,171   $ 169,041   Capital gain 50,945   —   —   Return of capital —   25,784   96,720   Total common dividends paid to stockholders $ 281,703   (1) $ 276,955   $ 265,761   (1) Final determination of tax character will not be final until we file our return for the tax year ended August 31, 2022. The Company began issuing shares of Preferred Stock and declaring dividends on shares Preferred Stock outstanding during the tax year ended August 31, 2021. The tax character of dividends paid to preferred stockholders during the tax years ended August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021 were as follows:   Tax Year Ended August 31, 2022 Tax Year Ended August 31, 2021 Ordinary income $ 23,778   $ 2,391   Capital gain 5,249   —   Return of capital —   —   Total preferred dividends paid to stockholders $ 29,027   (2) $ 2,391   (2) Final determination of tax character will not be final until we file our return for the tax year ended August 31, 2022. As of August 25, 2021 when our prior Form 10-K was filed for the year ended June 30, 2021, we estimated our distributions for the fiscal year then ended to be $ 265,593
of distributions of ordinary income and $ 12,263
of our distributions to be return of capital. Subsequent to our filing date, we obtained more information from our underlying investments as to the character of the distributions for the tax year ended August 31, 2021, which resulted in changes to distributions previously disclosed in our Form 10-K filing. As a result of the change, our total distributable loss on our
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
for the year ended June 30, 2021 changed from $ 232,659
to $ 210,570 , with $ 22,089
being reclassified to distributions from capital. The remaining reclassification of tax distributions classified as return of capital for the tax year ended August 31, 2021 have been adjusted in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This adjustment resulted in an increase to distributable earnings of $ 3,695
for the three months ended September 30, 2021 . We generate certain types of income that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to non-U.S. stockholders. Under IRC Section 871(k), a RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. stockholders with proper documentation. For the 2022 calendar year,
59.23 % of our taxable ordinary dividends as of December 31, 2022 qualified as interest related dividends which are exempt from U.S. withholding tax applicable to non-U.S. stockholders. This percentage is based on the best estimates available at the time of this filing. The final percentage will be determined with the filing of Form 1099-DIV. We generate income that may be beneficial to shareholders that face interest expense limitations. Under IRC Section 163(j), a RIC is permitted to designate distributions attributable to net business interest income as section 163(j) interest dividends. For the 2022 calendar year
88.32 % of our taxable ordinary dividends as of December 31, 2022 qualified as section 163(j) interest dividends. This percentage is based on the best estimates available at the time of this filing. The final percentage will be determined with the filing of Form 1099-DIV. We generate dividend income that may be beneficial to certain U.S. corporate shareholders. Under IRC Sections 243 and 854, a RIC is permitted to designate ordinary dividends as eligible for the 50% dividends received deduction. For the 2022 calendar year
3.97 % of our taxable ordinary dividends as of December 31, 2022 qualified for the deduction under sections 243 and 854.
92 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) This percentage is based on the best estimates available at the time of this filing. The final percentage will be determined with the filing of Form 1099-DIV. For the tax year ending August 31, 2022, the tax character of dividends paid to stockholders through August 31, 2022 is expected to be ordinary income and capital gains however due to the difference between our fiscal and tax year ends, the final determination of the tax character of dividends between ordinary income and capital gains will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ending August 31, 2022. Taxable income generally differs from net increase in net assets resulting from operations for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized gains or losses, as unrealized gains or losses are generally not included in taxable income until they are realized.
The following reconciles the net increase in net assets resulting from operations to taxable income for the tax years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:   Tax Year Ended August 31,   2022 2021 2020 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations $ 735,343   $ 428,106   $ ( 78,949 ) Net realized (gains) losses on investments 22,375   16,173   10,139   Net unrealized (gains) losses on investments ( 405,414 ) ( 143,654 ) 328,997   Other temporary book-to-tax differences ( 43,709 ) ( 47,330 ) ( 91,368 ) Permanent differences 30   ( 20 ) 57   Taxable income before deductions for distributions $ 308,625   (3) $ 253,275   $ 168,876   (3)
Final determination of permanent differences will not be final until we file our return for the tax year ended August 31, 2022.
Capital losses in excess of capital gains earned in a tax year may generally be carried forward and used to offset capital gains, subject to certain limitations. As of August 31, 2022, we had
no
capital loss carryforwards available for use in later tax years. While our ability to utilize losses in the future depends upon a variety of factors that cannot be known in advance, some of the Company’s capital loss carryforwards may become permanently unavailable due to limitations by the Code. For the tax year ended August 31, 2022, we had $ 54,089
of undistributed ordinary income in excess of cumulative distributions and
no
capital gain in excess of cumulative distributions. As of December 31, 2022, the cost basis of investments for tax purposes was $ 7,817,675
resulting in an estimated net unrealized loss of $ 47,339 . As of December 31, 2022, the gross unrealized gains and losses were $ 1,414,383
and $ 1,461,722 , respectively. As of June 30, 2022, the cost basis of investments for tax purposes was $ 7,214,493
resulting in an estimated net unrealized gain of $ 388,017 . As of June 30, 2022, the gross unrealized gains and losses were $ 1,506,944
and $ 1,118,927 , respectively. Due to the difference between our fiscal year end and tax year end, the cost basis of our investments for tax purposes as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was calculated based on the book cost of investments as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, with cumulative book-to-tax adjustments for investments through August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In general, we may make certain adjustments to the classification of net assets as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences, which may include merger-related items, differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, and nondeductible federal excise taxes, among other items. During the tax year ended August 31, 2022, we increased overdistributed net investment income by $ 30
and decreased capital in excess of par value by $ 30 . During the tax year ended August 31, 2021, we decreased overdistributed net investment income by $ 20
and increased capital in excess of par value by $ 20 . Due to the difference between our fiscal and tax year end, the reclassifications for the taxable year ended August 31, 2022, once finalized, will be recorded in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 and the reclassifications for the taxable year ended August 31, 2021 were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. 93 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13.
Related Party Agreements and Transactions Investment Advisory Agreement We have entered into an investment advisory and management agreement with the Investment Adviser (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser: (i) determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes, (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies), and (iii) closes and monitors investments we make.
The Investment Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. For providing these services the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of
2.00 % on our total assets. For services currently rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. The total gross base management fee incurred to the favor of the Investment Adviser was $ 38,882
and $ 33,843
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The total gross base management fee incurred to the favor of the Investment Advisor was $ 77,196
and $ 66,046
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The incentive fee has
two
parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees and other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement described below, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate” of
1.75 % per quarter ( 7.00 % annualized).
The net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the gross assets used to calculate the
2.00 % base management fee. We pay the Investment Adviser an income incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
• No incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate;
• 100.00 % of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than
125.00 % of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter ( 8.75 % annualized assuming a
7.00 % annualized hurdle rate); and
• 20.00 % of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds
125.00 % of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter ( 8.75 % annualized assuming a
7.00 % annualized hurdle rate).
These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter.
94 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) The second part of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals
20.00 % of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Investment Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an “investment” is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to
20.00 % of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception.
The total income incentive fee incurred was $ 22,505
and $ 19,589
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fees incurred for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $ 44,131
and $ 39,329 , respectively.
No
capital gains incentive fee was incurred during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Administration Agreement We have also entered into an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration, among other things, provides (or arranges for the provision of) administrative services and facilities for us. For providing these services, we reimburse Prospect Administration for our allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff, including the internal legal staff. Under this agreement, Prospect Administration furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Prospect Administration also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Prospect Administration assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, Prospect Administration also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance (see
Managerial Assistance
section below). The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. Prospect Administration is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser.
The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Prospect Administration and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Prospect Administration’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. Our payments to Prospect Administration are reviewed quarterly by our Board of Directors.
The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $ 3,618
and $ 2,239
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $ 6,717
and $ 6,765
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of $ 766
and
4,315
directly from our portfolio companies, and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal services during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, we were given a credit in the amount
95 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) of $ 1,212
for legal expenses incurred on behalf of our portfolio companies that were remitted to Prospect Administration during the six months ended December 31, 2022. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration’s charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount. Managerial Assistance As a BDC, we are obligated under the 1940 Act to make available to certain of our portfolio companies significant managerial assistance. “Making available significant managerial assistance” refers to any arrangement whereby we provide significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We are also deemed to be providing managerial assistance to all portfolio companies that we control, either by ourselves or in conjunction with others. The nature and extent of significant managerial assistance provided by us to controlled and non-controlled portfolio companies will vary according to the particular needs of each portfolio company. Examples of such activities include (i) advice on recruiting, hiring, management and termination of employees, officers and directors, succession planning and other human resource matters; (ii) advice on capital raising, capital budgeting, and capital expenditures; (iii) advice on advertising, marketing, and sales; (iv) advice on fulfillment, operations, and execution; (v) advice on managing relationships with unions and other personnel organizations, financing sources, vendors, customers, lessors, lessees, lawyers, accountants, regulators and other important counterparties; (vi) evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities, plant expansions and closings, and market expansions; (vii) participating in audit committee, nominating committee, board and management meetings; (viii) consulting with and advising board members and officers of portfolio companies (on overall strategy and other matters); and (ix) providing other organizational, operational, managerial and financial guidance. Prospect Administration, when performing a managerial assistance agreement executed with each portfolio company to which we provide managerial assistance, arranges for the provision of such managerial assistance on our behalf. When doing so, Prospect Administration utilizes personnel of our Investment Adviser. We, on behalf of Prospect Administration, invoice portfolio companies receiving and paying for managerial assistance, and we remit to Prospect Administration its cost of providing such services, including the charges deemed appropriate by our Investment Adviser for providing such managerial assistance. No income is recognized by Prospect. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we received payments of $ 2,932
and $ 1,835 , respectively, from our portfolio companies for managerial assistance and subsequently remitted these amounts to Prospect Administration.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we received payments of $ 4,692
and $ 3,670 , respectively, from our portfolio companies for managerial assistance and subsequently remitted these amounts to Prospect Administration. Co-Investments On January 13, 2020, (amended on August 2, 2022), we received an exemptive order from the SEC (the “Order”), which superseded a prior co-investment exemptive order granted on February 10, 2014, that gave us the ability to negotiate terms other than price and quantity of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by the Investment Adviser or certain affiliates, including Priority Income Fund, Inc. and Prospect Floating Rate and Alternative Income Fund, Inc. (f/k/a Prospect Sustainable Income Fund, Inc.), where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions included therein.  Under the terms of the relief permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. In certain situations where a co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, the personnel of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, when relying on the Order, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which one or more funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates has previously invested. 96 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(Continued) (in thousands, except share and per share data) We reimburse CLO investment valuation services fees initially incurred by Priority Income Fund, Inc. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized expenses that were reimbursed for valuation services of $ 24
and $ 30 , respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized expenses that were reimbursed for valuation services of $ 45
and $ 61 , respectively. Conversely, Priority Income Fund, Inc. and Prospect Floating Rate and Alternative Income Fund, Inc. (f/k/a Prospect Sustainable Income Fund, Inc.) reimburse us for software fees, expenses which were initially incurred by Prospect.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.) The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere herein. Overview The terms “Prospect”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” mean Prospect Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.
Prospect is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). We were organized on April 13, 2004, and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004.
On May 15, 2007, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Capital Funding LLC (“PCF”), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Our wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Small Business Lending, LLC (“PSBL”) was formed on January 27, 2014, and purchased small business whole loans from online small business loan originators, including On Deck Capital, Inc. (“OnDeck”). On September 30, 2014, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Prospect Yield Corporation, LLC (“PYC”) and effective October 23, 2014, PYC holds a portion of our collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes (“SSNs”). Each of these subsidiaries have been consolidated since operations commenced.
We consolidate certain of our wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us in order to facilitate our investment strategy. The following companies are included in our consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as the “Consolidated Holding Companies”: CP Holdings of Delaware LLC (“CP Holdings”); Credit Central Holdings of Delaware, LLC (“Credit Central Delaware”); Energy Solutions Holdings Inc.; First Tower Holdings of Delaware LLC (“First Tower Delaware”); MITY Holdings of Delaware Inc. (“MITY Delaware”); Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC; NMMB Holdings, Inc. (“NMMB Holdings”); NPH Property Holdings, LLC (“NPH”); Prospect Opportunity Holdings I, Inc. (“POHI”); SB Forging Company, Inc. (“SB Forging”); STI Holding, Inc.; UTP Holdings Group Inc. (“UTP Holdings”); Valley Electric Holdings I, Inc. (“Valley Holdings I”); and Valley Electric Holdings II, Inc. (“Valley Holdings II”). We are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. (“Prospect Capital Management” or the “Investment Adviser”). Prospect Administration LLC (“Prospect Administration”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated secured debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro-forma cash flows.
We currently have four primary strategies that guide our origination of investment opportunities: (1) lending to companies, including companies controlled by private equity sponsors and not controlled by private equity sponsors, and including both directly-originated loans and syndicated loans, (2) lending to companies and purchasing controlling equity positions in such companies, including both operating companies and financial services companies, (3) purchasing controlling equity positions and lending to real estate companies, and (4) investing in structured credit. We may also invest in other strategies and opportunities from time to time that we view as attractive. We continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific top-down allocation to any single origination strategy. 112 Lending to Companies - We make directly-originated, agented loans to companies, including companies which are controlled by private equity sponsors and companies that are not controlled by private equity sponsors (such as companies that are controlled by the management team, the founder, a family or public shareholders). This debt can take the form of first lien, second lien, unitranche or unsecured loans. These loans typically have equity subordinate to our loan position. We may also purchase selected equity co-investments in such companies. In addition to directly-originated, agented loans, we also invest in senior and secured loans syndicated loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a club or syndicate of buyers, both in the primary and secondary markets. These investments are often purchased with a long term, buy-and-hold outlook, and we often look to provide significant input to the transaction by providing anchoring orders. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 40%-60% of our portfolio.
Lending to Companies and Purchasing Controlling Equity Positions in Such Companies - This strategy involves purchasing senior and secured yield-producing debt and controlling equity positions in operating companies across various industries. We believe this strategy provides enhanced certainty of closure to sellers and the opportunity for management to continue on in their current roles. These investments are often structured in tax-efficient partnerships, enhancing returns. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 15%-25% of our portfolio.
Purchasing Controlling Equity Positions and Lending to Real Estate Companies - We purchase debt and controlling equity positions in tax-efficient real estate investment trusts (“REIT” or “REITs”). The real estate investments of National Property REIT Corp. (“NPRC”) are in various classes of developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields, including multi-family properties, and student housing. NPRC seeks to identify properties that have historically significant occupancy rates and recurring cash flow generation. NPRC generally co-invests with established and experienced property management teams that manage such properties after acquisition. Additionally, NPRC makes investments in rated secured structured notes (primarily debt of structured credit). NPRC also purchases loans originated by certain consumer loan facilitators. It purchases each loan in its entirety (i.e., a “whole loan”). The borrowers are consumers, and the loans are typically serviced by the facilitators of the loans. Historically, this overall investment strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our business. Investing in Structured Credit - We make investments in structured credit, often taking a significant position in subordinated structured notes (equity) and rated secured structured notes (debt). The underlying portfolio of each structured credit investment is diversified across approximately 100 to 200 broadly syndicated loans and does not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. The structured credit portfolios in which we invest are managed by established collateral management teams with many years of experience in the industry. Historically, this overall strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our portfolio.
We invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in structured credit are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of structured credit which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our structured credit investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B.
We hold many of our control investments in a two-tier structure consisting of a holding company and one or more related operating companies for tax purposes. These holding companies serve various business purposes including concentration of management teams, optimization of third-party borrowing costs, improvement of supplier, customer, and insurance terms, and enhancement of co-investments by the management teams. In these cases, our investment, which is generally equity in the holding company, the holding company’s equity investment in the operating company and any debt from us directly to the operating company structure represents our total exposure for the investment. As of December 31, 2022, as shown in our
Consolidated Schedule of Investments , the cost basis and fair value of our investments in controlled companies was $2,821,034 and $3,457,698, respectively. This structure gives rise to several of the risks described in our public documents and highlighted elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We consolidate all wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us for the purpose of holding our controlled investments in operating companies. There is no significant effect of consolidating these holding companies as they hold minimal assets other than their investments in the controlled operating companies. Investment company accounting prohibits the consolidation of any operating companies. 113 Second Quarter Highlights Investment Transactions We seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we acquired $228,220 of new investments, completed follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $45,520, funded $7,409 of revolver advances, and recorded PIK interest of $26,832, resulting in gross investment originations of $307,981. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we received full repayments totaling $20,874, received $6,805 in sales, received $73 of revolver paydowns, and received $48,980 in partial prepayments, scheduled principal amortization payments, and return of capital distributions, resulting in net repayments of $76,732. Debt Issuances and Redemptions
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $1,851 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes® at par in accordance with the Survivor’s Option, as defined in the InterNotes® Offering prospectus. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes® in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $46.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we issued $2,852 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes® with a weighted average stated interest rate of 5.53%, to extend our borrowing base. The newly issued notes mature between October 15, 2025 and December 15, 2032 and generated net proceeds of $2,820.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we increased total commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility by $67,500 to $1,701,500 in the aggregate. On October 17, 2022, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the $283,872 then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at a price of 98.50%, plus accrued and unpaid interest (“2023 Notes October Tender Offer”). On October 26, 2022, $1,508 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes were validly tendered and accepted. On November 14, 2022, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the $282,364 then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at a price of 98.75%, plus accrued and unpaid interest (“2023 Notes November Tender Offer”). On November 23, 2022, $249 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes were validly tendered and accepted. The 2023 Notes October and November Tender Offers resulted in our recognizing a loss of $5.
Equity Issuances On October 20, 2022, November 17, 2022, and December 20, 2022, we issued 1,395,583, 440,526, and 468,439 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
72,711 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock, 2,813 shares of our Series A3 Preferred Stock, 34,085 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock, and 600 shares of our Series M3 Preferred Stock were converted to 368,877 shares of our common stock, in connection with Holder Optional Conversions and Optional Redemptions Following Death of a Holder. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we issued 453,539 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $10,205, 10,187,160 shares of our Series A3 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $229,211, 105,204 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $2,551, and 1,157,619 shares of our Series M3 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $28,072, each excluding offering costs and preferred stock dividend reinvestment. In connection with our Preferred Stock Dividend Reinvestment Plan, we issued additional Series A1 Preferred Stock and Series M1 Preferred Stock of 2,742, 4,059, and 4,599 shares throughout October, November and December 2022. Investment Holdings
At December 31, 2022, we have $7,770,336, or 195.9%, of our net assets applicable to common shares invested in 130 long-term portfolio investments and CLOs.
Our annualized current yield was 12.9% and 11.1% as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, across all performing interest bearing investments, excluding equity investments and non-accrual loans. Our annualized current yield was 10.3% and 8.7% as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, across all investments. In many of our portfolio companies we hold equity positions, ranging from minority interests to majority stakes, which we expect over time to contribute
114 to our investment returns. Some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns, preferred distributions, flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns, as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity, in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections. We are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, “Control Investments” are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses a beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, “Affiliate Investments” are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. “Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments” are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. As of December 31, 2022, we own controlling interests in the following portfolio companies: CP Energy Services Inc. (“CP Energy”); Credit Central Loan Company, LLC (“Credit Central”); Echelon Transportation, LLC (“Echelon”); First Tower Finance Company LLC (“First Tower Finance”); Freedom Marine Solutions, LLC (“Freedom Marine”); InterDent, Inc. (“InterDent”); Kickapoo Ranch Pet Resort (“Kickapoo”); MITY, Inc. (“MITY”); NPRC; Nationwide Loan Company LLC (“Nationwide”); NMMB, Inc. (“NMMB”); Pacific World Corporation (“Pacific World”); R-V Industries, Inc. (“R-V”); Universal Turbine Parts, LLC (“UTP”); USES Corp. (“United States Environmental Services” or “USES”); and Valley Electric Company, Inc. (“Valley Electric”). In June 2019, CP Energy purchased a controlling interest of the common equity of Spartan Energy Holdings, Inc. (“Spartan Holdings”), which owns 100% of Spartan Energy Services, LLC (“Spartan”), a portfolio company of Prospect with $27,347 in senior secured term loans (the “Spartan Term Loan A”) due to us as of December 31, 2022. As a result of CP Energy’s purchase, and given Prospect’s controlling interest in CP Energy, we report our investments in Spartan as control investment. Spartan remains the direct borrower and guarantor to Prospect for the Spartan Term Loan A. As of December 31, 2022, we also own affiliated interests in Nixon, Inc.

117 Portfolio Investment Activity Our origination efforts are focused primarily on secured lending to non-control investments to reduce the risk in the portfolio by investing primarily in first lien loans and second lien loans, though we also continue to close select equity investments. For information regarding investment activity for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented below:   Six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Investments in portfolio companies Investments in new portfolio companies $ 338,473  $ 810,424  Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies

During the six months ended December 31, 2021, approximately $30,506 of PIK interest capitalized was accrued as interest income and the remaining $4,206 was included due to the timing of interest payment dates and resulting capitalization occurring during the prior year.     (3) Includes partial prepayments of principal, scheduled amortization payments and refinancings, if any. (4) Weighted average interest rates for new investments by portfolio composition is calculated with the current rate at the end of the period. In addition, Revolving Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loans are excluded from the calculation. 118 Investment Valuation Investments for which market quotations are readily available must be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. These investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of debt investments specifically classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy are generally valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We generally value over-the-counter securities by using the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers during the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not readily available, and are therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used. In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulations used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model.
With respect to our online consumer and SME lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms.  We do not conduct loan origination activities ourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase consumer and SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of consumer and SME loans, are directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase consumer and SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of consumer and SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms’ ability to effectively evaluate a borrower’s credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers’ credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.
The Board of Directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to valu e the asset including: recent operating and financial trends for the asset, independent ratings obtained from third parties, comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for ou r investments in CLOs. The composite of all these various valuation techniques, applied to each investment, was a total valuatio n of $7,770,336. Our portfolio companies are generally lower middle-market companies, outside of the financial sector, with less than $100,000 of annual EBITDA. We believe our investment portfolio has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments. 119 Control Company Investments Control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments. Operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter. Significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment. Equity positions in our portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value, both increases as well as decreases, due to changes in operating results and market multiples. Our controlled companies discussed below experienced such changes and we recorded corresponding fluctuati ons in valuations during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Credit Central Loan Company, LLC Prospect owns 100% of the equity of Credit Central Delaware, a consolidated holding company. Credit Central Delaware owns 99.81% of Credit Central, with entities owned by Credit Central management owning the remaining 0.19% of the equity. Credit Central is a branch-based provider of installment loans. The fair value of our investment in Credit Central decreased to $72,486 as of December 31, 2022, which represents a discount of $27,097 from its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of $76,935 as of June 30, 2022, representing a discount of $16,298 to its amortized cost basis. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from a decline in financial performance. Echelon Transportation, LLC
Prospect owns 100% of the equity of Echelon, a consolidated holding company. Echelon owns 60.7% of the equity of AerLift. Echelon is an aircraft leasing company. The fair value of our investment in Echelon decreased to $55,564 as of December 31, 2022, representing a discount of $54,814 to its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $65,766 as of June 30, 2022, representing a discount of $43,024 to its amortized cost basis. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from lower aircraft residual values and a transfer of assets that occurred after the valuation date, but for which conditions existed as of the valuation date. National Property REIT Corp. NPRC is a Maryland corporation and a qualified REIT for federal income tax purposes. NPRC is held for purposes of investing, operating, financing, leasing, managing and selling a portfolio of real estate assets and engages in any and all other activities that may be necessary, incidental, or convenient to perform the foregoing.

The decrease in premium is primarily driven by a decrease in like-for-like property values due to a rise in discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, partially offset by an increase in market interest rates and growth in net operating income in our real estate portfolio. Our controlled investments, including those discussed above, are valued at
$636,664
above their amortized cost as of December 31, 2022. Affiliate and Non-Control Company Investments We hold two affiliate investments at
December 31, 2022
(Nixon, Inc. and RGIS Services, LLC, (“RGIS”)) with a total fair value of $7,944, a discount of $1,052 from their combined amortized cost. We held four affiliate investments at June 30, 2022 (Nixon, Inc., RGIS, Targus Cayman HoldCo Limited (“Targus”), and PGX Holdings, Inc. (“PGX”)) with a total fair value of $393,264, representing a $151,163 premium to its amortized cost. The decrease in premium is primarily driven by our equity sale of Targus and the restructuring of PGX, which drove a transfer of PGX’s investment classification from affiliate to non-control/non-affiliate as of December 31, 2022. With the non-control/non-affiliate investments, generally, there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control/affiliate investments, and debt investments are generally not as
122 susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments. For debt investments, the fair value is generally limited on the high side to each loan’s par value, plus any prepayment premium that could be imposed. However, as of December 31, 2022, four of our non-control/ non-affiliate investments, United Sporting Companies, Inc. (“USC”), Engine Group, Inc. (“Engine”), Curo Group Holdings Corp. (“Curo”), and K&N (“K&N Parent, Inc.) are valued at discounts to amortized cost of $81,169, $29,727, $25,003, and $24,377, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our CLO investment portfolio is valued at a $297,555 discount to amortized cost. Excluding USC, Engine, Curo, K&N, and the CLO investment portfolio, the fair value of our non-control/non-affiliate investments at December 31, 2022 are valued at $8,725 above their amortized cost and did not experience significant changes in operating performance or value. Our largest non-control/non-affiliate investment is PGX, which is valued at $58,246 above its amortized cost and represents approximately 7.7% of our Net Asset Value as of December 31, 2022. PGX is a credit repair solutions company. Capitalization Our investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business. We capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity. Our debt as of December 31, 2022 consists of: a Revolving Credit Facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations; Convertible Notes which we issued in March 2019; Public Notes which we issued in March 2013, October 2018, January 2021, May 2021 and September 2021; and Prospect Capital InterNotes® which we issue from time to time. As of December 31, 2022, our equity capital is comprised of common and preferred equity.

The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of outstanding debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.
Historically, we have funded a portion of our cash needs through borrowings from banks, issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common equity. For flexibility, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, and warrants and units to purchase such securities up to an indeterminate amount. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. Each of our Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes® (collectively, our “Unsecured Notes”) are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any of our subordinated indebtedness that may be issued in the future. The Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing secured indebtedness, such as our credit facility, and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries. 124 Revolving Credit Facility On May 15, 2007, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, Prospect Capital Funding LLC (“PCF”), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Since origination of the revolving credit facility, we have renegotiated the terms and extended the commitments of the revolving credit facility several times. Most recently, effective September 15, 2022, we completed an extension and upsizing of the revolving credit facility (the “2022 Facility” or the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The lenders have extended commitments of $1,701,500 as of December 31, 2022.
The 2022 Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate. The extension and upsizing of the Revolving Credit Facility extends the maturity date to September 15, 2027 and the revolving period through September 15, 2026, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had $805,571 and $660,536, respectively, available to us for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $754,305 and $839,464 outstanding borrowings as of the respective balance sheet dates. Refer to Note 4.

Prospect Capital InterNotes ® On February 13, 2020, we entered into a new selling agent agreement with InspereX LLC (formerly known as “Incapital LLC”)(the “Selling Agent Agreement”), authorizing the issuance and sale from time to time of up to $1,000,000 of Prospect Capital InterNotes® (collectively with previously authorized selling agent agreements, the “ InterNotes® Offerings ”). Additional agents may be appointed by us from time to time in connection with the InterNotes® Offering and become parties to the Selling Agent Agreement.
We have, from time to time, repurchased certain notes issued through the InterNotes® Offerings and, therefore, as of

within our consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net Asset Value Applicable to Common Stockholders During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net asset value applicable to common shares decreased by $152,732 or $0.54 per common share. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net realized and net change in unrealized losses of $226,132, or $0.57 per basic weighted average common share. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net investment income of $205,970, or $0.52 per basic weighted average common share, also exceeded distributions to common and preferred stockholders of $172,156 (including distributions classified as return of capital distributions to common
126 stockholders), or $0.43 per basic weighted average common share, resulting in a net increase of $0.09 per basic weighted average common share. The increase was partially offset by $0.06 of dilution per common share related to common stock issuances through our dividend reinvestment program for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The following table shows the calculation of net asset value per common share as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Net assets available to common stockholders $ 3,966,391  $ 4,119,123  Shares of common stock issued and outstanding 398,852,478  393,164,437  Net asset value per common share $ 9.94  $ 10.48  Results of Operations Operating results for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Investment income $ 212,916  $ 175,376  $ 415,590  $ 344,850  Operating expenses 106,212  89,819  209,620  177,924  Net investment income 106,704  85,557  205,970  166,926  Net realized gains (losses) from investments 16,298  (9,227) (6,879) (9,828) Net change in unrealized (losses) gains from investments (50,673) 181,134  (219,173) 317,854  Net realized (losses) on extinguishment of debt (52) (3,851) (80) (9,208) Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 72,277  253,613  (20,162) 465,744  Preferred stock dividend 16,654  7,202  29,414  9,609  Net Increase (Decrease)
in Net Assets Resulting from Operations applicable to Common Stockholders $ 55,623  $ 246,411  $ (49,576) $ 456,135           While we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses, our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate. These companies typically do not issue securities rated investment grade, and have limited resources, limited operating history, and concentrated product lines or customers. These are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents. Changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company. These changes, along with those discussed in
Investment Valuation
above, can cause significant fluctuations in our net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments, and therefore our net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders, quarter over quarter.
Investment Income We generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments, if in the form of debt securities, will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. To the extent achievable, we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies’ assets. We also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies, which may pay cash or in-kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis. In addition, we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned. Investment income consists of interest income, including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees, dividend income and other income, including settlement of net profits interests, overriding royalty interests and structuring fees.
127 The following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments:   Three Months Ended December 31,

Excludes equity investments. The average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets increased from 9.25% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 10.43% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets increased from 8.83% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 9.97% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate earned on our portfolio increased by 1.18% due to a increase in the weighted average interest rate earned on our portfolio primarily due to LIBOR/SOFR rates rising above our floors amongst our interest-bearing investments, for which interest income increased from $117,709 to $163,418, for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. This was partially offset by a decline in early repayments, which caused an increase in accelerated income and prepayment premium income in the prior year, resulting in a decline in interest income from $6,208 to $1,410, for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average interest rate also increased by 0.23% for our structured credit investments which was due to an increase in income from $18,256 to $26,047, for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively which was caused by a decrease in the reinvestment price.
The average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets increased from 9.57% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 10.11% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets increased from 9.14% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 9.67% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate earned on our portfolio increased by 0.54% due to a increase in the weighted average interest rate earned on our portfolio primarily due to LIBOR/SOFR rates rising above our floors amongst our interest-bearing investments, for which interest income increased from $231,102 to $312,804, for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. This was partially offset by a decline in early repayments, which caused an increase in accelerated income and prepayment premium income in the prior year, resulting in a decline in interest income from $16,253 to $3,447, for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Investment income is also generated from dividends and other income which is less predictable than interest income. The following table describes dividend income earned for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Dividend income NMMB, Inc. $ 617  $ 3,046  $ 1,710  $ 3,046  Valley Electric Company, Inc. 503  1,700  547  1,700  RGIS Services, LLC —  —  1,374  —  Nationwide Loan Company LLC —  500  —  1,750  R-V Industries, Inc. —  441  —  441  Other, net 1,097  17  1,487  34  Total dividend income $ 2,217  $ 5,704  $ 5,118  $ 6,971  128 Other income is comprised of structuring fees, amendment fees, royalty interests, settlement of net profits interests, settlement of residual profits interests, administrative agent fees and other miscellaneous and sundry cash receipts.

Other income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $4,157 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a $19,084 decrease in structuring fees offset by an increase of $14,994 in net revenue interests from NPRC as a result of real estate asset sales.
Income recognized from dividend income, prepayment premium from early repayments, structuring fees and amendment fees related to specific loan positions is considered to be non-recurring income. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized $7,419 and $24,992 of non-recurring income, respectively. The $17,573 decrease in non-recurring income during three months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the $11,750 decrease in structuring and amendment fees discussed above. In addition to a decrease of $3,487 in dividend income and a decrease of $2,336 in prepayment premium income. Income recognized from dividend income, prepayment premium from early repayments, structuring fees and amendment fees related to specific loan positions is considered to be non-recurring income. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized $15,418 and $41,299 of non-recurring income, respectively. The $25,881 decrease in non-recurring income during six months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the $19,084 decrease in structuring and amendment fees discussed above. In addition to a decrease of $4,944 in prepayment premium income and a decrease of $1,853 in dividend income 129 Operating Expenses Our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees (base management and income incentive fees), borrowing costs, legal and professional fees, overhead-related expenses and other operating expenses. These expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration provides administrative services and facilities for us. Our investment advisory fees compensate the Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.
The following table describes the various components of our operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Base management fee $ 38,882  $ 33,843  $ 77,196  $ 66,046  Income incentive fee 22,505  19,589  44,131  39,329  Interest and credit facility expenses 37,783  29,679  71,653  57,717  Allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration 3,618  2,239  6,717  6,765  Audit, compliance and tax related fees 236  329  2,537  946  Directors’ fees 131  113  262  229  Other general and administrative expenses 3,057  4,027  7,124  6,892  Total operating expenses $ 106,212  $ 89,819  $ 209,620  $ 177,924  Total gross and net base management fee was $38,882 and $33,843 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in total gross base management fee is directly related to an increase in average total assets.
Total gross base management fee was $77,196 and $66,046 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in total gross base management fee is directly related to a increase in average total assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we incurred $22,505 and 19,589 of income incentive fees, respectively. This increase was driven by a corresponding increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income (net of preferred stock dividends) from $97,944 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $112,555 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we incurred $44,131 and $39,329 of income incentive fees, respectively. This increase was driven by a corresponding increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income (net of preferred stock dividends) from $196,646 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $220,687 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we incurred $37,783 and $29,679 respectively, of interest and credit facility expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes® (collectively, our “Notes”). During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we incurred $71,653 and $57,717, respectively, of interest expenses related to our Notes. These expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those periods and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those periods. The table below describes the various expenses of our Notes and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness during these years: 130   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest on borrowings $ 34,255  $ 25,292  $ 65,066  $ 49,537  Amortization of deferred financing costs 1,790  2,190  3,482  4,105  Accretion of discount on unsecured debt 772  746  1,539  1,319  Facility commitment fees 966  1,451  1,566  2,756  Total interest and credit facility expenses $ 37,783  $ 29,679  $ 71,653  $ 57,717  Average principal debt outstanding $ 2,840,667  $ 2,477,511  $ 2,843,085  $ 2,378,136  Annualized weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (1) 4.82  % 4.08  % 4.58  % 4.17  % Annualized weighted average interest rate on borrowings (2) 5.32  % 4.79  % 5.04  % 4.85  % (1) Includes only the stated interest expense. (2) Includes the stated interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of discount on Public Notes and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility. Interest expense increased from $25,292 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $34,255 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) increased from 4.08% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 4.82% for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings increased from 4.79% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 5.32% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Both increases are primarily due to an increase of interest expense from increased LIBOR rates for our Revolving Credit Facility offset by a decrease of interest expense from redemptions of our Prospect Capital InterNotes® and issuances of these notes at lower rates, as well as repurchases of our Convertible Notes and June 2029 Baby Bond. Interest expense increased from $49,537 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $65,066 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) increased from 4.17% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 4.58% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings increased from 4.85% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 5.04% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Both increases are primarily due to an increase of interest expense from increased LIBOR rates for our Revolving Credit Facility offset by a decrease of interest expense from redemptions of our Prospect Capital InterNotes® and issuances of these notes at lower rates, as well as repurchases of our Convertible Notes and June 2029 Baby Bond. The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $3,618 and $2,239 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $6,717 and $6,765 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of $271 and $4,315 directly from our portfolio companies, and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal services during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, we were given a credit in the amount of $1,212 for legal expenses incurred on behalf of our portfolio companies that were remitted to Prospect Administration during the six months ended December 31, 2022. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration’s charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount. Total operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration (“Other Operating Expenses”), net of any expense reimbursements, were $3,424 and $4,469 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in other general and administrative expenses offset by an increase in legal fees. Total operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration (“Other Operating Expenses”), net of any expense reimbursements, were $9,923 and $8,067 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in audit, compliance and tax related fees. 131 Net Realized Gains (Losses)

The $104,163 decrease is primarily driven by a $677,705 decrease in originations offset by a $537,916 increase in repayments for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. There were no investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Financing activities provided $232,144 and $283,001 of cash during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which included dividend payments of $140,516 and $131,356, respectively. The $50,857 decrease in cash provided by our financing activities is primarily driven by a $266,386 decrease in net debt repayments, offset by a $227,585
134 increase in issuance of preferred stock, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Our primary uses of funds have been to continue to invest in portfolio companies, through both debt and equity investments, repay outstanding borrowings and to make cash distributions to our stockholders. Our primary sources of funds have historically been issuances of debt and equity. We have and may continue to fund a portion of our cash needs through repayments and opportunistic sales of our existing investment portfolio. We may also securitize a portion of our investments in unsecured or senior secured loans or other assets. Our objective is to put in place such borrowings in order to enable us to expand our portfolio. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed 628,400 and we made repayments totaling 713,559 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, our outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $754,305. As of December 31, 2022, we had, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, $154,144 outstanding on the Convertible Notes, $1,343,766 outstanding on the Public Notes and $343,114 outstanding on the Prospect Capital InterNotes® (See “Capitalization” above). Undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans to our portfolio companies incur commitment and unused fees ranging from 0.00% to 7.25%. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had $85,075 and $43,934, respectively, of undrawn revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments to our portfolio companies. The fair value of our undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans was zero as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. On February 13, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-236415) that was effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act as permitted under the Small Business Credit Availability Act. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, an indeterminate amount of securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our securities, warrants representing rights to purchase our securities or separately tradable units combining two or more of our securities.
Preferred Stock On August 3, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with Preferred Capital Securities, LLC (“PCS”), as amended on June 9, 2022 and October 7, 2022, pursuant to which PCS has agreed to serve as the Company’s agent, principal distributor and dealer manager for the Company’s offering of up to 60,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the
5.50% Series A1 Preferred Stock (“Series A1 Preferred Stock”) , the
5.50% Series M1 Preferred Stock (“Series M1 Preferred Stock”) , the
5.50% Series M2 Preferred Stock (“Series M2 Preferred Stock”), the 6.50% Series A3 Preferred Stock (“Series A3 Preferred Stock”), and the 6.50% Series M3 Preferred Stock (“Series M3 Preferred Stock”) . In connection with such offering, on August 3, 2020, June 9, 2022 and Octoebr 11, 2022, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (“SDAT”), reclassifying and designating 120,000,000, 60,000,000 and 120,000,000 shares, respectively, of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as “Convertible Preferred Stock.” On October 30, 2020, and as amended on February 18, 2022 and October 7, 2022, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with InspereX LLC, pursuant to which InspereX LLC has agreed to serve as the Company’s agent and dealer manager for the Company’s offering of up to 10,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the 5.50% Series AA1 Preferred Stock (the “Series AA1 Preferred Stock”), the 5.50% Series MM1 Preferred Stock (the “Series MM1 Preferred Stock”), the 6.50% Series AA2 Preferred Stock (the “Series AA2 Preferred Stock”), and the 6.50% Series MM2 Preferred Stock (the “Series MM2 Preferred Stock” and together with the Series M1 Preferred Stock, the Series M2 Preferred Stock, and the Series M3 Preferred Stock, the “Series M Preferred Stock” and the Series MM2 Preferred Stock, together with the Series AA2 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock and the Series M3 Preferred Stock, the “6.50% Preferred Stock”). In connection with such offering, on October 30, 2020, February 17, 2022 and October 11, 2022, we filed Articles Supplementary with the SDAT, reclassifying and designating an additional 80,000,000 shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of 187,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of
5.50% Series A2 Preferred Stock , with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (the “Series A2 Preferred Stock”, and together with the Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series M1 Preferred Stock, Series M2 Preferred Stock, Series AA1 Preferred Stock, and Series MM1 Preferred Stock, the “ 5.50% Preferred Stock ”). The issuance of the Series A2 Preferred Stock settled on May 26, 2021. In connection with such offering, on May 19, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with the SDAT, reclassifying and designating an additional 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. 135 In connection with the offerings of the 5.50% Preferred Stock and the 6.50% Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the “Preferred Stock Plan” or the “Preferred Stock DRIP”), pursuant to which holders of the 5.50% Preferred Stock and the 6.50% Preferred Stock will have dividends on their 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock, at a price per share of $25.00, if they elect. Each series of 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness .
See Note 8,
Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding
for further discussion on our senior securities.
At any time prior to the listing of the 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the 5.50% Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the 5.50% Preferred Stock and the 6.50% Preferred Stock (the “Holder Optional Conversion”). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (such arithmetic average, the “5-day VWAP”). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA2 Preferred Stock and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, “Settlement Amount” means (A) $25.00 per share (the “Stated Value”), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Holder Optional Conversion Fee for the respective Holder Conversion Deadline. For the Series M Preferred Stock, “Settlement Amount” means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any. “Series M Clawback”, if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange. Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock has been issued, or, for listed shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, five years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates, the “Redemption Eligibility Date”), such share of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the “Issuer Optional Redemption”), at a redemption price of 100% of the Stated Value of the shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. Subject to certain limitations, each share of 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the “Issuer Optional Conversion”). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the 5-day VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the 5-day VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock, “IOC Settlement Amount” means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the 5-day VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without
136 limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, the holder of such 5.50% Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such 5.50% Preferred Stock or 6.50% Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion. On July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of 6,000,000 shares, or $150,000 in aggregate liquidation preference, of our
5.35% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock , par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock” or “5.35% Preferred Stock”), at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offer settled on July 19, 2021, and no additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued pursuant to the option. In connection with such offering, on July 15, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with SDAT, reclassifying and designating 6,900,000 shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
The Series A Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness .
See Note 8,
Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding
for further discussion on our senior securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, at any time after the close of business on July 19, 2026 (any such date, an “Optional Redemption Date”), at our sole option, we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or, from time to time, in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. We may also redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or, from time to time, in part, including prior to the Optional Redemption Date, pro rata, based on liquidation preference, with all other series of our then outstanding preferred stock, in the event that our Board determines to redeem any series of our preferred stock, in whole or, from time to time, in part, because such redemption is deemed necessary by the Board to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act or for us to maintain RIC status. In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below), we may, at our option, exercise our special optional redemption right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred by paying the liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for such redemption. To the extent that we exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not be permitted to exercise the conversion right described below in respect of their shares called for redemption. Except to the extent that we have elected to exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right by providing notice of redemption prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of our shares of common stock per Series A Preferred Stock to be converted equal to the lesser of: • the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Record Date for a Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and • 6.03865, subject to certain adjustments, subject, in each case, to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration upon conversion as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we have provided or provide a redemption notice with respect to some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of any Series A Preferred Stock that we have called for redemption will not be permitted to exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right in respect of any of their Series A Preferred Stock that have been called for redemption, and any Series A Preferred Stock subsequently called for redemption that have been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the applicable date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date.
137 For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a redemption upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the following definitions are applicable: “Change of Control Triggering Event” means the occurrence of any of the following: • the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Controlled Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than to any Permitted Holders); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, a pledge of assets pursuant to any of our secured debt instruments or the secured debt instruments of our Controlled Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be any such sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or disposition; or • the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than any Permitted Holders) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of any of the transactions referred to in the bullet points above will not be deemed a Change of Control Triggering Event if we or the acquiring or surviving consolidated entity has or continues to have a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or is otherwise listed or quoted on a national securities exchange. The “Change of Control Conversion Date” is the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be converted, which will be a business day selected by us that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. The “Common Stock Price” will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by the holders of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of our common stock or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by holders of our common stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of our common stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our common stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for our common stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event, if our common stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. “Controlled Subsidiary” means any of our subsidiaries, 50% or more of the outstanding equity interests of which are owned by us and our direct or indirect subsidiaries and of which we possess, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies, whether through the ownership of voting equity interests, by agreement or otherwise. “Excluded Transaction” means (i) any transaction that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of our Voting Stock; (ii) any changes resulting from a subdivision or combination or a change solely in par value; (iii) any transaction where the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (iv) any transaction if (A) we become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (B)(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) immediately following that transaction no “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company; or (v) any transaction primarily for the purpose of changing our jurisdiction of incorporation or form of organization. “Permitted Holders” means (i) us, (ii) one or more of our Controlled Subsidiaries and (iii) Prospect Capital Management or any affiliate of Prospect Capital Management that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction located in the United States of America and in the business of managing or advising clients. “Voting Stocks” as applied to stock of any person, means shares, interests, participations or other equivalents in the equity interest (however designated) in such person having ordinary voting power for the election of the directors (or the equivalent) of such person, other than shares, interests, participations or other equivalents having such power only by reason of the occurrence of a contingency. 138 Except as provided above in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. For so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, we will not exercise any option we have to convert any other series of our outstanding preferred stock to common stock, including the Issuer Optional Conversion, or any other security ranking junior to such preferred stock. As a result, and in accordance with ASC 480, we have presented both our 5.50% Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock within temporary equity on our
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
as of September 30, 2022. We determined the estimated value as of December 31, 2022 of our 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock, with a $25.00 stated value per share. We engaged a third-party valuation service to assist in our determination based on the calculation resulting from the total equity on our
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities
in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (the “Form 10-Q”), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, adjusted for the fair value of our investments (i.e. from our
Consolidated Schedule of Investments ) and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our Preferred Stock outstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of our 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock, the estimated value of our 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2022 is $25.00 per share.
Common Stock Our common stockholders’ equity accounts as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our dividend reinvestment plan and in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies and in connection with our 5.50%     and 6.50% Preferred Stock Holder Optional Conversion and Optional Redemption Following Death of a Holder. When our common stock is issued, the related offering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us.
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock for the six months ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Repurchase Program is $ 65,860 . On June 10, 2022, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale).

Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of rising interest rates in response to inflation, the war in Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. Concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Relating to Our Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates impacting some of the loans in our portfolio which have floating interest rates. Additionally, because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Relating to Our Business - Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our debt investments may be based on floating rates or fixed rates. For our floating rate loans the rates are determined from the LIBOR, EURO Interbank Offer Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or the Prime Rate. The floating interest rate loans may be subject to a LIBOR or SOFR floor. Our loans typically have durations of one, two, three, six or twelve months after which they reset to current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, 82.61% of the interest earning investments in our portfolio, at fair value, bore interest at floating rates.
140 Interest on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are based on a floating rate of one-month SOFR plus 205 basis points with no minimum SOFR floor and an outstanding balance of $754,305 as of December 31, 2022. Lender fees charged on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes, Public Notes, and Prospect Capital InterNotes® bear interest at fixed rates.
On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that (i) 24 LIBOR settings would cease to exist immediately after December 31, 2021 (all seven euro LIBOR settings; all seven Swiss franc LIBOR settings; the Spot Next, 1-week, 2-month, and 12-month Japanese yen LIBOR settings; the overnight, 1-week, 2-month, and 12-month sterling LIBOR settings; and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR settings); (ii) the overnight and 12-month US LIBOR settings would cease to exist after June 30, 2023; and (iii) the FCA would consult on whether the remaining nine LIBOR settings should continue to be published on a synthetic basis for a certain period using the FCA’s proposed new powers that the UK government is legislating to grant to them. The following table shows the approximate annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for floating rate instruments, excluding our investments in Subordinated Structured Notes) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: (in thousands) Basis Point Change Increase (Decrease) in Interest Income (Increase) Decrease in Interest Expense Increase (Decrease) in Net Investment Income Increase (Decrease) in Net Investment Income
(1) Up 300 basis points $ 148,332  $ (22,629) $ 125,703  $ 100,562  Up 200 basis points $ 102,527  $ (15,086) $ 87,441  $ 69,953  Up 100 basis points $ 56,721  $ (7,543) $ 49,178  $ 39,342  Down 100 basis points $ (34,728) $ 32,888  $ (1,840) $ (1,472) Down 200 basis points $ (78,728) $ 32,888  $ (45,840) $ (36,672) Down 300 basis points $ (116,212) $ 32,888  $ (83,324) $ (66,659) (1) Includes the impact of income incentive fees. See Note 13 in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements
for more information on income incentive fees. As of December 31, 2022, one, three, and six month LIBOR were
4.39%, 4.77% and
5.14%,
respectively. As of December 31, 2022 the one, three, and six month SOFR were
4.36%, 4.59%, and 4.78% respectively . We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the period ended December 31, 2022, we did not engage in hedging activities. 141 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2022, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that due to the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects the Company’s financial condition, results of its operations, changes in its net assets and temporary equity and its cash flows for the periods presented. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have begun the process of, and we are focused on, enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following: • Enhancing existing controls that address the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the performance of management review controls over the valuation of CLOs;
• Enhancing policies and procedures to retain adequate documentary evidence for certain management review controls over the valuation of CLOs, including precision of review and evidence of review procedures performed to demonstrate effective operation of such controls; • Enhancing policies and procedures to adequately demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment and develop proper monitoring controls around timely evaluation and communication of internal control deficiencies to those parties responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and the board of directors, as appropriate. We believe our planned actions to enhance our processes and controls will address the material weaknesses, but these actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation, and we will need a period of execution to demonstrate remediation. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 142 PART II Item 1. Legal Proceedings (All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.) From time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These matters may relate to intellectual property, employment, tax, regulation, contract or other matters. The resolution of such matters as may arise will be subject to various uncertainties and, even if such claims are without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
We are not aware of any material legal proceedings as of December 31, 2022. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below and the risk factors in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
(All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.) Risks Relating to Our Investments Investments in covenant-lite loans may expose us to different and increased risks.
Although we generally expect the transaction documentation of some portion of our investments to include covenants and other structural protections, a significant portion of our investments may be composed of so-called “covenant-lite loans.” Generally, covenant-lite loans do not have certain maintenance covenants that would require the issuer to maintain debt service or other financial ratios. Ownership of covenant-lite loans may expose us to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have financial maintenance covenants. As a result, our exposure to losses from these loans may be increased. In addition, in the current economic environment, the market prices of covenant-lite loans may be depressed. Risks Relating to Our Securities Senior securities, including debt and preferred equity, expose us to additional risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use our revolving credit facility to leverage our portfolio and we expect in the future to borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks and other lenders and may securitize certain of our portfolio investments. We also have the Unsecured Notes outstanding and have launched a convertible preferred share offering program, which are forms of leverage and are senior in payment rights to our common stock. Business development companies are generally able to issue senior securities such that their asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. In March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act added Section 61(a)(2) to the 1940 Act, a successor provision to Section 61(a)(1) referenced therein, which reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. On May 5, 2020, the Company's stockholders voted to approve the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) to the Company effective as of May 6, 2020. As a result of the stockholder approval, effective May 6, 2020, the asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act applicable to the Company decreased to 150% from 200%. In other words, under the 1940 Act, the Company is now able to borrow $2 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity, as opposed to borrowing $1 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. As a result, the Company will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future and investors in the Company may face increased investment risk. In addition, the Company’s management fee payable to the Investment Adviser is based on the Company's average adjusted gross assets, which includes leverage and, as a result, if the Company incurs additional leverage, management fees paid to the Investment Adviser would increase. With certain limited exceptions, as a BDC, we are only allowed to borrow amounts or otherwise issue senior securities such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing or other issuance. The amount of leverage
143 that we employ will depend on the Investment Adviser’s and our Board of Directors’ assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. There is no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful. Leverage involves risks and special considerations for stockholders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following: • A likelihood of greater volatility in the net asset value and market price of our common stock; • Diminished operating flexibility as a result of asset coverage or investment portfolio composition requirements required by lenders or investors that are more stringent than those imposed by the 1940 Act; • The possibility that investments will have to be liquidated at less than full value or at inopportune times to comply with debt covenants or to pay interest or dividends on the leverage; • Increased operating expenses due to the cost of leverage, including issuance and servicing costs; • Convertible or exchangeable securities, such as the Convertible Notes outstanding or those issued in the future (including the Preferred Stock (as defined herein)) may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock including, the case of the Preferred Stock, the statutory right under the 1940 Act to vote, as a separate class, on the election of two of our directors and approval of certain fundamental transactions in certain circumstances; • Subordination to lenders’ superior claims on our assets as a result of which lenders will be able to receive proceeds available in the case of our liquidation before any proceeds will be distributed to our stockholders; • Difficulty meeting our payment and other obligations under the Unsecured Notes and our other outstanding debt or preferred equity; • The occurrence of an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and/or other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, including the credit agreement and each indenture governing the Unsecured Notes, which event of default could result in all or some of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; • Reduced availability of our cash flow to fund investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • The risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under our amended senior credit facility; and • Reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy. For example, the amount we may borrow under our revolving credit facility is determined, in part, by the fair value of our investments. If the fair value of our investments declines, we may be forced to sell investments at a loss to maintain compliance with our borrowing limits. Other debt facilities we may enter into in the future may contain similar provisions. Any such forced sales would reduce our net asset value and also make it difficult for the net asset value to recover. The Investment Adviser and our Board of Directors in their best judgment nevertheless may determine to use leverage if they expect that the benefits to our stockholders of maintaining the leveraged position will outweigh the risks. • In addition, our ability to meet our payment and other obligations of the Preferred Stock, the Unsecured Notes and our credit facility depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the Preferred Stock, the Unsecured Notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and preferred equity obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt or preferred equity, including the Unsecured Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the Preferred Stock, the Unsecured Notes and our other debt. 144 Illustration.     The following tables illustrate the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of interest expense. The calculations in the tables below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.
The below calculation assumes (i) $8.4 billion in total assets, (ii) an average cost of funds of 5.35% (including preferred dividend payments), (iii) $2.6 billion in debt outstanding, (iv) $0.9 billion in liquidation preference of 5.50% Preferred Stock outstanding, (v) $0.15 billion in 5.35% Preferred Stock outstanding, (vi) $0.9 billion in liquidation preference of 6.50% Preferred Stock outstanding, and (vi) $3.9 billion of common stockholders’ equity.

(2) Assumes the conversion of $0.9 billion in 5.50% Preferred Stock and $0.9 billion in 6.50% Preferred Stock at a conversion rate based on the 5-day VWAP of our common stock on December 31, 2022, which was $7.06, and a Holder Optional Conversion Fee (as defined in the prospectus supplement relating to the applicable offering) of 9.00% on Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A3 Preferred Stock, and Series AA2 Preferred Stock of the maximum public offering price disclosed within the applicable prospectus supplements. The actual 5-day VWAP of our common stock on a Holder Conversion Exercise Date may be more or less than $7.06, which may result in more or less shares of common stock issued. The assumed portfolio return is required by regulation of the SEC and is not a prediction of, and does not represent, our projected or actual performance. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table. Pursuant to SEC regulations, this table is calculated as of December 31, 2022. As a result, it has not been updated to take into account any changes in assets or leverage since December 31, 2022. General Risk Factors We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the level of structuring fees received, the interest or dividend rates payable on the debt or equity securities we hold, the default rate on debt securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 145 Item 5. Other Information Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PSEC.” The following table sets forth, for the quarterly reporting periods indicated, the net asset value per common share of our common stock and the high and low sales prices for our common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Our common stock historically has traded at prices both above and below its net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that such premium or discount, as applicable, to net asset value will be maintained. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 for additional information about the risks and uncertainties we face.         Stock Price   Premium (Discount) of High to NAV   Premium (Discount) of Low to NAV       NAV(1)   High(2)   Low(2)   Year Ended June 30, 2021                     First quarter   $ 8.40    $ 5.17     $ 4.69     ( 38.5 ) %   ( 44.2 ) %   Second quarter   8.96    5.60     4.95     ( 37.5 ) %   ( 44.8 ) %   Third quarter 9.38  7.98   5.51   ( 14.9 ) % ( 41.3 ) % Fourth quarter

The current approval to sell shares of our common stock below our NAV per common share is valid until June 10, 2023 and subject to certain conditions as set forth
146 in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25% of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale). Accordingly, we may make offerings of our common stock without any limitation on the total amount of dilution to stockholders. Our prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to this offering contains additional information about these offerings. Pursuant to the authority granted by our stockholders and the approval of our Board of Directors, we have made the following offerings: Date of Offering Price Per Share to Investors Shares Issued Estimated Net Asset Value per Common Share(1) Percentage Dilution June 15, 2020 to June 22, 2020(2) $5.29 - $5.40 1,158,222 $7.93 - 7.94 0.10% (1) The data for sales of common shares below NAV pursuant to our equity distribution agreements are estimates based on our last reported NAV prior to the respective period adjusted for capital events occurring during the period since the last calculated NAV. All amounts presented are approximations based on the best available data at the time of issuance.

The settlement dates are two business days later than the sale dates. 147 FEES AND EXPENSES The following tables are intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. These tables are based on our assets and common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022, except that we assume that we have issued $0.9 billion in 5.50% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 5.50% per annum, $0.9 billion in 6.50% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 6.50% per annum, in addition to our $0.15 billion of 5.35% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 5.35% per annum, and that we have borrowed $1.7 billion under our credit facility, which is the maximum amount available under the credit facility with the current levels of other debt, in addition to our other indebtedness of $1.9 billion. Except where the context suggests otherwise, any reference to fees or expenses paid by “you” or “us” or that “we” will pay fees or expenses, the Company will pay such fees and expenses out of our net assets and, consequently, you will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as an investor in the Company’s common stock. However, you will not be required to deliver any money or otherwise bear personal liability or responsibility for such fees or expenses.

In calculating the following expense amounts, we have assumed we have issued $0.9 billion in 5.50% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 5.50% per annum, $0.9 billion in 6.50% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 6.50% per annum, $0.15 billion in 5.35% Preferred Stock paying dividends of 5.35% per annum, we have borrowed $1.7 billion available under our line of credit, in addition to our other indebtedness of $1.9 billion, and that our annual operating expenses would remain at the levels set forth in the table above and that we would pay the costs shown in the table above.     1 Year   3 Years   5 Years   10 Years Ongoing Preferred Stock Offerings (1)
- You would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment in shares of our common stock, assuming a 5% annual return on our portfolio*   $ 178     $ 405     $ 594     $ 942   Ongoing Preferred Stock Offerings (1)
- You would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment in shares of our common stock, assuming a 5% annual return on our portfolio** $ 187  $ 427  $ 623  $ 969  * Assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on our portfolio. 148 ** Assumes no unrealized capital depreciation or realized capital losses and 5% annual return on our portfolio resulting entirely from net realized capital gains (and therefore subject to the capital gains incentive fee). While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return on our portfolio, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. The income incentive fee under our Investment Advisory Agreement with Prospect Capital Management is unlikely to be material assuming a 5% annual return on our portfolio and is not included in the example. If we achieve sufficient returns on our portfolio, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our distributions to our common stockholders and our expenses would likely be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and other distributions at NAV, common stockholders that participate in our common stock dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by 95% of the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the distribution. This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown. (1)    Includes up to a 7.0% selling commission on the $25.00 per share (the “Stated Value”) paid by the Company and a dealer manager fee equal to 3.0% of the Stated Value paid by the Company. Reductions in selling commissions will be reflected in reduced public offering prices as described in the “Plan of Distribution” section of the applicable prospectus supplement and the net proceeds to us will not be impacted by such reductions; therefore, we will bear a reduction in net proceeds to us up to 7.0% of the Stated Value on all A Shares although the selling commission compensation paid by us to our dealer manager may represent less than 7.0% of the Stated Value. We may, through the Holder Optional Conversion Fee, recoup a portion of the Sales Load if stockholders exercise a Holder Optional Conversion (as defined in the prospectus supplement relating to the applicable offering) of their Preferred Stock prior to the 5-year anniversary of the original issue date. The Holder Optional Conversion Fee is 9.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of such Preferred Stock, 8.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the first anniversary but prior to the second anniversary, 7.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, 6.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the third anniversary but prior to the fourth anniversary, 5.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the fourth anniversary but prior to the fifth anniversary and 0.00% on or after the fifth anniversary. (2)    Includes a dealer manager fee equal to 3.0% of the Stated Value paid by the Company. (3)     Includes up to a 4.875% selling commission on the $25.00 per share (the “Stated Value”) paid by the Company and a dealer manager fee equal to 0.125% of the Stated Value paid by the Company. For the AA1 Shares and AA2 Shares we may, through the Holder Optional Conversion Fee, recoup a portion of the Sales Load if stockholders exercise a Holder Optional Conversion (as defined in the prospectus supplement relating to the applicable offering) of their Preferred Stock prior to the 5-year anniversary of the original issue date. The Holder Optional Conversion Fee is 9.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of such Preferred Stock, 8.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the first anniversary but prior to the second anniversary, 7.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, 6.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the third anniversary but prior to the fourth anniversary, 5.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the fourth anniversary but prior to the fifth anniversary and 0.00% on or after the fifth anniversary. (4)    The selling commission and dealer manager fee, when combined with organization and offering expenses (including due diligence expenses and fees for establishing servicing arrangements for new stockholder accounts), are not expected to exceed 11.5% of the gross offering proceeds. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, authorize the Company to incur underwriting and other offering expenses in excess of 11.5% of the gross offering proceeds. In no event will the combined selling commission, dealer manager fee and offering expenses exceed FINRA’s limit on underwriting and other offering expenses. (5)    The selling commission and dealer manager fee, when combined with organization and offering expenses (including due diligence expenses), are not expected to exceed 6.0% of the gross offering proceeds. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, authorize the Company to incur underwriting and other offering expenses in excess of 6.0% of the gross offering proceeds. In no event will the combined selling commission, dealer manager fee and offering expenses exceed FINRA’s limit on underwriting and other offering expenses. 149 (6)    The expenses of the Preferred DRIP are included in “other expenses.” See “Capitalization” in the applicable prospectus supplement. (7)     Our base management fee is 2% of our gross assets (which include any amount borrowed,  i.e. , total assets without deduction for any liabilities, including any borrowed amounts for non-investment purposes, for which purpose we have not and have no intention of borrowing). Although no plans are in place to borrow the full amount under our line of credit, assuming that we borrowed $1.7 billion, the 2% management fee of gross assets equals approximately 4.79% of net assets. (8)    Based on our net investment income and realized capital gains, less realized and unrealized capital losses, earned on our portfolio for the six months ended December 31, 2022, all of which consisted of an income incentive fee. This historical amount has been adjusted to reflect the issuance of 70,187,000 shares of combined 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock. The capital gain incentive fee is paid without regard to pre-incentive fee income. For a more detailed discussion of the calculation of the two-part incentive fee, see “Management Services-Investment Advisory Agreement” in the applicable prospectus. (9)    As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.9 billion outstanding of Unsecured Notes (as defined below) in various maturities, ranging from March 15, 2023 to March 15, 2052, and interest rates, ranging from 1.50% to 6.625%, some of which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at various conversion rates. (10)     “Other expenses” are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. The amount shown above represents annualized expenses during our six months ended December 31, 2022 representing all of our estimated recurring operating expenses (except fees and expenses reported in other items of this table) that are deducted from our operating income and reflected as expenses in our Statement of Operations. The estimate of our overhead expenses, including payments under an administration agreement with Prospect Administration, or the Administration Agreement is based on our projected allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. See “Business-Management Services-Administration Agreement” in the applicable prospectus. (11)    If all 70,187,000 shares of combined 5.50% Preferred Stock and 6.50% Preferred Stock were converted into common stock and assuming all the Series A1, Series A3, and Series AA2 Preferred Stock pay a Holder Optional Conversion Fee of 9.00% of the maximum public offering price disclosed within the applicable prospectus supplement and are converted at a conversion rate based on the 5-day VWAP of our common stock on December 31, 2022, which was $7.06, then management fees would be 3.31%, incentive fees payable under our Investment Advisory Agreement would be 1.56%, total advisory fees would be 4.86%, total interest expenses would be 3.52%, other expenses would be 0.58%, and total annual expenses would be 8.97% of net assets attributable to our common stock. The actual 5-day VWAP of our common stock on a conversion date may be more or less than $7.06, which may result in fees that are higher or lower than those described herein. These figures are based on the same assumptions described in the other notes to this fee table.
(12)    Based on the 5.50% per annum dividend rate applicable to the A1 Shares, M1 Shares, M2 Shares, AA1 Shares, MM1 Shares, and A2 Shares. Also based on the 5.35% per annum dividend rate applicable to the A Shares. Also based on the 6.50% per annum dividend rate applicable to the A3 Shares, M3 Shares, AA2 Shares, and MM2 Shares. Other series of preferred stock, including other series of preferred stock being sold in different offerings, may bear different annual dividend rates. No dividend will be paid on shares of Preferred Stock after they have been converted to shares of common stock. (13)     The indirect expenses associated with the Company’s investments in collateralized loan obligations are not included in the fee table presentation, but if such expenses were included in the fee table presentation then the Company’s total annual expenses would have been 13.57%, or 16.47% after dividends on Preferred Stock. 150 Financial Highlights
