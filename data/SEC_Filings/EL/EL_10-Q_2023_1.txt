NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Certain prior year amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Descriptions of the Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Management evaluates the related estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment, including those related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. Currency Translation and Transactions All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange for the period. Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. were $ 291
million and $( 20 ) million, net of tax, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $( 61 ) million and $( 195 ) million, net of tax, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the Company’s subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings. These subsidiaries are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or liquidity. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. See  Note 4 – Derivative Financial Instruments  for further discussion .  The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions of $ 20
million and $( 6 ) million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 34
million and $( 18 ) million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 6 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concentration of Credit Risk The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and seller of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The Company’s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to retailers in its travel retail business, department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers and perfumeries. The Company grants credit to qualified customers. While the Company does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk at this time, it continues to monitor its customers' abilities, individually and collectively, to make timely payments.
The Company’s largest customer during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 sells products primarily in China travel retail. This customer accounted for $ 242
million, or
12 %, and $ 399
million, or
24 %, of the Company's accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

million and $ 266
million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s manufacturing process is included in Cost of sales, and all other depreciation and amortization is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. 7 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes The effective rate for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Effective rate for income taxes 25.4   % 21.5   % 23.9   % 21.9   % Basis-point change from the prior-year period 390   200   For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements and a higher effective tax rate on the Company's foreign operations, partially offset by a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 1% excise tax on share repurchases and a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income. The excise tax is effective beginning with the Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. The corporate alternative minimum tax will be effective beginning with the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company continues to monitor developments and evaluate projected impacts, if any, of this provision to its consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaled $ 58
million and $ 61
million, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $ 49
million. The total gross interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $ 1
million and $ 2
million, respectively. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at each of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, was $ 15
million and $ 14  million, respectively. On the basis of the information available as of December 31, 2022, the Company does not expect significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. During the fiscal 2023 first quarter, the Company formally concluded the compliance process with respect to its fiscal 2021 income tax return under the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”), which had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Other Accrued and Noncurrent Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consist of the following: (In millions) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Advertising, merchandising and sampling $ 284   $ 250   Employee compensation 473   693   Deferred revenue 344   312   Payroll and other non-income taxes 308   345   Accrued income taxes 343   267   Sales return accrual 293   252   Other 1,494   1,241   $ 3,539   $ 3,360   At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, total Other noncurrent liabilities of $ 1,487  million and $ 1,651  million included $ 636  million and $ 692  million of deferred tax liabilities, respectively. 8 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Recently Issued Accounting Standards FASB ASU No. 2022-04 – Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations In September 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The guidance requires companies that use supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. Effective for the Company
– The guidance becomes effective for the Company’s first quarter fiscal 2024 and is applied on a retrospective basis, except for the requirement to disclose rollforward information which is effective prospectively for the Company’s first quarter fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Annual disclosures need to be provided in interim periods within the initial year of adoption. Impact on consolidated financial statements –
The Company has a supplier financing arrangement and will apply the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments. Reference Rate Reform (ASC Topic 848
“ ASC 848 ” ) In March 2020, t he FAS B issued authoritative guidance to provide optional relief for companies preparing for the discontinuation of interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and applies to lease and other contracts, hedging instruments, held-to-maturity debt securities and debt arrangements that reference LIBOR or another rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that makes amendments to the new rules on accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments clar ify that for all derivative instruments affected by the changes to interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment, regardless of whether they reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform, an entity may apply certain practical expedients in ASC 848. In December 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer the sunset date of ASC 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. Effective for the Company
– This guidance can only be applied for a limited time through December 31, 2024. Impact on consolidated financial statements –
The Company currently has an implementation team in place that has performed a comprehensive evaluation and is assessing the impact of applying this guidance, which includes assessing the impact to business processes and internal controls over financial reporting and the related disclosure requirements. For treasury related arrangements, the Company references LIBOR in its interest rate swap agreements and LIBOR is also used for purposes of discounting certain foreign currency and interest rate forward contracts. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of modifying treasury related arrangements and applying the relevant ASC 848 optional practical expedients, as needed. For existing lease, debt arrangements and other contracts, the Company will not adopt any ASC 848 optional practical expedients as it relates to these arrangements. The Company will continue to monitor new contracts that could potentially be eligible for contract modification relief through December 31, 2024. No other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment Testing During the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Smashbox reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 21  million reducing the carrying value to
zero .
During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022.
The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $ 100  million for Dr.Jart+ and $ 86  million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted-average cost of capital, which was
11 % and
13 %, respectively. A summary of the impairment charges for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and the remaining trademark and goodwill carrying values as of December 31, 2022, for each reporting unit, are as follows: Impairment Charge Carrying Value (In millions) Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2022 Reporting Unit: Geographic Region Trademarks Goodwill Trademarks Goodwill Smashbox The Americas $ 21   $ —   $ —   $ —   Dr. Jart+ Asia/Pacific 100   —   339   318   Too Faced The Americas 86   —   186   13   Total $ 207   $ —   $ 525   $ 331   The impairment charges for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were reflected in the skin care product category for Dr.Jart+ and the makeup product category for Smashbox and Too Faced. 11 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES Charges associated with the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were as follows: Sales Returns (included in Net Sales) Cost of Sales Operating Expenses Total (In millions) Restructuring Charges Other Charges Three months ended December 31, 2022 $ 1   $ —   $ 4   $ 3   $ 8   Six months ended December 31, 2022 $ 6   $ ( 1 ) $ 6   $ 3   $ 14   The types of activities included in restructuring and other charges, and the related accounting criteria, are described below. Charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program On August 20, 2020, the Company announced a
two-year
restructuring program, Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program (the “PCBA Program”), designed to realign the Company's business to address the dramatic shifts to its distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The PCBA Program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. It is expected to further strengthen the Company by building upon the foundational capabilities in which the Company has invested. The PCBA Program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of the Company’s distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company’s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. This program is expected to position the Company to better execute its long-term strategy while strengthening its financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimated a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of
2,500
to
3,000
positions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. The Company also estimated the closure over the duration of the PCBA Program of approximately
10 % to
15 % of its freestanding stores globally, primarily in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and in North America. As of June 30, 2022, the Company approved specific initiatives under the PCBA Program and expects to substantially complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023. Inclusive of approvals from inception through June 30, 2022, the Company estimates that the PCBA Program may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $ 500  million and $ 515  million, before taxes. Additional information about the PCBA Program approvals is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Specific actions taken since the PCBA Program inception include: • Optimize Digital Organization and Other Go-To-Market Organizations
– The Company approved initiatives to enhance its go-to-market capabilities and shift more resources to support online growth. These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.
12 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • Optimize Select Marketing, Brand and Global Functions
– The Company has started to reduce its corporate and certain of its brand office footprints and is moving toward the future of work in a post-COVID environment, by restructuring where and how its employees work and collaborate. In addition, the Company has approved initiatives to reduce organizational complexity and leverage scale across various Global functions. These actions will result in asset write-offs, employee severance, lease termination fees, and consulting and other professional services for the design and implementation of the future structures and processes.
• Optimize Distribution Network
– To help restore profitability to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in certain areas of its distribution network and, as part of a broader initiative to be completed in phases, the Company has approved initiatives to close a number of underperforming freestanding stores, counters and other retail locations, mainly in certain affiliates across all geographic regions, including the Company's travel retail network. These anticipated closures reflect changing consumer behaviors including higher demand for online and omnichannel capabilities. These activities will result in termination of contracts, a net reduction in workforce, product returns, and inventory and other asset write-offs. • Exit of the Global Distribution of BECCA Products
– In reviewing the Company's brand portfolio to improve efficiency and the sustainability of long-term investments, the decision was made to exit the global distribution of BECCA products due to its limited distribution, the ongoing decline in product demand and the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These activities resulted in charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, product returns, termination of contracts, and employee severance. The Company completed these initiatives during fiscal 2022. • Exit of Certain Designer Fragrance Licenses
– In reviewing the Company’s brand portfolio of fragrances and to focus on investing its resources on alternative opportunities for long-term growth and value creation globally, the Company announced that it would not be renewing its existing license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines when their respective terms expire in June 2023. The Company has since negotiated early termination agreements with each of the licensors effective June 30, 2022 and continued to sell products under these licenses until such time. These actions resulted in asset write-offs, including charges for the impairment of goodwill, employee-related costs, and consulting and legal fees. • Brand Transformation
– In reviewing the Company’s brand portfolio to accelerate growth within the makeup product category and to support long-term investments, the decision was made to strategically reposition Smashbox to capitalize on changing consumer preferences and to mitigate the impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the brand. These actions will result primarily in product returns and inventory write-offs. PCBA Program Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring charges are comprised of the following: Employee-Related Costs –
Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other statutory minimum benefits, if applicable. Asset-Related Costs
– Asset-related costs primarily consist of asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets in certain freestanding stores (including rights associated with commercial operating leases and operating lease right-of-use assets) that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as a direct result of a restructuring initiative. These costs also include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges relating to the exit of the global distribution of BECCA products. Contract Terminations
– Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration.
Other Exit Costs
– Other exit costs related to restructuring activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and employee outplacement for separated employees.
13 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other charges associated with restructuring activities are comprised of the following: Sales Returns and Cost of Sales
– Product returns (offset by the related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs or write-downs as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative to exit certain businesses or locations will be recorded as a component of Net sales and/or Cost of sales when estimable and reasonably assured.
Other Charges
– The Company approved other charges related to the design and implementation of approved initiatives, which are charged to Operating expenses as incurred and primarily include the following: • Consulting and other professional services for organizational design of the future structures and processes as well as the implementation thereof; • Temporary labor backfill; • Costs to establish and maintain a PMO for the duration of the PCBA Program, including internal costs for employees dedicated solely to project management activities, and other PMO-related expenses incremental to the Company’s ongoing operations (e.g., rent and utilities); and • Recruitment and training costs for new and reskilled employees to acquire and apply the capabilities needed to perform responsibilities as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative. The Company records approved charges associated with restructuring and other activities once the relevant accounting criteria have been met.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may enter into option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The Company enters into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s investment in these foreign operations due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Time value is excluded from the effectiveness assessment and is recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The net gain or loss on net investment hedges is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of accumulated OCI (“AOCI”) on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company’s investment. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022, the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $ 4,005  million. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
For each derivative contract entered into, where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. At inception, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively, and has elected to perform, after initial evaluation, qualitative effectiveness assessments of certain hedge relationships to support an ongoing expectation of high effectiveness, if effectiveness testing is required. If based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. 15 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of September 2024. Hedge effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the forward method, which includes time value in the effectiveness assessment. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $ 1,774
million.
The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.
For foreign currency hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to Net sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period Net sales. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective. The estimated net gain on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $ 28
million. The accumulated net gain on derivative instruments in AOCI was $ 83
million and $ 90
million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Fair Value Hedges The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $ 700  million and $ 300  million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on
three-month
LIBOR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. 20 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Net Investment Hedges The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. The net gain or loss on these contracts is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of AOCI on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company’s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of May 2023. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At December 31, 2022, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $ 1,037
million. Credit Risk As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least  two  nationally recognized rating agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $ 84
million at December 31, 2022. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote. NOTE 5 –
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment. The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1:    Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. Level 2:    Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3:    Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation. 21 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

for discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents –  Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds (classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy). Cash deposits in interest bearing accounts and time deposits are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts   –  The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to  12
months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than  12
months. Interest rate - related derivatives –  The fair values of the Company’s interest rate contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services. Current and long-term debt  –   The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, debt also includes finance lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value. The Company’s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. DECIEM stock options
– The stock option liability represents the employee stock options issued by DECIEM in replacement and exchange for certain vested and unvested DECIEM employee stock options previously issued by DECIEM, in connection with the Company's acquisition of DECIEM. The DECIEM stock options are subject to the terms and conditions of DECIEM's 2021 Stock Option Plan. The DECIEM stock option liability is measured using the Monte Carlo Method, which requires certain assumptions. Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes to the discount rates or volatilities would have a lesser effect. These inputs are categorized as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The DECIEM stock options are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through the period when the options are exercised or repurchased (i.e., when they are settled), with an offsetting entry to compensation expense.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments In November 2022, the Company signed an agreement to acquire the TOM FORD brand. The amount to be paid by the Company for the acquisition is approximately $ 2,300  million, net of a $ 250  million payment to the Company at closing from Marcolin S.p.A. and expects to close in the second half of fiscal 2023. The Company expects to fund this transaction through a combination of cash, debt and $ 300  million in deferred payments to the sellers that become due beginning in July 2025. In addition, the acquisition will result in the elimination of the existing license royalty payments on the Company's beauty business upon closing. In January 2023, the Company entered into a $ 2,000  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on January 2, 2024 (the “New Facility”) for liquidity support for the Company's commercial paper program and general corporate purposes, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. Interest rates on borrowings under the New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. In January 2023, the Company increased its commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States from $ 2,500  million to $ 4,500  million. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims), advertising, regulatory, employment, intellectual property, real estate, environmental, trade relations, tax, and privacy. Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, management’s assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings. Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for such litigation and legal proceedings are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. NOTE 9 –
STOCK PROGRAMS Additional information relating to the Company's stock programs and the DECIEM stock options are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. 26 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company's Stock Programs Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”), long-term PSUs, including long-term price-vested units and share units. Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation was $ 112
million and $ 113
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was $ 165
million and $ 192
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Options During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted stock options in respect of approximately  1.2
million shares of Class A Common Stock with an exercise price per share of $ 246.01  and a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $ 79.09 . The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 52
million. Restricted Stock Units During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted RSUs in respect of approximately  1.1
million shares of Class A Common Stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $ 246.16  that, at the time of grant, are scheduled to vest at
0.4
million,
0.4  million, and
0.3  million shares per year, in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, respectively. Vesting of RSUs is generally subject to the continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. The RSUs are generally accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement of the RSUs either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) and, as such, were generally valued at the closing market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Performance Share Units During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted PSUs with a target payout of approximately  0.1
million shares of Class A Common Stock with a grant date fair value per share of $ 246.15 , which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company’s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, all subject to continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. For PSUs granted, no settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold. PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
In September 2022, approximately  0.2
million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued, and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of the issuance, in settlement of  0.1
million PSUs with a performance period ended June 30, 2022. DECIEM Stock Options The DECIEM stock options are liability-classified awards as they are expected to be settled in cash and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through date of settlement. Total stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the exchange or replacement of and the remaining requisite service period of stock options. The total stock option expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material. There were
no
DECIEM stock options exercised during the six months ended December 31, 2022. 27 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and shares underlying PSUs and RSUs where the vesting conditions have been met. Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards. A reconciliation between the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 (In millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. $ 394   $ 1,088   $ 883   $ 1,780   Denominator: Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Basic 357.7   360.6   357.8   361.4   Effect of dilutive stock options 2.1   4.1   2.4 4.2 Effect of PSUs 0.1   0.2   0.1 0.2 Effect of RSUs 0.5   1.1   0.6 1.2 Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Diluted 360.4   366.0   360.9   367.0   Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share: Basic $ 1.10   $ 3.02   $ 2.47   $ 4.93   Diluted $ 1.09   $ 2.97   $ 2.45   $ 4.85   28 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The shares of Class A Common Stock underlying stock options, RSUs and PSUs that were excluded in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 (In millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Stock options 2.9 1.1 2.1 0.7 RSUs and PSUs 0.1 — 0.1 0.1 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,  0.4

SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Although the Company operates in
one
business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis. Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, and operating income (loss) before charges associated with restructuring and other activities. Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. The accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments are substantially the same as those for the consolidated financial statements, as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein. There has been no significant variance in the total or long-lived asset values associated with the Company’s segment data since June 30, 2022. 33 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

The net sales from the Company's travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, with the exception of net sales of Dr.Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific region. Operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in Europe, the Middle East & Africa is included in that region and in The Americas. 35 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

The net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices, due to strategic pricing actions, and mix shifts within and among product categories, geographic regions and distribution channels. The prices at which we sell our products vary by brand, distribution channel (e.g., wholesale or direct-to-consumer) and may also vary by country. Our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers. Prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products.
New product innovation includes the introduction of new products, as well as changes related to existing products or where they are sold, including reformulations, regional expansion, repackaging and sets. A product is considered "new innovation" for the twelve-month period following the initial shipment date. Our innovation is launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year. We continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. The impact of new product introductions, including timing compared to introductions in prior periods, also affects our results. 36 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See
Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  beginning on page 54 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Overview Business Update We are a leader in prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with high quality products and services. Within prestige beauty, we are well diversified by product category, geography, brand, product sub-category, channel, consumer segment and price point. This diversification allows us to leverage consumer analytics and insights with agility by deploying our brands to fast growing and profitable opportunities. These analytics and insights, combined with our creativity, inform our innovation to provide a broad, locally-relevant and inclusive range of prestige products allowing us to compete effectively for a greater share of a consumer's beauty routine. Elements of our strategy are described in the
Overview
on pages 30-32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as well as below. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to disrupt our operating environment through the first half of fiscal 2023, including the evolution of the COVID-19 environment, including restrictions in mainland China and the rising number of COVID cases (collectively "COVID-related impacts") affecting Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan, and retail traffic in mainland China. In Asia travel retail, these challenges led to prolonged store closures as well as the curtailment of travel and caused the tightening of inventory by certain of our retailers who had previously placed orders in anticipation of the return of travel that was since delayed. During the first half of fiscal 2023, our business was also negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, along with inflationary pressures and recession concerns that caused certain of our retailers in the United States to tighten inventory. While our monthly retail trends improved sequentially during the fiscal 2023 second quarter in the United States, the pace was slower than anticipated resulting in lower replenishment orders compared to the prior-year period.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales decreased 17%, reflecting the impacts of the challenges noted above. • Our skin care net sales declined 25%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 5%. The category continues to be pressured by the COVID-related impacts affecting Asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain of our retailers, retail traffic in mainland China and the Dr.Jart+ travel retail business in Korea. Lower replenishment orders in the United States also negatively impacted the category's growth. Despite these pressures, net sales benefited from higher net sales from The Ordinary and Bobbi Brown.
• Our makeup net sales declined 9%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 6%. The decline in makeup net sales reflects the COVID-related impacts affecting Asia travel retail and retail traffic in mainland China, partially offset by the continued progression towards recovery in parts of Asia/Pacific and Europe, Middle East & Africa.
• Our fragrance net sales decreased 3%, primarily due to the impact of the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances of 9% and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 6%. Overall the category benefited from increases in Estée Lauder and Clinique due to strong holiday performance, as well as the shift in consumer demand toward our luxury and artisanal offerings, including Le Labo and Tom Ford Beauty. • Our hair care net sales remained virtually flat, benefiting from the fiscal 2022 third quarter launch of The Ordinary’s hair care products, offset by lower net sales from Aveda, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 37 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive. Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. We are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity. We continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets. • Net sales in The Americas decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances, and the unfavorable impacts of lower replenishment orders in the United States. Offsetting the net sales decrease in The Americas was continued growth in Latin America, primarily led by our makeup category and successful performance during holiday and key shopping moments. • Net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa decreased 22%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 4%, primarily due to continued COVID-related impacts affecting Asia travel retail. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net sales in Turkey, driven by growth in our makeup category, and India, driven by growth in our skin care category. Net sales in Russia declined period-over-period, and, during the fiscal 2023 second quarter, we sold a limited selection of products to a reduced number of authorized retailers and completed the closure of all of our freestanding stores. Net sales in the United Kingdom declined period-over-period, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the continued recovery in the makeup product category.
• The continued COVID-related impacts affected our business in Greater China and the Dr.Jart+ travel retail business in Korea drove the net sales decline in Asia/Pacific of 17%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 9%. Net sales in Asia/Pacific benefited from growth in southeast Asia, led by the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, driven by our makeup and fragrance product categories. Outlook The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt business for us, retailers and other companies with which we do business. There have been, and are likely to continue to be, intermittent store closures and supply chain challenges. We are mindful that these trends may continue to impact the pace of recovery. We are seeing a continued and prolonged curtailment in international travel which is also affecting our travel retail business, particularly in Asia, which historically has been one of our fastest growth areas. The rising number of COVID cases that started in December continues to negatively impact the pace of recovery. In addition to impacting net sales and profitability, these and other challenges may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands, as well as long-lived assets (i.e. potentially resulting in impairments).
We believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable. We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth. We continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; increasing inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could negatively impact results within Europe, the Middle East & Africa due to pricing pressures on our retail customers and consumers in key international travel retail locations. Additionally, we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are also mindful of inflationary pressures on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences.
38 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. As the invasion of Ukraine continues and international sanctions evolve, our business and ability to operate in Russia and Ukraine continue to be negatively impacted. As we responsibly scale-down our operations, we expect to sell a limited selection of products to authorized retailers in Russia. We will continue to monitor the risks and evolving situation that may further affect our business and will adjust our plans accordingly. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Ukraine and Russia accounted for approximately 1% of consolidated net sales. There are uncertainties related to the future impacts on our business, including possible new sanctions that are difficult to predict due to the high level of geopolitical volatility. On a broader perspective, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings, assets and cash flows from such uncertainties. We also note that worsening conditions could exacerbate economic challenges in other countries such as inflationary pressures, energy shortages, recessions or other consequences. Please refer to
Risk Factors
in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, for a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business and industry. The uncertainty around the timing, speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on our business in China and the other macro challenges we are facing, will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably. We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of more ordinary challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength, discipline and agility, including continuing to execute upon and benefit from efficiencies attributable to previously approved initiatives under the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. As the current situation continues to progress, if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business. We are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business. Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program Information about our restructuring initiative, the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, is described in  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities
herein, as well as, in
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities  and in the  Overview  on page 33 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Other Intangible Asset Impairments During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our Smashbox reporting unit. We concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million reducing the carrying value to zero.
During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022. 39 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. We concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, we performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. We concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $100 million for Dr.Jart+ and $86 million for Too Faced. We concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, we concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted-average cost of capital, which was 11% and 13%, respectively. A summary of the impairment charges for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and the remaining trademark and goodwill carrying values as of December 31, 2022, for each reporting unit, are as follows: Impairment Charge Carrying Value (In millions) Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2022 Reporting Unit: Geographic Region Trademarks Goodwill Trademarks Goodwill Smashbox The Americas $ 21  $ —  $ —  $ —  Dr. Jart+ Asia/Pacific 100  —  339  318  Too Faced The Americas 86  —  186  13  Total $ 207  $ —  $ 525  $ 331  The impairment charges for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were reflected in the skin care product category for Dr.Jart+ and the makeup product category for Smashbox and Too Faced. The fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademarks were equal to their carrying values subsequent to the impairment charges taken as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units exceeded their carrying value by 7% and 10%, respectively. For the Dr.Jart+ and Too faced reporting units, if all other assumptions are held constant, a decrease of 10% in the estimated future cash flows, inclusive of the terminal value, or an increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average cost of capital, would have caused the carrying value of these reporting units to approximate their fair value. The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units and their respective trademarks are primarily predicated on the estimated future impacts of COVID-19, the success of future new product launches, the achievement of distribution expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not materialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which the reporting unit operates, resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, and their respective trademarks, and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future. 40 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NET SALES Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 As Reported: Net sales $ 4,620  $ 5,539  $ 8,550  $ 9,931  $ Change from prior-year period (919) (1,381) % Change from prior-year period (17) % (14) % Non-GAAP Financial Measure (1) : % Change from prior-year period in constant currency adjusting for returns associated with restructuring and other activities (11) % (9) % (1) See “ Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”  beginning on page 54 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Reported net sales decreased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, driven by lower net sales from the skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories and from all geographic regions. In both periods, the net sales decrease is primarily due to the COVID-related impacts, affecting Asia travel retail, mainland China, and the Dr.Jart+ travel retail business in Korea, as well as the impact of the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances effective June 30, 2022.
Skin care net sales declined for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by Estée Lauder, La Mer, Dr.Jart+ and Clinique, partially offset by higher net sales from The Ordinary and Bobbi Brown. Makeup net sales decreased in both periods due to lower net sales from Estée Lauder and Tom Ford Beauty, partially offset by an increase in net sales from M·A·C driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenue due to changes to the BACK 2 M·A·C take back program during the fiscal 2023 second quarter. Fragrance net sales declined in both periods primarily due to the impact of the license terminations related to the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines ("certain of our designer fragrances") effective June 30, 2022 and lower net sales from Jo Malone London, partially offset by higher net sales from Estée Lauder, Le Labo, Tom Ford Beauty and Clinique.
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa declined for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the COVID-related impacts affecting Asia travel retail, as well as lower net sales from Russia, and the United Kingdom, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Net sales decreased in Asia/Pacific in both periods, primarily due to the COVID-related impacts affecting Greater China and the Dr.Jart+ travel retail business in Korea, partially offset by higher net sales from southeast Asia, led by the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Net sales in The Americas decreased in both periods, driven by the impact of the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances effective June 30, 2022, and the impact in the United States from the tightening of inventory from certain of our retailers and lower replenishment orders in the fiscal 2023 second quarter. Partially offsetting the decrease in net sales in The Americas for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in net sales in Latin America. The total net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $282 million and $458 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. Accordingly, the following discussions of Net sales by
Product Categories
and
Geographic Regions
exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 of $1 million and $6 million, respectively, and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 of $1 million and $2 million, respectively. Reported net sales decreased 17% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the decrease from volume of 11%, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 5%, and the impact from the license terminations of certain of our designer fragrances of 1%. The impact from pricing was virtually flat period-over-period, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions offset by changes in mix.
41 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Reported net sales decreased 14% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the decrease from volume of 10%, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 5%, and the impact from the license terminations of certain of our designer fragrances of 1%. Partially offsetting these decreases was the increase from pricing of 2%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions, partially offset by changes in mix.
Product Categories Skin Care Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 As Reported: Net sales $ 2,382  $ 3,159  $ 4,486  $ 5,608  $ Change from prior-year period (777) (1,122) % Change from prior-year period (25) % (20) % Non-GAAP Financial Measure (1) : % Change from prior-year period in constant currency (20) % (16) % (1) See “ Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”  beginning on page 54 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Reported skin care net sales decreased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting lower net sales from Estée Lauder, La Mer, Clinique and Dr.Jart+, combined, of approximately $762 million and $1,068 million, respectively, primarily driven by the COVID-related impacts affecting Asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain of our retailers, retail traffic in mainland China and the Dr.Jart+ travel retail business in Korea. Also contributing to the decrease in net sales from Estée Lauder for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 in the United States was the tightening of inventory from certain of our retailers and lower replenishment orders in the fiscal 2023 second quarter.
Partially offsetting these decreases in skin care net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were higher net sales from The Ordinary and Bobbi Brown, combined, of approximately $34 million and $38 million, respectively. The increase in net sales from The Ordinary in both periods was driven by success of hero products, new product launches and expanded distribution. In both periods, the increase in net sales from Bobbi Brown reflected the continued success of hero products.
The skin care net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $152 million and $237 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Reported skin care net sales decreased 25% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the decrease from volume of 18%, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 5%, and a decrease from pricing of 2%, due to the unfavorable impact from changes in mix, partially offset from strategic pricing actions.
Reported skin care net sales decreased 20% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the decrease from volume of 16% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 4%. The impact from pricing was virtually flat period-over-period, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions offset by changes in mix.

Reported makeup net sales decreased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting lower net sales from Estée Lauder and Tom Ford Beauty, combined, of approximately $119 million and $233 million, respectively, primarily driven by COVID-related impacts, affecting Asia travel retail and retail traffic in mainland China. Partially offsetting these decreases in net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in net sales from M·A·C in both periods, driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenue due to changes to the BACK 2 M·A·C take back program during the fiscal 2023 second quarter. The makeup net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $73 million and $123 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Reported makeup net sales decreased 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the decrease from volume of 9% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 5%. Partially offsetting these decreases was the increase from pricing of 5% due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter-to-quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions. In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,725 million compared with $3,957 million at June 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs, currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA ” ) resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. As a result, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings, and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings. We do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years, however we are mindful of increasing inflationary pressures. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases. 59 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. In November 2022, we signed an agreement to acquire the TOM FORD brand. The amount to be paid for the acquisition is approximately $2,300 million, net of a $250 million payment to be received at closing from Marcolin S.p.A. and expects to close in the second half of fiscal 2023. We expect to fund this transaction through a combination of cash, debt and $300 million in deferred payments to the sellers that become due beginning in July 2025. In addition, the acquisition will result in the elimination of the existing license royalty payments on our beauty business upon closing. Credit Ratings Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility. Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. As of January 26, 2023, our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s. Debt At December 31, 2022, our outstanding borrowings were as follows: ($ in millions) Long-term Debt Current Debt Total Debt 3.125% Senior Notes, due December 1, 2049 (“2049 Senior Notes”)  (1), (12) $ 636  $ —  $ 636  4.15% Senior Notes, due March 15, 2047 (“2047 Senior Notes”)  (2), (12) 494  —  494  4.375% Senior Notes, due June 15, 2045 (“2045 Senior Notes”)  (3), (12) 455  —  455  3.70% Senior Notes, due August 15, 2042 (“2042 Senior Notes”)  (4), (12) 247  —  247  6.00% Senior Notes, due May 15, 2037 (“2037 Senior Notes”)  (5), (12) 295  —  295  5.75% Senior Notes, due October 15, 2033 (“2033 Senior Notes”)  (6) 197  —  197  1.950% Senior Notes, due March 15, 2031 ("2031 Senior Notes")

In January 2023, we entered into a $2,000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on January 2, 2024 (the “New Facility”) for liquidity support for our commercial paper program and general corporate purposes, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. Interest rates on borrowings under the New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. In January 2023, we increased our commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States from $2,500 million to $4,500 million. Cash Flows Six Months Ended December 31 (In millions) 2022 2021 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 751  $ 1,846  Net cash flows used for investing activities $ (285) $ (414) Net cash flows used for financing activities $ (685) $ (1,775) The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities primarily reflected lower earnings before tax, excluding non-cash items, and the unfavorable change in working capital, reflecting lower other accrued liabilities, which includes the settlement of net investment hedges, lower accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially offset by a favorable change in accounts receivable. The change in net cash flows used for investing activities primarily reflected a favorable impact from the settlement of net investment hedges, which is offset by the unfavorable change in other accrued liabilities as discussed above, and a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior-year period. The change in net cash flows used for financing activities primarily reflected a decrease relating to lower treasury stock repurchases compared to the prior-year period.

Credit Risk For a discussion of credit risk, see  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk) . 61 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Market Risk We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $267 million and $259 million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $33 million and $41 million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets - impairment assessment and income taxes. Since June 30, 2022, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our critical accounting policies, except as disclosed in
