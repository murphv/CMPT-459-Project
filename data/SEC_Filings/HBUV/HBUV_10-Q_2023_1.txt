carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values
and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2022, the
Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had an accumulated deficit of $ 1,748,640
and expects to incur further losses in the
development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and,
therefore, that it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes
profitable. Management intends to focus on raising additional funds either by way of debt or equity issuances in order to continue operations.
The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to obtain additional financing or generate revenues sufficient
to maintain operations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and regulations and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”)
and in the opinion of management contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Reclassification
Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no material impact
on net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
7
Fair
Value Measurements
The
fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable,
that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:
Level
1
quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2
observable
inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant
value drivers are observable; and
Level
3
assets
and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
fair value of the assets or liabilities.

CONTINGENCY/LEGAL
As
of September 30, 2022, and during the preceding ten years, no director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer, or
promoter of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder.
From
time to time, the Company may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business
activities. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted. Any adverse result in
these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to the Company’s business. The Company currently is not a party to any
claim or litigation, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

OTHER INCOME
The
company generated Other Income in the amount of $ 29,800
which is made up of money paid by Condon Realty
Group to the company for consulting services performed. Condon Realty Group represents Hubilu subsidiaries’ acquisitions during
this period.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

have evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through January 10, 2023, the date at which the financial statements were
issued, and determined that there were no items that require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

Forward
Looking Statements
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, the “Reform Act”). The Reform
Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves
so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors
that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements, other than statements of historical fact that we
make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,”
“intends,” “will continue,” “estimates,” “plans,” “projects,” the negative
of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does
not mean the statement is not forward-looking.
Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from the future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Certain risks, uncertainties or other important
factors are detailed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may be detailed from time to time in other reports we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including on Forms 8-K and 10-K.Examples of forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and to fund our working capital
and capital expenditure requirements. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions
regarding demand for our future products, the timing and cost of capital expenditures, competitive conditions and general economic conditions.
These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements include:
●
the
risks of a start-up company;
●
management’s
plans, objectives and budgets for its future operations and future economic performance;
●
capital
budget and future capital requirements;
●
meeting
future capital needs;
●
our
dependence on management and the need to recruit additional personnel;
●
limited
trading for our common stock, if listed or quoted
●
the
level of future expenditures;
●
impact
of recent accounting pronouncements;
●
the
outcome of regulatory and litigation matters; and
●
the
assumptions described in this report underlying such forward-looking statements. Actual results and developments may materially differ
from those expressed in or implied by such statements due to a number of factors, including:
●
those
described in the context of such forward-looking statements;
●
the
political, social and economic climate in which we conduct operations; and
●
the
risk factors described in other documents and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
We
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict
all of those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable.
However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to
update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.
