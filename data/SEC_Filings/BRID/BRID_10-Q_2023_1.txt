Summary of Significant Accounting Policies :
The
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Bridgford Foods Corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “our”,
“us”) for the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023 and January 21, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
8 of Regulation S-X, and include all adjustments considered necessary by management for a fair presentation of the interim periods. This
Report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2022 (the
“Annual Report”). Due to seasonality and other factors, interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for
the full year. Recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and their effect on the Company are discussed in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Report.
We
have considered the impact of federal, state, and local government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Consolidated Financial
Statements. The business disruptions associated with the pandemic had a minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the
fiscal year ended October 28, 2022 and during the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023. We expect these events to have future business
impacts, the extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the pandemic severity worsens. These impacts could include but
may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to shifts in demand between sales channels, market volatility, constraints in our
supply chain, our ability to operate production facilities and worker availability. These unknowns may subject the Company to future
risks related to long-lived asset impairments, increased reserves for uncollectible accounts, price and availability of ingredients and
raw materials used in our products and adjustments to reflect the market value of our inventory.
The
October 28, 2022, balance sheet amounts within these interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were derived from the audited
fiscal year 2022 financial statements included in the Annual Report.
The
preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Some of the estimates needed to be made by management include the allowance for doubtful
accounts, promotional and returns allowances, inventory reserves, the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and the
valuation allowance for the Company’s deferred tax assets. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Amounts
estimated related to liabilities for self-insured workers’ compensation, employee healthcare and pension benefits are especially
subject to inherent uncertainties and these estimated liabilities may ultimately settle at amounts which vary from our current estimates.
Market conditions and the volatility in stock markets may cause significant changes in the measurement of our pension fund liabilities
and the performance of our life insurance policies in future periods.
Financial
instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued payroll, and notes payable. The carrying amount of these instruments approximate fair market value due to their short-term maturity
or market interest rates. The Company has accounts with nationally recognized financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any significant credit risk with regard to its cash and cash equivalents. The Company grants payment terms to a significant number
of customers that are diversified over a wide geographic area. The Company monitors the payment histories of its customers and maintains
an allowance for doubtful accounts which is reviewed for adequacy on a quarterly basis. The Company does not require collateral from
its customers.
Comprehensive
income or loss
Comprehensive
income or loss consists of net income and additional minimum pension liability adjustments. There were no differences between net income
(loss) and comprehensive income (loss) during each of the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, or January 21, 2022.

Revenue
recognition
Revenues
are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 –
Revenue from Contracts with
Customers
upon passage of title to the customer, typically upon product pick-up, shipment, or delivery to customers. Products are
delivered to customers primarily through our own long-haul fleet, common carrier, or through a Company-owned direct store delivery system.
The
Company recognizes revenue for the sale of the product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control
of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment, pickup or delivery to a customer based on terms
of the sale. Contracts with customers are typically short-term in nature with completion of a single performance obligation. Product
is sold to foodservice, retail, institutional and other distribution channels. Shipping and handling that occurs after the customer has
obtained control of the product is recorded as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional performance obligation. Costs paid to third
party brokers to obtain contracts are recognized as part of selling expenses. Other sundry items in context of the contract are also
recognized as selling expense. Any taxes collected on behalf of the government are excluded from net revenue.
We
record revenue at the transaction price which is measured as the amount of consideration we anticipate receiving in exchange for providing
product to our customers. Revenue is recognized as the net amount estimated to be received after deducting estimated or known amounts
including variable consideration for discounts, trade allowances, consumer incentives, coupons, volume-based incentives, cooperative
advertising, product returns and other such programs. Promotional allowances, including customer incentive and trade promotion activities,
are recorded as a reduction to sales based on amounts estimated being due to customers, based primarily on historical utilization and
redemption rates. Estimates are reviewed regularly until incentives or product returns are realized and the result of any such adjustments
are known. Promotional allowances deducted from sales for the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, and January 21, 2022, were $ 3,864
and $ 3,503 , respectively.
Leases
Leases
are recognized in accordance with ASC 842 and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02 Leases (“ASC 842”)
which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities with lease terms of more than
twelve months . We lease or rent property for
such operations as storing inventory and equipment. We analyze our agreements to evaluate whether or not a lease exists by determining
what assets exist for which we control usage for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In the event a lease exists, we classify
it as a finance or operating lease and record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and the corresponding lease liability at the inception
of the lease. In the case of month-to-month lease or rental agreements with terms of twelve months or less, we made an accounting policy
election to not recognize lease assets and liabilities and record them on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The storage units
rented on a month-to-month basis for use by our Snack Food Product segment direct store delivery route system are not costly to relocate
and contain no significant leasehold improvements or degree of integration over leased assets. Orders can be fulfilled by another route
storage unit interchangeably. No specialized assets exist in the rental storage units. Market price is paid for storage units. No guarantee
of debt is made.
ROU
lease assets are recorded within property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company leases
warehouse space from time to time that is recorded as ROU lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities. The Company’s leases
of long-haul trucks used in its Frozen Food Products segment qualify as finance leases. Finance lease liabilities are recorded under
other liabilities, the consolidated balance sheets reflecting both the current and long-term obligation. The classification as a finance
or operating lease determines whether the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows are considered operating
or financing.
Subsequent
events
Management
has evaluated events subsequent to January 20, 2023, through the date that the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for transactions and other events which may require adjustments of and/or disclosure
in such financial statements.
On
February 27, 2023, the Company modified the lease with Hogshed Ventures, LLC by extending the lease a year after the lease expires
on June 30, 2023. The effective date of the lease modification occurred when both the lessee and the lessor approved such
modification. The lease modification terms are still being worked out.
8
of 25
Based
on Management’s review, no other material events were identified that require adjustment to the financial statements or additional
disclosure.
Basic
earnings per share
Basic
earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for all periods presented. No stock options,
warrants, or other potentially dilutive convertible securities were outstanding as of January 20, 2023, or January 21, 2022.

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Inventories
include the cost of raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down
any estimated excess, obsolete inventories or impaired balances to net realizable value. An inventory reserve is created when potentially
slow-moving or obsolete inventories are identified in order to reflect the appropriate inventory value. Changes in economic conditions,
production requirements, and lower than expected customer demand could result in additional obsolete or slow-moving inventory that cannot
be sold or must be sold at reduced prices and could result in additional reserve provisions. We maintain a net realizable reserve of
$ 137
as of January 20, 2023, and $ 131
as of October 28, 2022, on products in inventory after determining that the market value on some
meat products could not cover the costs associated with completion and sale of the product.
Note

Contingencies and Commitments :
The
Company generally leases warehouse and/or office facilities throughout the United States through month-to-month rental agreements. In
the case of month-to-month lease or rental agreements with terms of 12 months or less, the Company made an accounting policy election
to not recognize lease assets and liabilities and record them on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For further information regarding
our lease accounting policy, please refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Leases.
The
Company leases three long-haul trucks received during fiscal year 2019. The six-year leases for these trucks expire in 2025.
Amortization
of equipment as a finance lease was $ 20
during the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023. The Company leased one long-haul truck for $ 40
received during fiscal year 2021, and that lease term is
two years .
The
Company performed a detailed analysis and determined that the only indication of a long-term lease in addition to transportation leases
for long-haul trucks was the warehouse lease with Hogshed Ventures, LLC and Racine Partners 4333 LLC.
The
Company’s five-year term lease with Racine Partners 4333 LLC, was effective June 1, 2022. A right-of-use asset of $ 3,996
and corresponding
liability for warehouse storage space of $ 4,026
as of January 20, 2023 was recorded for Racine Partners 4333 LLC for 43 rd
Street in Chicago, Illinois. This lease does not provide an implicit rate and we estimated our incremental interest rate to be approximately
3.68 %. We used our estimated incremental borrowing rate and other information available at the lease commencement date in determining
the present value of the lease payments.
A
right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for warehouse storage space was recorded for $ 187
for Hogshed Ventures, LLC for 40th Street
in Chicago, Illinois, as of January 20, 2023.
We lease this space under a non-cancelable operating lease. This lease does not have significant
rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives or other build-out clauses. Further this lease does not contain
contingent rent provisions.
This lease was set to terminate on
June 30, 2023 , but was extended one year on March 1, 2023 and as a result
will terminate on June 30, 2024. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Subsequent events. This lease
includes both lease (e.g., fixed rent) and non-lease components (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, common-area, and other maintenance
costs). The non-lease components are deemed to be executory costs and are included in the minimum lease payments used to determine the
present value of the operating lease obligation and related right-of-use asset.
The
lease with Hogshed Ventures, LLC does not provide an implicit rate and we estimated our incremental interest rate to be approximately
1.6 %. We used our estimated incremental borrowing rate and other information available at the lease commencement date in determining
the present value of the lease payments.

The
Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
We
purchase large quantities of pork, beef, and flour. These ingredients are generally available from a number of different suppliers although
the availability of these ingredients is subject to seasonal variation. We build ingredient inventories to take advantage of downward
trends in seasonal prices or anticipated supply limitations.
We
purchase bulk flour under short-term fixed price contracts at current market prices. The contracts are usually effective for and settle
within three months or less. We monitor and manage our ingredient costs to help negate volatile daily swings in market prices when possible.
We do not participate in the commodity futures market or hedging to limit commodity exposure.

Segment Information :
The
Company has
two
reportable operating segments: Frozen Food Products (the processing and distribution of frozen food products) and Snack
Food Products (the processing and distribution of meat and other convenience foods).
We
evaluate each segment’s performance based on revenues and operating income. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenses include corporate accounting, information systems, human resource management and marketing, which are managed at the corporate
level. These activities are allocated to each operating segment based on revenues and/or actual usage. Assets managed at the corporate
level are not attributable to each operating segment and thus have been included as “other” in the accompanying segment information.

Income Taxes :
On
March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss (“NOL”) carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100%
of taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021.
In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in taxable years
beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate
a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company has filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2018 and 2019 (fiscal year 2019
and 2020) and carried back a taxable loss of $ 34,405
to tax years 2013 (fiscal 2014), 2014 (fiscal year 2015), 2015 (fiscal year 2016),
2016 (fiscal year 2017) and 2018 (fiscal year 2019).
On
December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. Among other significant changes, the Tax
Act reduced the corporate federal income tax rate from
35 % to
21 %. The carryback of NOLs from tax years 2018 and 2019 under the CARES
Act to pre-Tax Act years generated an income tax benefit due to the differential in income tax rates which was recorded in fiscal year
2020 .
The
Company’s effective tax rate was
29.9 % and
17.7 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax
rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflects the impact of $ 398
of tax expense.
As
of January 20, 2023, the Company has a federal NOL carry forward of approximately $ 0
and state NOL carry forwards of approximately $ 4,600
million.
Our
federal income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the fiscal years 2019 through 2021. We are subject
to income tax in Texas and various other state taxing jurisdictions. Our state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute
of limitations for the fiscal years 2018 through 2021.

Equipment Notes Payable and Financial Arrangements :
Revolving
Credit Facility
We
maintain a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that extends to
August 31, 2023 . As of year-end October 28, 2022, under
the terms of this line of credit, we could borrow up to $ 15,000
at an interest rate equal to the bank’s prime rate or secured overnight
financing rate (“SOFR”) plus
2.0 %. The line of credit has an unused commitment fee of
0.25 % of the available loan amount.
The line of credit is presented under non-current liabilities at October 28, 2022, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets. On December 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. expanded our line of credit to $ 25,000
through June 15, 2022, upon which time the
credit limit returned to $ 15,000
for the balance of the term. We borrowed $ 2,000
under this line of credit on December 2, 2020, $ 2,000
on April 27, 2021, $ 2,000
on July 1, 2021, $ 3,000
on July 19, 2021, $ 3,000
on October 15, 2021, $ 2,000
on November 1, 2021, $ 2,000
on
December 16, 2021, and $ 2,000
on January 24, 2022, for a combined total of $ 18,000 . The outstanding balance under the revolving line
of credit was paid off on June 7, 2022, using $ 18,000
in proceeds from the gain on the sale of a land parcel in Chicago.
Equipment
Notes Payable
On
December 26, 2018, we entered into a master collateral loan and security agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Original Wells
Fargo Loan Agreement”) for up to $ 15,000
in equipment financing which was amended and expanded as detailed below. We subsequently
entered into additional master collateral loan and security agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on each of; April 18, 2019, December
19, 2019, March 5, 2020, and April 17, 2020 (the Original Wells Fargo Loan Agreement and the subsequent agreements collectively referred
to as the “Wells Fargo Loan Agreements”). Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Loan Agreements, we owe the amounts as stated in the
table below on the following page.
Bridge
Loan
On
August 30, 2021, we entered into a loan commitment note for a bridge loan of up to $ 25,000
to obtain capital to pay off the existing
equipment loans as they come out of the lock out period and may be prepaid. The outstanding principal balances of the bridge loan became
due and payable in full one Federal Reserve business day after the closing of the real estate transactions contemplated under the Purchase
and Sale Agreement dated March 16, 2020, as amended, between Bridgford Food Processing Corporation and CRG Acquisition, LLC (the “CRG
Purchase Agreement”). We prepaid $ 18,653
in equipment loans utilizing proceeds from the new bridge loan. The Company evaluated
the exchange under ASC 470 and determined that the exchange should be treated as a debt modification prospectively. The Company accounted
for this transaction as a debt modification and did not incur any gain or loss relating to the modification. The debt modification did
not meet the greater than ten percent test and was deemed not substantial. We prepaid and terminated the bridge loan and related loan
commitment note on June 2, 2022, using $ 18,653
in proceeds from the gain on the sale of a land parcel in Chicago pursuant to the CRG
Purchase Agreement.

this Report, we have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “may,” “believe,”
“will,” “could,” “project,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“should,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecasts,” “goal,”
“seek,” “intend,” other forms of these words or similar words or expressions or the negative thereof (although
not all forward-looking statements contain these words).
Such
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance,
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our production facilities, supply chain, consumer demand, and cost of products sold, the impact of competitive products and pricing;
macroeconomic conditions, including global financial pressures, inflation, market volatility, and recessionary concerns; success of operating
initiatives; development and operating costs; advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; acceptance of new product offerings;
consumer trial and frequency; changes in business strategy or development plans; availability, terms and deployment of capital; availability
of qualified personnel; commodity, labor, and employee benefit costs; changes in, or failure to comply with, government regulations;
weather conditions; construction schedules; and other factors referenced in this Report as well as in our other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In addition, actual results may differ as a result of additional risks and uncertainties
of which we are currently unaware or which we do not currently view as material to our business. We have based our forward-looking statements
on our current expectations and projections about trends affecting our business and industry and other future events. Although we do
not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Assumptions
relating to budgeting, marketing, and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations
and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing,
capital expenditure or other budgets, which may in turn affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The reader is therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein and to consider other risks
detailed more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) as
well as our other filings with the SEC with the understanding that our future results may be materially different from what we currently
expect. The forward-looking statements we make speak only as of the date on which they are made. We expressly disclaim any intent or
obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof to conform such statements to actual results or to changes
in our opinions or expectations. If we do update or correct any forward-looking statements, readers should not conclude that we will
make additional updates or corrections.
COVID-19
We
are continuing to monitor and respond to the evolving nature of state and local government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and
its impact on each of our production plant locations and our customer base. We coordinate with our local managers for the primary purpose
of maintaining the health and safety of our team members, ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities, and maintaining
the liquidity of our business.
We
continue to experience minor challenges related to the pandemic. These challenges may continue to increase our operating costs and negatively
impact our sales volumes. The health and safety of our team members is our top priority. To protect our team members, as needed, we have
implemented safety measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
in our facilities and have implemented social distancing, temperature checks of team members, increased efforts to deep clean and sanitize
facilities, the use of protective face coverings in certain environments, and making protective face coverings and other protective equipment
available to team members. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 are unknown and dependent upon future developments including the duration
and spread of the pandemic, COVID-19 variants and resurgences as well as actions taken by federal, state and local government officials.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Management Estimates
The
preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during
the respective reporting periods. Some of the estimates needed to be made by management include the allowance for doubtful accounts,
promotional and returns allowances, inventory reserves, the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, and the valuation allowance
for the Company’s deferred tax assets. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. We determine the amounts to
record based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we view as reasonable under the circumstances and consider all
relevant available information. The results of this analysis form the basis for our conclusion as to the value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily available from other independent sources. Amounts estimated related to liabilities for self-insured workers’
compensation, employee healthcare and pension benefits are especially subject to inherent uncertainties and these estimated liabilities
may ultimately settle at amounts which vary from our current estimates.
Current
accounting principles require that our pension benefit obligation be measured using an internal rate of return (“IRR”) analysis
to be included in the discount rate selection process. The IRR calculation for the Retirement Plan for Employees of Bridgford Foods Corporation
is measured annually and based on the Citigroup Pension Discount Rate. The Citigroup Pension Discount Rate as of January 31, 2023, was
4.69% as compared to 5.51% as of October 28, 2022. The discount rate applied can significantly affect the value of the projected benefit
obligation as well as the net periodic benefit cost.
Our
credit risk is diversified across a broad range of customers and geographic regions. Losses due to credit risk have recently been immaterial.
The provision for doubtful accounts receivable is based on historical trends and current collection risk. We have significant receivables
with a couple of large, well-known customers which, although historically secure, could be subject to material risk should these customers’
operations suddenly deteriorate. We monitor these customers closely to minimize the risk of loss.
Customer
Concentration > 20% of AR or >10% of Sales
The
table below shows customers that accounted for more than 20% of consolidated accounts receivable (“AR”) or 10% of consolidated
sales for the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, and January 21, 2022, respectively.

Walmart AR represented
a higher percentage of consolidated AR as of January 20, 2023, due to terminating the accelerated payments on outstanding accounts

Revenues
are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 –
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
upon passage of title to the customer,
typically upon product pick-up, shipment, or delivery to customers. Products are delivered to customers primarily through our own long-haul
fleet or through a Company owned direct store delivery system.
We
record the cash surrender or contract value for life insurance policies as an adjustment of premiums paid in determining the expense
or income to be recognized under the contract for the period.
We
provide tax reserves for federal, state, local and international exposures relating to audit results, tax planning initiatives and compliance
responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes, and timing, and is a subjective
estimate. Although the outcome of these tax audits is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have
been made for potential liabilities, if any, resulting from these reviews. Actual outcomes may differ materially from these estimates.
We
assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets on a quarterly basis or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business
climate indicate that expected undiscounted future cash flows related to such long-lived assets may not be sufficient to support the
net book value of such assets. If undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the recorded assets, we recognize an impairment
to reduce the carrying value of the applicable long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.
We
participate in “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions on behalf of their employees. We pay monthly contributions
to union trust funds, a portion of which is used to fund pension benefit obligations to plan participants. The contribution amount may
change depending upon the ability of participating companies to fund these pension liabilities as well as the actual and expected returns
on pension plan assets. Should we withdraw from the union and cease participation in a union plan, federal law could impose a penalty
for additional contributions to the plan. The penalty would be recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The
ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability is dependent upon several factors including the funded status of the plan and contributions
made by other participating companies.

of 25
We
are subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,
the “PPACA”). Requirements of the law include the removal of the lifetime limits on active and retiree medical coverage,
expanding dependent coverage to age 26 and the elimination of pre-existing conditions that may impact other postretirement benefits costs.
The PPACA law also includes a potential excise tax on the value of benefits that exceed a pre-defined limit. Fortunately, this potential
tax has been indefinitely deferred and we do not see significant financial exposure. Finally, the PPACA includes provisions that require
employers to offer health benefits to all full-time employees (defined as 30 hours per week). The health coverage must meet minimum standards
for the actuarial value of the benefits offered and employee affordability. We believe that the current administration seems more likely
to enhance the scope and coverage associated with PPACA than to repeal or significantly change this law. The recent legislative packages
related to pandemic relief included some minor provisions that will impact health benefits in the future. These changes most prominently
focus on the impact of surprise balance bills from out-of-network providers. Our heath care plans as they exist in 2023 are complaint
with all applicable regulations that exist currently. As we look to the future, we anticipate that future legislative action will impact
the plans offered to active and retired participants. As we have done in the past, our executive team will continue to assess the accounting
implications of the PPACA and potential future legislation to determine the impact on our financial position and results of operations.
The potential future effects and cost of complying with the legislative changes is not determinable currently.
Overview
of Reporting Segments
We
operate in two business segments – the processing and distribution of frozen food products (the Frozen Food Products segment),
and the processing and distribution of snack food products (the Snack Food Products segment). For information regarding the separate
financial performance of the business segments refer to Note 4 — Segment Information of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this Report. We manufacture and distribute an extensive line of food products, including biscuits, bread
dough items, roll dough items, dry sausage products and beef jerky.
Frozen
Food Products Segment
Our
Frozen Food Products segment primarily manufactures and distributes biscuits, bread dough items, roll dough items and shelf stable sandwiches.
All items within this segment are considered similar products and have been aggregated at this level. Our frozen food business covers
the United States. Products produced by the Frozen Food Products segment are generally supplied to food service and retail distributors
who take title to the product upon shipment receipt through Company-leased long-haul vehicles. We leverage relationships with regional
sales managers, and we maintain a network of independent food service and retail brokers covering most of the United States. Brokers
are compensated on a commission basis. We believe that our broker relationships, in close cooperation with our regional sales managers,
are a valuable asset providing significant new product and customer opportunities. Regional sales managers perform several significant
functions for us, including identifying and developing new business opportunities and providing customer service and support to our distributors
and end purchasers through the effective use of our broker network.
Snack
Food Products Segment
Our
Snack Food Products segment primarily distributes products manufactured by us. All items within this segment are considered similar products
and have been aggregated at this level. The dry sausage division includes products such as jerky, meat snacks, sausage, and pepperoni
products. Our Snack Food Products segment sells approximately 170 different items through a direct store delivery network and customer-owned
distribution centers serving approximately 19,000 supermarkets, mass merchandise and convenience retail stores located in 49 states.
These customers are comprised of large retail chains and smaller “independent” operators.
Products
produced or distributed by the Snack Food Products segment are supplied to customers through either direct-store-delivery or direct delivery
to customer warehouses. Product delivered using the Company-owned fleet direct to the store is considered a direct-store-delivery. In
this case, we provide the service of setting up and maintaining the display and stocking our products. Products delivered to customer
warehouses are distributed to the retail store and stocked by the customer where it is then resold to the end consumer.

The
increase in net sales for the twelve-week period ended January 20, 2023, primarily relates to higher unit sales volume in pounds and
to a lesser extent higher selling prices per pound implemented during July 2021 and May 2022. Other institutional Frozen Food Products
dollar sales, including sheet dough and rolls, increased 20% and retail dollar sales volume increased by 10%. Returns activity increased
compared to the same twelve-week period in the 2022 fiscal year. Promotional activity was higher as a percentage of sales.

Net
sales in the Snack Food Products segment decreased by $4,497 (8.7%) to $47,223 in the first twelve-week period of the 2023 fiscal year
compared to the same twelve-week period in fiscal year 2022. The changes in net sales were comprised as follows:

Net
sales of Snack Food Products decreased due to lower unit sales volume in pounds through our direct store delivery distribution
channel and was partially offset by higher selling prices per pound during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We believe demand
decreased primarily due to inflationary pressures on consumer spending habits. The weighted average selling price per pound
increased compared to the same twelve-week period in the prior fiscal year due to changes in product mix. Returns activity was higher compared to the same twelve-week period in the 2022 fiscal year. Promotional offers
remained the same as a percentage of sales.
Cost

Cost
of products sold decreased by $3,137 (6.6%) to $44,556 in the first twelve-week period of the 2023 fiscal year compared to the same twelve-week
period in fiscal year 2022. The gross margin increased from 25.6% to 28.0% during the first twelve-weeks of fiscal year 2023.

Cost

Cost
of products sold in the Frozen Food Products segment increased by $1,893 (21.4%) to $10,744 in the first twelve-week period of the 2023
fiscal year compared to the same twelve-week period in fiscal year 2022. The cost of purchased flour increased approximately $139 in
the first twelve-week period of fiscal year 2023 compared to the same twelve-week period in fiscal year 2022. Increased unit sales volume
in pounds and gross overhead including hourly wages and benefits has increased as a result of continued upward pressures on wages as
a result of inflation. In our Frozen Food Products segment, the volume increases in foodservice were not enough to mitigate an increase
in overhead per case of product.
Cost
of Products Sold-Snack Food Products Segment
Cost
of products sold in the Snack Food Products segment decreased by $5,030 (12.9%) to $33,812 in the first twelve-week period of the 2023
fiscal year compared to the same twelve-week period in fiscal year 2022 due to lower cost for production materials and lower sales volume
in our direct store delivery distribution channel. The cost of significant meat commodities decreased approximately $4,306 in the first
twelve-week period of fiscal year 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2022. We increased our net realizable value reserve
of $5 during the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, to recognize inventory sold through on products already reserved in inventory as
of year-end October 28, 2022. We maintain a net realizable reserve of $137 on products as of January 20, 2023, after determining that
the market value on some meat products could not cover the costs associated with completion and sale of the product.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses-Consolidated
Selling,
general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased by $1,063 (7.2%) to $15,794 in the first twelve-week period of fiscal
year 2023 compared to the same twelve-week period in the prior fiscal year. The table below summarizes the significant expense increases

The
increase in the provision for bad debt expense was mainly the result of estimated losses on older balances. Outside storage increased
primarily as a result of the need for additional warehouse capacity to store product. Higher sales commissions resulted in higher wages
and bonus expenses in the first twelve weeks of the 2023 fiscal year compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in pension
expense was a result of an increase in pension plan assets caused by performance of the underlying markets that support them as well
as higher pension discount rates resulting in lower liabilities. None of the changes individually or as a group of expenses in “Other
SG&A” were significant enough to merit separate disclosure. The major components comprising the increase of “Other SG&A”
expenses were higher product advertising, workers’ compensation cost, healthcare expense and insurance expense.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses-Frozen Food Products Segment
SG&A
expenses in the Frozen Food Products segment increased by $558 (18.1%) to $3,644 in the first twelve-week period of fiscal year 2023
compared to the same twelve-week period in the prior fiscal year. The overall increase in SG&A expenses was due to higher wages and
bonuses, provision for bad debt and product advertising.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses-Snack Food Products Segment
SG&A
expenses in the Snack Food Products segment increased by $505 (4.3%) to $12,150 in the first twelve-week period of fiscal year 2023 compared
to the same twelve-week period in the prior fiscal year. Most of the increase was due to higher wages and bonuses, provision for bad
debt, workers’ compensation and product advertising, partially offset by decreased fees paid under brand licensing agreements.

Income
Taxes-Consolidated
Income
tax for the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, and January 21, 2022, respectively, was as follows:

January 21, 2022
Provision for income taxes
$ 398
$ 66
Effective tax rate
29.9 %
17.7 %
We
recorded a provision for income taxes of $398 for the twelve-week period ended January 20, 2023, related to federal and state taxes,
based on the Company’s expected annual effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate differed from the applicable mixed statutory
rate of approximately 26.4% due to non-deductible meals and entertainment, non-taxable gains and losses on life insurance policies, and
state income taxes.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
principal source of our operating cash flow is cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture, store, market
and deliver such products. We normally fund our operations from cash balances and cash flow generated from operations. We received approximately
$60,000 in gross proceeds on June 1, 2022, from the closing of the sale of real property located at 170 N. Green Street in Chicago pursuant
to the terms of the CRG Purchase Agreement. We borrowed $2,000 under our revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on December
2, 2020, $2,000 on April 27, 2021, $2,000 on July 1, 2021, $3,000 on July 19, 2021, $3,000 on October 15, 2021, $2,000 on November 1,
2021, $2,000 on December 16, 2021, and $2,000 on January 24, 2022, for a combined total of $18,000. The line of credit was paid off on
June 7, 2022, using $18,000 in proceeds from the sale of real property at 170 N. Green Street. The revolving line of credit continues
in effect per its terms to August 31, 2023. We entered into a bridge loan with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on August 30, 2021, for up to $25,000,
of which we used $18,653 to pay off a portion of our existing equipment loans as they came out of the lock out period and could be prepaid.
We prepaid and terminated the bridge loan on June 2, 2022, using $18,653 in proceeds from the sale of real property at 170 N. Green Street.
As of January 20, 2023, we had $1,099 of current debt on equipment loans, $67,004 of net working capital and $15,000 available under
our revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 6 – Equipment Notes Payable and Financial Arrangements of
the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this Report for further information.
Despite
higher commodity costs, we may not be able to increase our product prices in a timely manner or sufficiently to offset increased commodity
costs due to consumer price sensitivity, pricing in relation to competitors and the reluctance of retailers to accept the price increase.
Higher product prices could potentially lower demand for our product and decrease volume. Management believes there are various options
available to generate additional liquidity to repay debt or fund operations such as mortgaging real estate, should that be necessary.
Our ability to increase liquidity will depend upon, among other things, our business plans, the performance of operating divisions and
economic conditions of capital markets, or circumstances related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. If we are unable to increase liquidity
through mortgaging real estate, or generate positive cash flow necessary to fund operations, we may not be able to compete successfully,
which could negatively impact our business, operations, and financial condition. Combined with the cash expected to be generated from
the Company’s operations and income tax refunds due of $5,799, of which $5,117 in income tax refunds were received on July 19,
2022, we anticipate that we will maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business for at least the next twelve months. We will continue
to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity and, if necessary, take action to preserve liquidity and ensure that our business
can operate during these uncertain times.

For
the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $2,627, $1,290 more cash used than during the same
period in fiscal year 2022. The increase in net cash used by operating activities primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable
of $4,563, decrease in other current liabilities of $1,376 partially offset by net income of $932 and a decrease in inventory of $1,713.
During the twelve-week period ended January 20, 2023, we did not contribute towards our defined benefit pension plan. Plan funding strategies
may be adjusted depending upon economic conditions, investment options, tax deductibility, or recent legislative changes in funding requirements.
Our
cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables less days of trade payables outstanding) was equal to 78 days
for the twelve-week period ended January 20, 2023. The cash conversion cycle was 72 days for the twelve-week period ended January 21,
2022. The decrease in the cash conversion cycle was mainly due to lower days payable in accounts payable and to a lesser extent increased
average days in inventory. We have discontinued accelerating payments on outstanding accounts receivable from Walmart as of July 1, 2022.
For
the twelve weeks ended January 21, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $1,337 and primarily relates to an increase in accounts
receivable of $3,226, an increase in inventories of $2,462 and an increase in non-current liabilities of $1,064 partially offset by an
increase in accounts payable of $1,722. During the twelve-week period ended January 21, 2022, we did not contribute towards our defined
benefit pension plan.

program, we are authorized, at the discretion of management and our Board of Directors, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares
of our common stock on the open market. As of January 20, 2023, 120,113 shares remained authorized for repurchase under the program.
Revolving
Credit Facility
We
maintain a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that extends through August 31, 2023. As of year-end October 28, 2022,
under the terms of this line of credit, we could borrow up to $15,000 at an interest rate equal to the bank’s prime rate or secured
overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). The line of credit has an unused commitment fee of 0.25% of the available loan amount.
The line of credit is presented under non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. On December 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. expanded our line of credit to $25,000 through June 15, 2022, at which time the credit limit returned to $15,000 for the balance
of the term. We borrowed $2,000 under this line of credit on December 2, 2020, $2,000 on April 27, 2021, $2,000 on July 1, 2021, $3,000
on July 19, 2021, $3,000 on October 15, 2021, $2,000 on November 1, 2021, and $2,000 on December 26, 2021, and $2,000 on January 24,
2022, for a combined total of $18,000. The outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was paid
off on June 7, 2022, using $18,000 in proceeds from the sale of a land parcel in Chicago.
Equipment
Notes Payable
On
December 26, 2018, we entered into a master collateral loan and security agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Original Wells
Fargo Loan Agreement”) for up to $15,000 in equipment financing which was amended and expanded as detailed below. We subsequently
entered into additional master collateral loan and security agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on each of; April 18, 2019, December
19, 2019, March 5, 2020, and April 17, 2020 (the Original Wells Fargo Loan Agreement and the subsequent agreements collectively referred
to as the “Wells Fargo Loan Agreements”). Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Loan Agreements, we owe the amounts as stated in the
table below.
Bridge
Loan
On
August 30, 2021, we entered into a loan commitment note for a bridge loan of up to $25,000 to obtain capital to pay off the existing
equipment loans as they come out of the lock out period and may be prepaid. The outstanding principal balances of the bridge loan became
due and payable in full one Federal Reserve business day after the closing of the real estate transactions contemplated under the CRG
Purchase Agreement. We prepaid $18,653 in equipment loans utilizing proceeds from the new bridge loan. The Company evaluated the exchange
under ASC 470 and determined that the exchange should be treated as a debt modification prospectively. The Company accounted for this
transaction as a debt modification and did not incur any gain or loss relating to the modification. The debt modification did not meet
the greater than ten percent test and was deemed not substantial. We prepaid and terminated the bridge loan and related loan commitment
note on June 2, 2022, using $18,653 in proceeds from the sale of a land parcel in Chicago pursuant to the CRG Purchase Agreement.
The
following table reflects major components of our revolving line of credit and borrowing agreements as of January 20, 2023, and October
28, 2022, respectively.

Loan
Covenants
The
Wells Fargo Loan Agreements collectively contain various affirmative and negative covenants that limit the use of funds and define other
provisions of the loan. Material covenants are listed below:
●
Total Liabilities divided by Tangible Net Worth not
greater than 2.5 to 1.0 at each fiscal quarter,
●
Quick Ratio not less than 0.85 to 1.0 at each fiscal
quarter end,
●
Net Income After Taxes not less than $500 on a quarterly
basis, and
●
Capital Expenditures less than $5,000.
As
of January 20, 2023 and October 28, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Wells Fargo Loan Agreements.
All
of our operating segments have been impacted by inflation, including higher costs for labor, freight, and specific materials. We expect
this trend to continue through the remainder of fiscal year 2023. Management is of the opinion that the Company’s financial position
and its capital resources are sufficient to provide for its operating needs and capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year
2023. However, future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect
our financial results.
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements and regulations
There
were no new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB during the first twelve weeks of fiscal year 2023, and through the
date of filing this report which the Company believes will have a material impact on its financial statements.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
are not engaged in any “off-balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not
required for smaller reporting companies.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management, with the participation and under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this Report. As of January 20, 2023, based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by
this Report due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company’s failure to timely
report to accounting a change in lease terms from a month-to month lease to a five-year term lease, as disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2022. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control
over financial reporting and believes the issue has been remediated as of the date of this Report.
Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The
design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

We
maintain and evaluate a system of internal accounting controls, and a program of internal auditing designed to provide reasonable assurance
that our assets are protected and that transactions are performed in accordance with proper authorization and are properly recorded.
This system of internal accounting controls is continually reviewed and modified in response to evolving business conditions and operations
and to recommendations made by the independent registered public accounting firm. On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) published Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (the “2013 Framework”) and related
illustrative documents as an update to Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) (the “1992 Framework”). The Company has
adopted the 2013 Framework this fiscal year and has determined that the 17 principles are present and functioning during our assessment
of the effectiveness of internal controls. We have established a code of conduct. Our management believes that the accounting and internal
control systems provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, and financial information is reliable.
The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with our financial management and counsel, and with the independent registered
public accounting firm engaged by us. Internal accounting controls and the quality of financial reporting are discussed during these
meetings. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by
the auditing standards adopted or established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee and
the independent registered public accounting firm have discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence
from the Company and its management, including the matters in the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board Rule 3526 “Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence”.
Remediation
We
began implementing a remediation plan to address the previously reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting,
described in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October
28, 2022. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting, including modifying
the design of the related internal controls to include verbal communication with plant managers on a quarterly basis, and expanding notification
to Operating Committee members for feedback on any additional information on new contractual arrangements for revenue, leases or other
types of agreements impacting accounting. In the case of the lease misstatement, we believe the failure to notify management was a one-time
oversight and not indicative of a pattern or continuing weakness in the proper functioning of the controls.
The
material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management
has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness
will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2023. Notwithstanding the material weakness, we believe the financial statements in
this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting other than those discussed above that occurred during the fiscal
quarter ended January 20, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
financial reporting.
Part
II. Other Information
Item
1A. Risk Factors
The
risk factors listed in Part I “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Annual Report should be considered with the information provided
elsewhere in this Report, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Except
as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Annual Report.
We
have considered the impact of federal, state, and local government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements. These business disruptions, in addition to any impacts already experienced, have not had a significant impact on
our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the twelve weeks ended January 20, 2023. There may be a future business impact, the
extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the severity worsens or what restrictions are implemented by the government.
These
impacts could include but may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to shifts in demand between sales channels, market volatility,
constraints in our supply chain, our ability to operate production facilities and worker availability. These unknowns may subject the
company to future risks related to long-lived asset impairments, increased reserves for uncollectible accounts, the price and availability
of ingredients and raw materials used in our products and adjustments to reflect the market value of our inventory.
