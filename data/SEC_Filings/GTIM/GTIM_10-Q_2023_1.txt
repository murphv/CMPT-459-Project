GOOD TIMES RESTAURANTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(Tabular dollar amounts in thousands, except
share and per share data)
Note 1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Good Times Restaurants Inc. (the “Company”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
as well as six partnerships in which the Company is the controlling partner. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company operates, and licenses full-service
restaurants under the brand
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
that are primarily located in Colorado and in the Southeast region of
the United States.
The Company operates and franchises drive-thru
fast food hamburger restaurants under the brand
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard , all of which are located in Colorado and
Wyoming.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices of the United States
of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements contain all of the normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of
the Company as of December 27, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal quarters ended December 27, 2022
and December 28, 2021. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending September 26, 2023. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 27, 2022 is derived
from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. As a
result, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 27, 2022.
Fiscal Year
– The Company’s
fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company’s quarterly
periods consist of 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter consist of
14 weeks. The quarters ended December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021 each consisted of 13 weeks.
Reclassification
– Certain prior
year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the
net income (loss).
Advertising Costs
– We utilize Advertising
Funds to administer certain advertising programs for both the Bad Daddy’s and Good Times brands that benefit both us and our franchisees.
We and our franchisees are required to contribute a percentage of gross sales to the fund.  The contributions to these funds are
designated and segregated for advertising. We consolidate the Advertising Funds into our financial statements whereby contributions from
franchisees, when received, are recorded and included as a component of franchise revenues.  As we intend to utilize all of the advertising
contributions towards advertising expenditures, we recognize costs equal to franchisee contributions to the advertising funds on a quarterly
basis. Contributions to the Advertising Funds from our franchisees were $ 66,000
and $ 67,000
for the quarters ended December 27, 2022 and
December 28, 2021, respectively.
Receivables
– Our receivables typically
consist of royalties and other fees due to us from independent franchisees of our brands as well as product rebates and other incentives
due to us under agreements with our food and beverage vendors, and payments due to us for sales of gift cards to third party retailers.
For the quarter ended December 27, 2022, total receivables were $1,119,000, which consists of $208,000
in receivables from large box retail partners, retailed receivables, $288,000 in rebate receivables, $319,000 in third party delivery
receivables, and $304,000 of franchise and other
receivables, compared to $2,350,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2021, consisting primarily of $619,000 in receivables from
large box retailers, $249,000 in rebate receivables, $243,000 in third party delivery receivables, $745,000 for a lease termination agreement
entered in the quarter for one of our Good Times locations, - and $494,000 of franchise and other receivables.
Macro-Economic Factors and Operating Environment
The global crisis resulting from the spread of
coronavirus (“COVID-19”) continued to our restaurant operations for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 although the impact
was more modest than in the prior year. We expect local conditions to continue to dictate limitations on restaurant operations, capacity,
and hours of operation. The lingering impacts of the pandemic have also contributed to labor challenges, which have increased hourly wages
and management salaries at both concepts, and in limited cases have resulted in reduced operating hours at certain restaurants. Supply
chain constraints have affected both of our concepts, resulting in higher food and beverage cost associated with general increases in
input price levels as well as increased product substitutions, elevated freight costs, and increased variability in product quality, primarily
in produce items. In addition, during the quarter ended December 27, 2022, high rates of inflation have been seen globally which have
also resulted in increases in commodity, labor and energy costs for both concepts. Further significant increases in inflation could affect
the global and U.S. economies, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations if we and our franchisees
are not able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.

Table of Contents
Although we conduct all of our restaurant operations
within the USA, worldwide product supply chains have been impacted by the war in Ukraine. Specifically sunflower oil and wheat, which
are fungible commodities, are used as ingredients in our raw materials and purchased by our suppliers, have significant supplies that
typically originate in Ukraine. The lack of availability of supplies of such products may impact the availability and supplier pricing
for products purchased by us for use in our business, which could result in higher food and packaging costs or reduced revenues.
Note 2.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company reviewed all recently issued accounting
pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.
Revenue
Revenue Recognition
Revenues consist primarily of sales from restaurant
operations; franchise revenue, which includes franchisee contributions to advertising funds. Revenues associated with gift card breakage
are immaterial to our financials. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over
a product or service to a customer, typically a restaurant customer or a franchisee/licensee.
The Company recognizes revenues in the form of
restaurant sales at the time of the sale when payment is made by the customer, as the Company has completed its performance obligation,
namely the provision of food and beverage, and the accompanying customer service, during the customer’s visit to the restaurant.
The Company sells gift cards to customers and recognizes revenue from gift cards primarily in the form of restaurant revenue. Gift Card
breakage, which is recognized when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed is remote, is determined based upon the Company’s
historic redemption patterns, and is immaterial to our overall financial statements.
Revenues we receive from our franchise and license
agreements include sales-based royalties, and from our franchise agreements also may include advertising fund contributions, area development
fees, and franchisee fees. We recognize sales-based royalties from franchisees and licensees as the underlying sales occur. We similarly
recognize advertising fund contributions from franchisees as the underlying sales occur. The Company also provides its franchisees with
services associated with opening new restaurants and operating them under franchise and development agreements in exchange for area development
and franchise fees. The Company would capitalize these fees upon receipt from the franchisee and then would amortize those over the contracted
franchise term as the services comprising the performance obligations are satisfied. We have not received material development or franchise
fees in the years presented, and the primary performance obligations under existing franchise and development agreements have been satisfied
prior to the earliest period presented in our financial statements.

Note 5.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has traditionally maintained incentive
compensation plans that include provision for the issuance of equity-based awards. The Company established the 2008 Omnibus Equity Incentive
Compensation Plan in 2008 (the “2008 Plan”) and has outstanding awards that were issued under the 2008 Plan. Subsequently,
the 2008 Plan expired in 2018 and the Company established a new plan, the 2018 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”)
during the 2018 fiscal year, which was approved by shareholders on May 24,
2018. Future awards will be issued under the 2018 Plan. On February 8, 2022 the Company’s
shareholders approved a proposal to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan from
900,000
to
1,050,000 ,
which currently represents the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant
date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the
vesting period of the grant). The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as forfeitures occur.
Our net income for the quarters ended December
27, 2022 and December 28, 2021 includes $ 46,000
and $ 95,000 , respectively, of compensation costs related to our stock-based compensation
arrangements.
Stock Option awards
The Company measures the compensation cost associated
with stock option awards by estimating the fair value of the award as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company
believes that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the
fair values of the Company’s stock options and stock awards granted during the quarter ended December 27, 2022. Estimates of fair
value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive equity awards.
There were
20,000
incentive stock options
awarded during the quarter ended December 27, 2022 to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer from available shares under the 2018
Plan, with an exercise price of $ 3.00
per share and a per share weighted average fair value of $ 2.29 . During the quarter ended December
28, 2021, the Company granted
90,000
incentive stock options to its Chief Executive Officer, from available shares under the 2018 Plan,
with an exercise price of $ 2.33
per share and a per share weighted average fair value of $ 1.24
pursuant to the Chief Executive Officer’s
Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated December 24, 2020.
In addition to the exercise and grant

based on the United States treasury yields in effect at the time of grant corresponding with the expected term of the options. The expected
option term is the number of years we estimate that options will be outstanding prior to exercise considering vesting schedules and our
historical exercise patterns.

Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt
Cadence Credit Facility
The Company maintains
a credit agreement with
Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to $ 8,000,000 , which as of December 27, 2022 had a maturity
date of January 31, 2023
(the “Cadence Credit Facility”). The Cadence Credit
Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of
0.25 %.
As of December 27, 2022, any borrowings
under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus
the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence bank publicly announced prime rate, and (c)
LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250% floor, plus 3.5%.
Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company selects
to pay interest based on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR. The Cadence Credit
Facility includes provisions for the Administrative Agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark
rate, which may be (but is not required to be) SOFR, at such point in time when appliable LIBOR rates are no longer available or no longer
reliable. The exact timing of any transition of LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate is not currently known.
During the fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2022,
the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility was
7.8 %.
The Cadence Credit Facility
contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this
type, including covenants setting a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1,
a minimum post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of $2.0 million. As of December 27, 2022, the
Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility.
As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit
Facility and the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately $ 308,500
and
is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement. The remaining amount to be amortized as of December 27, 2022 is $ 13,000 .
The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on
substantially all of the Company’s assets.
As
of the date of filing this Form
10-Q, there were no outstanding borrowings against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings
is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of filing this Form 10-Q, there were no outstanding
letters of credit issued under the facility.
On January 24, 2023, subsequent to the
end of the fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2022, the Company and Cadence amended the Cadence Credit Facility to extend its
expiration date to April 30, 2023, to provide consent for the Company’s acquisition of certain
non-controlling interests in Bad Daddy’s limited liability company partnerships, and to provide pro-forma credit
for a portion of the full-year EBITDA, as that term is defined in the Cadence Credit Facility previously attributed to the non-controlling
partners in those limited liability company partnerships. The Company is currently reviewing its future credit facility needs and
expects to negotiate an amendment to the existing credit agreement or enter into a new credit agreement prior to the current maturity
date of April 30, 2023.
Note 10.
Net Income per Common Share
Our basic earnings per
share calculation is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Our diluted earnings per share calculation
is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have
been outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive securities for this calculation consist
of in-the-money outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants (which were assumed to have been exercised at the average
market price of the common shares during the reporting period). The treasury stock method is used to measure the dilutive impact of in-the-money
stock options.

Contingent Liabilities and Liquidity
There may be various claims in process,
matters in litigation, and other contingencies brought against the company by employees, vendors, customers, franchisees, or other
parties. Evaluating these contingencies is a complex process that may involve substantial judgment on the potential outcome of such
matters, and the ultimate outcome of such contingencies may differ from our current analysis. We regularly review the adequacy of
accruals and disclosures related to such contingent liabilities in consultation with legal counsel. While it is not possible to
predict the outcome of these claims with certainty, subject to our disclosure immediately below, it is management’s opinion
that any reasonably possible losses associated with such contingencies would be immaterial to our financial statements.
The Company is the defendant in a lawsuit styled
as White Winston Select Asset Funds, LLC and GT Acquisition Group, Inc. v. Good Times Restaurants, Inc., arising from the failed negotiations
between plaintiffs and the Company for the sale of the Good Times Drive Thru subsidiary to plaintiffs. The lawsuit was initially filed
on September 24, 2019 in Delaware Chancery Court, and Company removed the case to federal court in the US District Court for the District
of Delaware on November 5, 2019. On July 30, 2021, the plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to amend their complaint and add new causes
of action and a claim for $ 18
million in damages. On April 11, 2022, the Court heard the parties’ respective motions for summary
judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court verbally ruled that it was dismissing all of the plaintiffs’ claims except for
their claim for breach of an express and implied obligation to negotiate in good faith under the parties’ letter of intent. On May
5, 2022, the Court issued a written order confirming this ruling. On May 25, 2022, the Court issued an order that the plaintiffs are only
entitled to reliance damages should they prevail on their claim for breaches of the express and implied obligations to negotiate in good
faith. The parties conducted a bench trial on the plaintiffs’ claims. The parties concluded post-trial briefing on October 24, 2022.
On January 25, 2023, the Court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety and denying all of the requested
relief. The plaintiffs’ deadlines for a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, an appeal are February 22 and February 25,
2023, respectively.
The Company previously recorded an accrual for
contingent litigation expense in the quarter ended March 28, 2022 in the amount of $ 332,000 . This amount represented the Company’s
best estimate of the likely amount of plaintiffs’ damage recovery assuming a finding of liability in their favor at trial. While
the Company was successful at trial, in light of plaintiff’s continuing right to seek a new trial or appeal at this time, the Company
has determined to maintain the accrual and will continue to evaluate this matter based on new information as it becomes available. The
ultimate resolution of the case (including any new trial or appeal if granted) could result in losses less than or in excess of amounts
accrued. Any additional liability in excess of the accrual could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which any such additional liability is accrued. The Company will
continue to vigorously pursue a full defense of this matter on the merits, including any new trial or appeal if granted.
Note 12.
Leases
The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company's material long-term operating lease agreements are for the land and buildings for our restaurants as well as our corporate office. The initial lease terms range from
10
years to
20
years, most of which include renewal options of
10
to
15
years. The lease term is generally the minimum of the noncancelable period or the lease term including renewal options which are reasonably certain of being exercised up to a term of approximately
20
years. The Company reassesses the number of remaining renewal options to include in a lease term for a specific lease
when it exercises an option to extend such lease.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized
at the lease commencement date for material leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Operating lease liabilities represent the present
value of future minimum lease payments. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, our operating lease liabilities are calculated
using our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized borrowing over the term of each individual lease. Minimum lease
payments include only fixed lease components of the agreement, as well as variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured
using the index at the lease commencement date.
Operating lease assets represent our right to
use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial direct
costs and lease incentives. Lease incentives are recognized when earned and reduce our operating lease asset related to the lease. They
are amortized through the operating lease assets as reductions of rent expense over the lease term.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s operating leases contain clauses that provide for contingent rent based on a
percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, escalation
in the index subsequent to the initial measurement, payments associated with non-lease components such as common area maintenance, real
estate taxes and insurance, and short-term lease payments (leases with a term with 12 months or less) are expensed as incurred or when
the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent is considered probable.
12
Table of Contents
Some of the leases provide for base rent, plus
additional rent based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement. The Company is also generally obligated to pay certain real
estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges, and various other expenses related to properties, which are expensed as incurred.

generally has escalating rents over the term of the leases and records rent expense on a straight-line basis.
Note 13.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-Lived Assets.
We review our
long-lived assets including land, property, and equipment for impairment when there are factors that indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recovery of assets at the individual restaurant level and typically include an analysis
of historical cash flows, future operating plans, and cash flow projections in assessing whether there are indicators of impairment. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the net book value of the assets of an individual restaurant to the fair value
of those assets. This impairment process involves significant judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions pertaining to future projections
and operating results.
There were no impairments in the fiscal quarters
ended December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021.
13
Table of Contents
Trademarks.
Trademarks have been
determined to have an indefinite life. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment annually and on an interim basis as events and circumstances
warrant by comparing the fair value of the trademarks with their carrying amount. There was no impairment required to the acquired trademarks
as of December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021.
Goodwill.
Goodwill represents the
excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses the Company acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather, the Company is
required to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indications of impairment arise. The Company considers its operations
to be comprised of two reporting units: (1) Good Times restaurants and (2) Bad Daddy’s restaurants. As of December 27, 2022, the
Company had $ 96,000
of goodwill attributable to the Good Times reporting unit and $ 5,617,000
of goodwill attributable to its Bad Daddy’s
reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized as of December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021.
Note 14.
Income Taxes
We account
for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will
be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to their estimated realizable value. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances
are adjusted as necessary.
The Company had net loss for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 and net income for the quarter ended December 28, 2021, we have significant net operating loss carryforwards from prior years and a history of net losses through the duration of our existence. Full valuation allowances were established to reduce any deferred tax assets recorded to
zero
for both the quarters ended December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021. Although we have established a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we are subject to income tax in certain jurisdictions where we do not have substantial net operating loss carry forwards. For the quarter ended December 27, 2022 we did not recognize any provision for income taxes as we estimated no current tax liability for either federal or state jurisdictions resulting in an effective income tax rate of
zero
for the period. For the period ended December 28, 2021, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $ 8,000
related to our estimate of current income taxes payable resulting in an effective tax rate of
2.0 %.
The Company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions within
the U.S. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 2019 through 2022. The Company
believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained upon audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that
will result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore,
no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties
related to income tax matters in income tax expense. No accrual for interest and penalties was considered necessary as of December 27,
2022.
Note 15.
Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate
item in the shareholders’ equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amount of consolidated net income or loss
attributable to non-controlling interests is presented on the face of the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Changes in a
parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, while changes in ownership
interest that do result in deconsolidation of a subsidiary require gain or loss recognition based on the fair value on the deconsolidation
date.
The equity interests of the unrelated limited
partners and members are shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the shareholders’ equity section as a non-controlling
interest and is adjusted each period to reflect the limited partners’ and members’ share of the net income or loss as well
as any cash contributions or distributions to or from the limited partners and members for the period. The limited partners’ and
members’ share of the net income or loss in the subsidiary is shown as non-controlling interest income or expense in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated.

Segment Reporting
All of our Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants
(Bad Daddy’s) compete in the full-service segment of the restaurant industry while our Good Times Burgers and Frozen Custard restaurants
(Good Times) compete in the quick-service segment of the dining industry. We believe that providing this additional financial information
for each of our brands will provide a better understanding of our overall operating results. Income (loss) from operations represents
revenues less restaurant operating costs and expenses, directly allocable general and administrative expenses, and other restaurant-level
expenses directly associated with each brand including depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs and losses or gains on disposal
of property and equipment. Unallocated corporate capital expenditures are presented below as reconciling items to the amounts presented

Subsequent Events
On January 24, 2023, the Company
and Cadence amended the Cadence Credit Facility to extend its expiration date to provide consent for the acquisition of certain non-controlling
interests in five Bad Daddy’s restaurant joint-ventures and to provide EBITDA credit with respect to those acquired interests.
On January 25, 2023, the Company
acquired all of the membership interests in five Bad Daddy’s restaurant joint-ventures that it did not already own. The Company’s
remaining non-controlling interests are attributed to a limited partnership with ownership of five Good Times restaurants in which the
Company and the non-controlling partner each own
50 %. The aggregate cash purchase price paid to the Sellers was $ 4,394,205 .

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This Form 10-Q contains or incorporates
by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the disclosure of risk factors in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 27, 2022. Also, documents subsequently filed by us with the SEC and incorporated herein by reference may contain forward-looking
statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and actual results
could differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to the
following:
(I)
The disruption to our business from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the
impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The disruption and effect on our business may
vary depending on the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of federal, state and local governmental actions and
customer behavior in response to the pandemic.
(II)
We compete with numerous well-established competitors who have substantially greater
financial resources and longer operating histories than we do. Competitors have increasingly offered selected food items and combination
meals, including hamburgers, at discounted prices, and continued discounting by competitors may adversely affect revenues and profitability
of Company restaurants.
(III)
We may be negatively impacted if we experience same store sales declines. Same store
sales comparisons will be dependent, among other things, on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items.
No assurances can be given that such advertising and promotions will in fact be successful.
(IV)
We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to pass on to customers through menu
price increases the increased costs that we incur through inflation experienced in our input costs including both the cost of food and
the cost of labor. Recent metrics have indicated that increased levels of price inflation are prevalent throughout the economy which have
resulted in increases in commodity, labor and energy costs for both concepts as well as increased product substitutions, elevated freight
costs, and increased variability in product quality. Further significant increases in inflation could affect the global and U.S. economies,
which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations if we and our franchisees are not able to adjust prices sufficiently
to offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.
We may also be negatively impacted by other factors
common to the restaurant industry such as: changes in consumer tastes away from red meat and fried foods; increases in the cost of food,
paper, labor, health care, workers’ compensation or energy; inadequate number of hourly paid employees; increased wages and salaries
for hourly and salaried employees; and/or decreases in the availability of affordable capital resources. We caution the reader that such
risk factors are not exhaustive, particularly with respect to future filings. For further discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer
to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2022.
Overview.
Good Times Restaurant Inc., through its subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Company” or “we”, “us” or “our”) operates and franchises/licenses
full-service hamburger-oriented restaurants under the name Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar (Bad Daddy’s) and operates and franchises
hamburger-oriented drive-through restaurants under the name Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard (Good Times).
We are focused on targeted unit growth of the
Bad Daddy’s concept while at the same time growing same store sales and improving the profitability of both the Bad Daddy’s
and the Good Times concepts.
Macro-Economic Factors and Operating Environment.
The global crisis resulting from the spread of
coronavirus (“COVID-19”) continued to our restaurant operations for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 although the impact
was more modest than in the prior year. We expect local conditions to continue to dictate limitations on restaurant operations, capacity,
and hours of operation. The lingering impacts of the pandemic have also contributed to labor challenges, which have increased hourly wages
and management salaries at both concepts, and in limited cases have resulted in reduced operating hours at certain restaurants. Supply
chain constraints have affected both of our concepts, resulting in higher food and beverage cost associated with general increases in
input price levels as well as increased product substitutions, elevated freight costs, and increased variability in product quality, primarily
in produce items. In addition, during the quarter ended December 27, 2022, high rates of inflation have been seen globally which have
also resulted in increases in commodity, labor and energy costs for both concepts. Further significant increases in inflation could affect
the global and U.S. economies, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations if we and our franchisees
are not able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.

Table of Contents
Although we conduct all of our restaurant operations
within the USA, worldwide product supply chains have been impacted by the war in Ukraine. Specifically sunflower oil and wheat, which
are fungible commodities, are used as ingredients in our raw materials and purchased by our suppliers, have significant supplies that
typically originate in Ukraine. The lack of availability of supplies of such products may impact the availability and supplier pricing
for products purchased by us for use in our business, which could result in higher food and packaging costs or reduced revenues.
Growth Strategies and Outlook.
We believe there are significant opportunities
to grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our brands. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our development profile as we
sought to improve our financial position, and while we believe there are unit growth opportunities for both of our concepts, we continue
to evaluate that in-line with the inflationary impact currently seen in the restaurant industry. However, we do anticipate the opening
of one new restaurant in late Fiscal 2023 in the greater Huntsville, Alabama market.
Restaurant locations .
As of December 27, 2022, we operated, franchised,
or licensed a total of forty-one Bad Daddy’s restaurants and thirty-one Good Times restaurants. The following table presents the
number of restaurants operating at the end of the first fiscal quarters of 2022 and 2021. Subsequent to the quarter ended December 27,
2022, the Company acquired all of the membership interests in five Bad Daddy’s, four in North Carolina and one in South Carolina.

Table of Contents
Bad Daddy’s restaurant sales increased $575,000
to 25,165,000 for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 from $24,590,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2021. Sales were positively
impacted by and increases in sales due to stronger customer traffic compared to the prior year in connection with easing of COVID restrictions.
The average menu price increase for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 over the same prior-year quarter was approximately 5.3%.
Good Times restaurant sales decreased $72,000
to 8,014,000 for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 from $8,086,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2021. The average menu price increase
for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 over the same prior-year quarter was approximately 8.8%.
Franchise revenues decreased 25,000 to $215,000
in the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to $240,000 in the quarter ended December 28, 2021. This decrease is primarily due to
the acquisition, during the second fiscal quarter of 2022, by the Company of one Bad Daddy’s restaurant previously owned by a franchisee.
Same
Store Sales
Sales store sales is a metric used in evaluating
the performance of established restaurants and is a commonly used metric in the restaurant industry. Same store sales for our brands are
calculated using all company-owned units open for at least eighteen full fiscal months and use the comparable operating weeks from the
prior year to the current year quarter’s operating weeks.
Bad Daddy’s same store restaurant sales
increased 2.4% during the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to the same thirteen-week period ended December 28, 2021 in the prior-year
quarter, primarily driven by strong off premise sales and menu price increases. There were thirty-nine restaurants included in the same
store sales base at the end of the quarter.
Good Times same store restaurant sales increased
3.0% during the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to the same thirteen-week period ended December 28, 2021 in the prior-year quarter,
primarily due to menu price increases, slightly offset by lower traffic. There were twenty-three restaurants included in the same store
sales base at the end of the quarter.
Restaurant
Operating Costs
Food
and Packaging Costs.
Food and packaging costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 increased $381,000 to 10,607,000 (32.0%
of restaurant sales) from $10,226,000 (31.3% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021 .
Bad Daddy’s food and packaging costs were
7,973,000 (31.7% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $7,812,000 (31.8% of restaurant sales) for the
quarter ended December 28, 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to higher restaurant sales during the current fiscal quarter
versus prior fiscal quarter.
Good Times
food and packaging costs were $2,634,000 (32.9% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $2,414,000 (29.9%
of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of higher purchase
prices on food and paper goods, partially offset by the impact of an 8.8% increase in menu pricing.
Payroll
and Other Employee Benefit Costs.
Payroll and other employee benefit costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 increased $371,000
to 11,548,000 (34.8% of restaurant sales) from $11,177,000 (34.2% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Bad Daddy’s
payroll and other employee benefit costs were $8,754,000 (34.8% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 up from $8,418,000
(34.2% of restaurant sales) in the same prior year period. The $336,000 increase is primarily attributable to higher restaurant sales
during the current quarter versus the same quarter in the prior year, as well as higher average pay rates. As a percent of sales, payroll
and employee benefits costs increased by 0.6% primarily attributable to higher average wage rates paid to attract qualified employees.
Good Times
payroll and other employee benefit costs were 2,794,000 (34.9% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $2,759,000
(34.1% of restaurant sales) in the same prior-year period. The $35,000 increase, both in nominal dollars and as measured as a percent
of restaurant sales, was attributable to higher average wage rates paid to attract qualified employees.
Occupancy
Costs.
Occupancy costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 increased $130,000 to $2,458,000 (7.4% of restaurant sales) from
$2,328,000 (7.1% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Bad Daddy’s
occupancy costs were 1,732,000 (6.9% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $1,649,000 (6.7% of restaurant
sales) in the same prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to
additional lease costs associated with the purchase
of our Bad Daddy’s Franchisee in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and increase property tax assessments overall.
18
Table of Contents
Good
Times occupancy costs were $726,000 (9.1% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $679,000 (8.4% of restaurant
sales) in the same prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increased property and liability insurance costs.
Other
Operating Costs.
Other operating costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, increased $354,000 to $4,492,000 (13.5% of restaurant
sales) from $4,138,000 (12.7% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Bad
Daddy’s other operating costs were $3,521,000 (14.0% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 up from $3,285,000
(13.4% of restaurant sales) in the same prior year period. The $236,000 increase and the increase as a percentage of sales was attributable
to higher overall sales, increased repair and maintenance expenses, increased third party delivery fees, and increased payroll service
fees.
Good Times other operating costs were $971,000
(12.1% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 27, 2022, up from $853,000 (10.5% of restaurant sales) in the same prior year
period. The increase was primarily attributable to general price inflation in supplies costs and increases in commissions paid to delivery
service providers due to increases in overall delivery sales.
New Store Preopening Costs.
In the
quarter ended December 27, 2022, there were no preopening costs compared to $50,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization Costs .
Depreciation and amortization costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, decreased $74,000 to 910,000 from $984,000 in the quarter
ended December 28, 2021.
Bad Daddy’s depreciation and amortization
costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 decreased $11,000 to $773,000 from $784,000 in the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Good Times depreciation and amortization costs
for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 decreased $63,000 to $137,000 from $200,000 in the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
General and Administrative Costs.
General and administrative costs for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, decreased $330,000 to $2,375,000 (7.1% of total revenues) from
$2,705,000 (8.2% of total revenue) for the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
This decrease in general and administrative expenses
in the quarter ended December 27, 2022 is primarily attributable to:
●
Decrease in professional services of $267,000
●
Decrease in Office lease and equipment expense of
$24,000
●
Decrease in general travel related expenses of $17,000
●
Decrease in home office payroll ad benefit costs
of $27,000
●
Decrease in insurance costs of $84,000
●
Decrease in Stock Compensation costs of $49,000
●
Decrease in other costs of $19,000
●
Increase in recruiting and training related costs
of $28,000
●
Increase in costs associated with new multi-unit
supervisory roles of $23,000
●
Increase in administrative, accounting, and technology
costs of $106,000
For the balance of the fiscal year, we expect
general and administrative costs to trend similarly in nominal terms to costs incurred during the current quarter.
Advertising Costs.
Advertising costs
for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, increased to $894,000 (2.7% of sales from $641,000 (1.9% of total revenue) for the quarter ended
December 28, 2021.
Bad Daddy’s advertising costs were $610,000
(2.4% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to $314,000 (1.3% of total revenue) in the same prior year
period. The increase is primarily due to recognition of commission earned by third parties on gift cards sold through large-box retailers.
Bad Daddy’s advertising costs consist primarily of menu development, printing costs, local store marketing and social media .
The current quarter had no advertising costs associated with franchise contributions. The prior year quarter includes advertising costs
of $4,000 associated with franchise advertising contributions.
Bad Daddy’s
advertising costs consist primarily of a combination of menus and other point of purchase materials, digital advertising, and commissions
incurred for placement of gift parties at third party retailers, as well as local store marketing efforts.
Good Times
advertising costs were $284,000 (3.5% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to $327,000 (4.0% of total
revenue) in the same prior year period. The current and prior year quarters include advertising costs of $66,000 and $67,000, respectively,
of costs associated with franchise advertising contributions.
Good Times
advertising costs consist primarily of contributions made to the advertising materials fund and a regional advertising cooperative based
on a percentage of restaurant sales which are used to provide television and radio advertising, social media and on-site and point-of-purchase.
Advertising costs are presented gross, with franchisee contributions to the fund being recognized as a component of franchise revenues.
As a percentage of total revenue, we expect advertising costs to remain relatively stable on an annual basis, at approximately 3.5% of
total revenue for the Good Times segment, though because we consolidate the advertising fund into our results, quarterly costs will fluctuate.

Table of Contents
Franchise
Costs.
Franchise costs were $3,000 and $5,000 for the quarters ended December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021, respectively. The
costs are related to the Good Times franchised restaurants. We currently have minimal direct costs associated with maintaining our franchise
systems as those employees overseeing franchisee relations primarily perform responsibilities associated with company operations.
Gain
on Restaurant Asset Sales and Lease Termination.
The gain on restaurant asset sales and lease termination for the quarter ended
December 27, 2022 was zero, which is composed of a net $8,000 loss on disposal of miscellaneous assets, offset by $8,000 of deferred gains,
compared to $614,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2021, of which $607,000 is attributable to gains in connection with a lease termination
at a Good Times restaurant and the remainder primarily attributable to deferred gains on prior sale-leaseback transactions of certain
Good Times restaurants.
Income
from Operations .
Income from operations was $107,000 in the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to income from operations
of $1,276,000 in the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
The
change in the income from operations for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 is due primarily due to matters discussed in the “Net
Revenues,” “Restaurant Operating Costs,” “General and Administrative Costs”, “Advertising Costs” ,
and “Gain on Restaurant Sales and Lease Termination”
sections above.
Interest
Expense.
Interest expense was $12,000 during the quarter ended December 27, 2022, primarily related to the amortization of loan
initiation fees, compared with $18,000 during the quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Provision
for Income Taxes.
There was no provision for income taxes for the quarter ended December 27, 2022, compared to $8,000 for the
quarter ended December 28, 2021.
Net
Income .
Net income was $95,000 for the quarter ended December 27, 2022 compared to net income of $1,258,000 in the quarter ended
December 28, 2021.
The
change from the quarter ended December 27, 2022 to the quarter ended December 28, 2021 was primarily attributable to the matters discussed
in the relevant sections above.
Income
Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests .
The non-controlling interest represents the limited partners’ or members’
share of income in the Good Times and Bad Daddy’s joint-venture restaurants.
For
the quarter ended December 27, 2022, the income attributable to non-controlling interests was $222,000 compared to $920,000 for the quarter
ended December 28, 2021.
Of the current
quarter’s income attributable to non-controlling interests, $179,000 is attributable to Bad Daddy’s joint-venture restaurants,
compared to $684,000 in the same prior year period. This $505,000 decrease is primarily due to a one-time special allocation to the non-controlling
partners in these partnerships of approximately $516,000 in the quarter ended December 28, 2021 related to a rebate of payroll costs,
partially offset by slightly decreased restaurant level profitability in the current fiscal quarter. Of the current quarter’s income,
$43,000 is attributable to the Good Times joint-venture restaurants, compared to $236,000 in the same prior year period. This $193,000
decrease is primarily due to decreased restaurant level profitability in the current fiscal quarter.
Subsequent to the quarter
ended December 27, 2022, the Company acquired all of the membership interests in five Bad Daddy’s as described in Note 17 to the
unaudited, consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Adjusted
EBITDA
EBITDA
is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, preopening expense, non-recurring acquisition costs, GAAP
rent in excess of cash rent, and non-cash disposal of assets. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance
that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to
management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. Our
management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation
and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
We
believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results
and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other fast casual restaurants, which may present similar non-GAAP financial
measures to investors. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses
similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference
that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable
to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
20
Table of Contents
Our
management does not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance
with GAAP. The principal limitation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required
by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. Some of these limitations are:
●
Adjusted
EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
●
Adjusted
EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
●
Adjusted
EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;
●
although
depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future,
and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
●
stock
based compensation expense is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude
it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing performance for a particular period;
●
Adjusted
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;
and
●
other
companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because
of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a
supplemental measure. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single
financial measure to evaluate our business.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Cash and Working Capital
As of December 27, 2022, we had a working capital
deficit of $2,042,000. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the
same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within a few days of the related sale. Although we have negotiated payment
terms of up to four weeks with many of our vendors, we pay our primary foodservice vendors on 1-3 day payment terms to take advantage
of early pay discounts and generally pay most outstanding accounts payable upon review for accuracy and validity. In addition, our working
capital position includes the recognition of the current portion of lease liabilities as we lease substantially all of our real estate
and have both short-term and long-term obligations to our landlords. We believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working
capital, recurring operating costs and recurring capital expenditure needs throughout fiscal 2023. As of December 27, 2022, we had no
commitments related to construction contracts for any restaurants currently under development.

Table of Contents
On January 31, 2022 the Company‘s Board
of Directors authorized a $5.0 Million share repurchase program which became effective February 7, 2022. The authorization to repurchase
will continue until the maximum value of shares is achieved or the Company terminates the program. The timing and amount of repurchases
will depend upon the Company’s stock price, economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations .
Financing
Cadence
Credit Facility
The Company maintains a credit agreement with
Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to $8,000,000, which as of December
27, 2022 had a maturity date of January 31, 2023 (the “Cadence Credit Facility”). The Cadence Credit Facility accrues commitment
fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25%. As of December 27, 2022, any borrowings under the Cadence Credit
Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus the base rate, which is
the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence bank publicly announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii)
LIBOR, with a 0.250% floor, plus 3.5%. Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company selects to pay interest based
on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR. The Cadence Credit Facility includes
provisions for the Administrative Agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, which
may be (but is not required to be) SOFR, at such point in time when appliable LIBOR rates are no longer available or no longer reliable.
The exact timing of any transition of LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate is not currently known.
During the fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2022,
the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility was 7.8%.
The Cadence Credit Facility contains certain affirmative
and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this type, including covenants setting
a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1, a minimum post-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of $2.0 million. As of December 27, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all
financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility.
As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit
Facility and the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately $308,500 and
is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement. The remaining amount to be amortized as of December 27, 2022 is $13,000.
The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on
substantially all of the Company’s assets.
As
of the date of filing this Form 10-Q, there were no outstanding borrowings against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility
for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of filing this Form 10-Q,
there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.
On
January 24, 2023, subsequent to the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2022, the Company and Cadence amended the Cadence Credit
Facility to extend its expiration date to April 30, 2023, to provide consent for the Company’s acquisition of certain non-controlling
interests in Bad Daddy’s limited liability company partnerships, and to provide pro-forma credit for a portion of the full-year
EBITDA, as that term is defined in the Cadence Credit Facility previously attributed to the non-controlling partners in those limited
liability company partnerships.
The Company is currently reviewing its future credit facility needs and expects to negotiate an
amendment to the existing credit agreement or enter into a new credit agreement prior to the current maturity date of April 30, 2023.

Impact
of Inflation
Commodity prices, particularly for key proteins
have recently been at near-record highs and have exhibited extreme volatility. Though we have seen some moderation in certain commodities,
we continue to experience higher year-over-year prices on many goods, including food and beverage items, paper and packaging, other restaurant
supplies, and energy (utilities) costs. Due to the volatility in commodity pricing, we are unable to reasonably predict the impact of
future inflationary pressures.
In addition to food cost inflation, we have also
experienced the need to meaningfully increase wages to attract workers in our restaurants. While we are hopeful that wage rate inflation
moderates, the persistent shortage of qualified workers, rather than statutory wage rate increases, which have traditionally created rate
pressure, is the primary factor creating upward pressure on wages, as demand for labor is currently significantly exceeding the supply
of qualified workers.
We have historically used menu price increases
to manage profitability in times of inflation, however the current unusually high rate of inflation, both of goods and labor, exceeds
what we believe we can reasonably pass through to our customers without negatively affecting frequency and trial by our customers.
Seasonality
Revenues of the Company are subject to seasonal
fluctuations based on weather conditions adversely affecting Colorado restaurant sales primarily during the months of December, January,
February, and March .
