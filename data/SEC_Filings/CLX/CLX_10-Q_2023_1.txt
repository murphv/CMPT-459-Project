NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of The Clorox Company and its controlled subsidiaries (the Company or Clorox) for the periods presented. However, the financial results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year or for any other future period.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted or condensed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information in this report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which includes a complete set of footnote disclosures, including the Company’s significant accounting policies. Restructuring Liabilities The Company incurs restructuring costs in connection with workforce reductions; consolidation or closure of a facility; sale or termination of a line of business; and other actions. Such costs include employee termination benefits (one-time arrangements and benefits attributable to prior service), termination of contractual obligations, non-cash asset charges and other direct incremental costs. The Company records employee termination liabilities once they are both probable and estimable for severance provided under the Company’s existing severance policy. Employee termination liabilities outside of the Company’s existing severance policy are recognized at the time relevant employees are notified, unless the employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period for transition purposes, in which case the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period. Other costs associated with a restructuring plan or exit or disposal activities, such as consulting and professional fees, facility exit costs, employee relocation, outplacement costs, accelerated depreciation or asset impairments associated with a restructuring plan, are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred or the asset is impaired. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04, "Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.” These amendments require disclosure of the key terms of outstanding supplier finance programs and a rollforward of the related obligations. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. As these amendments relate to disclosures only, there are no impacts expected to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. NOTE 2.
RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began recognizing costs related to a plan that involves streamlining its operating model to meet its objectives of driving growth and productivity. The streamlined operating model is expected to enhance the Company’s ability to respond more quickly to changing consumer behaviors and innovate faster. The Company anticipates the implementation of this new model will be completed in fiscal year 2024, with different phases occurring throughout the implementation period. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $ 75
to $ 100
of costs in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 related to this initiative, of which approximately $ 40
to $ 60
is expected to be incurred in fiscal year 2023. Related costs are primarily expected to include employee-related costs to reduce certain staffing levels such as severance payments, as well as for consulting and other costs. Costs incurred are expected to be settled primarily in cash. 5 Restructuring and related implementation costs, net were $ 4
and $ 23
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
The following table summarizes the total restructuring and related implementation costs, net associated with the Company’s streamlined operating model plan as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2022 Costs of products sold $ —   $ ( 1 ) Selling and administrative expenses 4 5   Other (income) expense, net: Employee-related costs —   19   Total, net $ 4   $ 23   Employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits calculated based on salary levels, prior service and statutory requirements. Other costs primarily include consulting fees incurred for the organizational design and implementation of the future streamlined operating model, related processes and other professional fees incurred.
Charges for restructuring and related implementation costs are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring-related initiatives that involve costs in future periods.
The following tables reconcile the accrual for the streamlined operating model restructuring and related implementation costs discussed above, which are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: Three Months Ended December 31 Employee-Related Costs Other Total Accrual Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 19   $ 3   $ 22   Charges —   4 4 Cash payments ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 11 ) Accrual Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 13   $ 2   $ 15   Six Months Ended December 31 Employee-Related Costs Other Total Accrual Balance as of June 30, 2022 $ —   $ —   $ —   Charges 19 7 26 Cash payments ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 11 ) Accrual Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 13   $ 2   $ 15   6 NOTE 3.

OTHER LIABILITIES Venture Agreement The Company has an agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business. In connection with this agreement, P&G provides research and development (R&D) support to the Glad business. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, P&G had a
20 % interest in the venture. The Company pays a royalty to P&G for its interest in the profits, losses and cash flows, as contractually defined, of the Glad business, which is included in Cost of products sold. In December 2017, the Company and P&G extended the term of the agreement and the related R&D support provided by P&G. The term will expire in January 2026, unless the parties agree, on or prior to January 31, 2025, to further extend the term of the agreement for another
seven years
or agree to take some other relevant action. The agreement can be terminated earlier under certain circumstances, including at P&G’s option upon a change in control of the Company or, at either party’s option, upon the sale of the Glad business by the Company. Upon termination of the agreement, the Company is required to purchase P&G’s
20 % interest for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest in the venture was $ 527
and $ 635 , respectively. Of the estimated fair value, $ 489
and $ 468
has been recognized and is reflected in Other liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&G’s interest, is charged to Cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement. Following termination, the Glad business will retain the exclusive core intellectual property licenses contributed by P&G on a royalty-free basis for the licensed products marketed. 7 NOTE 5.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial Risk Management and Derivative Instruments The Company is exposed to certain commodity, foreign currency and interest rate risks related to its ongoing business operations and uses derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to these risks. Commodity Price Risk Management The Company may use commodity futures, options and swap contracts to limit the impact of price volatility on a portion of its forecasted raw material requirements. These commodity derivatives may be exchange traded or over-the-counter contracts and generally have original contractual maturities of less than
two years . Commodity purchase and options contracts are measured at fair value using market quotations obtained from the Chicago Board of Trade commodity futures exchange and commodity derivative dealers. As of both December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the notional amount of commodity derivatives was $ 27 , which related primarily to exposures in soybean oil used for the Food products business and jet fuel used for the Grilling business. Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company may also enter into certain over-the-counter derivative contracts to manage a portion of the Company’s forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with the purchase of inventory. These foreign currency contracts generally have original contractual maturities of less than
two years . The foreign exchange contracts are measured at fair value using information quoted by foreign exchange dealers. The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used by the Company’s subsidiaries to hedge forecasted purchases of inventory were $ 56
and $ 31
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Interest Rate Risk Management The Company may enter into over-the-counter interest rate contracts to fix a portion of the benchmark interest rate prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. These interest rate contracts generally have original contractual maturities of less than
three years . The interest rate contracts are measured at fair value using information quoted by bond dealers. The Company held no interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Commodity, Foreign Exchange and Interest Rate Derivatives
The Company designates its commodity forward, futures and options contracts for forecasted purchases of raw materials, foreign currency forward contracts for forecasted purchases of inventory and interest rate contracts for forecasted interest payments as cash flow hedges. 8 NOTE 5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) The effects of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments on Other comprehensive (loss) income and Net earnings were as follows: Gains (losses) recognized in Other comprehensive (loss) income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Commodity purchase derivative contracts $ 1   $ 2   $ ( 2 ) $ 2   Foreign exchange derivative contracts ( 1 ) —   —   1   Interest rate derivative contracts —   ( 3 ) —   —   Total $ —   $ ( 1 ) $ ( 2 ) $ 3   Location of gains (losses) reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive net (loss) income into Net earnings Gains (losses) reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive net (loss) income and recognized in Net earnings Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Commodity purchase derivative contracts Cost of products sold $ 3   $ 5   $ 7   $ 10   Foreign exchange derivative contracts Cost of products sold —   —   1   —   Interest rate derivative contracts Interest expense 3   ( 1 ) 6   ( 3 ) Total $ 6   $ 4   $ 14   $ 7   The estimated amount of the existing net gain (loss) in Accumulated other comprehensive net (loss) income as of December 31, 2022 that is expected to be reclassified into Net earnings within the next twelve months is $ 13 .
Counterparty Risk Management and Derivative Contract Requirements The Company utilizes a variety of financial institutions as counterparties for over-the-counter derivative instruments. The Company enters into agreements governing the use of over-the-counter derivative instruments and sets internal limits on the aggregate over-the-counter derivative instrument positions held with each counterparty. Certain terms of these agreements require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral when the fair value of the derivative instruments exceeds contractually-defined counterparty liability position limits. Of the over-the-counter derivative instruments in liability positions held as of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $ 0
contained such terms. As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, neither the Company nor any counterparty was required to post any collateral as no counterparty liability position limits were exceeded. Certain terms of the agreements governing the Company’s over-the-counter derivative instruments require the Company’s credit ratings, as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s to the Company and its counterparties, to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating. If the Company’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investment grade ratings by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Certain of the Company’s exchange traded futures and options contracts used for commodity price risk management include requirements for the Company to post collateral in the form of a cash margin account held by the Company’s broker for trades conducted on that exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company maintained cash margin balances related to exchange traded futures and options contracts of $ 2
and $ 1 , respectively, which are classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 9 NOTE 5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Trust Assets The Company holds interests in mutual funds and cash equivalents as part of trust assets related to its nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The participants in the nonqualified deferred compensation plans, who are the Company’s current and former employees, may select among certain mutual funds in which their compensation deferrals are invested in accordance with the terms of the plans and within the confines of the trusts, which hold the marketable securities. The trusts represent variable interest entities for which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary, and therefore, trust assets are consolidated and included in Other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The interests in mutual funds are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. The Company has designated these marketable securities as trading investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions. As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis included derivative financial instruments, which were classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, and trust assets to fund the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which were classified as Level 1. All of the Company’s derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting.

Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. (2) Notes and loans payable are composed of outstanding U.S. commercial paper balances and/or amounts drawn on the Company’s credit agreements, all of which are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. (3) Current maturities of long-term debt and Long-term debt are recorded at cost. The fair value of Long-term debt, including current maturities, was determined using secondary market prices quoted by corporate bond dealers, and is classified as Level 2. NOTE 6.
INCOME TAXES In determining its quarterly provision for income taxes, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. The effective tax rate on earnings was
21.2 % and
23.0 % for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and
23.1 % and
22.8 % for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The Inflation Reduction Act (the “Act”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The Act introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax for certain large corporations that becomes effective at the beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2024 and it imposes a 1% excise tax on the value of share repurchases, net of new share issuances, after December 31, 2022. These provisions, as well as the other corporate tax changes included in the Act, are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a domestic qualified pension plan (the Plan). The Plan is frozen for all participants. The Plan generally was frozen effective June 30, 2011 for all employees, except for certain collectively bargained employees, whose Plan freeze was effective January 1, 2019. As a result of the Plan freeze, no employees are eligible to commence participation in the Plan or accrue any additional benefits under the Plan. On May 17, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Plan. The amendment will allow the settlement of the pension obligation with either a lump sum payout or a purchased annuity. It is expected to take
18
to
24
months to complete the termination from the date of the approved resolution to terminate the Plan. The completion of the process of offering and accepting lump sum elections are dependent on when certain regulatory approvals are obtained. Currently, there is not enough information available to determine the ultimate charge of the termination. The Plan is fully funded under specified Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) funding rules as of December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s retirement income plans: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Interest cost $ 4   $ 4   $ 9   $ 8   Expected return on plan assets

2.7 %. The net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s retirement health care plans was $ 0
for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made $ 2
in contributions to its domestic retirement income plans. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made $ 4
and $ 5
in contributions to its domestic retirement income plans, respectively. Service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost, if any, is reflected in employee benefit costs, all other components are reflected in Other (income) expense, net. NOTE 11.
OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES Contingencies The Company is involved in certain environmental matters, including response actions at various locations. The Company had recorded liabilities totaling
$ 26
and $ 28
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to these matters.
One matter, which accounted fo r $ 12
and $ 14
of the recorded liability as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, relates to environmental costs associated with one of the Company’s former operations at a site located in Alameda County, California. In November 2016, at the request of regulators and with the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company submitted a Feasibility Study that evaluated various options for managing the site and included estimates of the related costs. Following further discussions with the regulators in 2017, the Company recorded an undiscounted liability for costs estimated to be incurred over a
30-year
period, based on one of the options in the Feasibility Study. In September 2021, as a result of an additional study and further discussions with regulators, the Company submitted a Soil Vapor Intrusion Report to the regulators, which has not resulted in a change to the recorded liability. While the Company believes its latest estimates of remediation costs are reasonable, the ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized and the regulators could require the Company to implement remediation actions for a longer period or take additional actions, which could include estimated undiscounted costs of up to approximately $ 28
over an estimated
30-year
period, or require the Company to take different actions and incur additional costs.
Another matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, at the site of one of the Company’s former operations for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounted for
$ 9
of the recorded liability as of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. This amount reflects the Company’s agreement to be liable for
24.3 % of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a cost-sharing agreement with a third party. If the third party is unable to pay its share of the response and
15 NOTE 11: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES (continued) remediation obligations, the Company may be responsible for such obligations. With the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated
30-year
remediation period. Although it is reasonably possible that the Company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for the Dickinson County matter, any amount of such additional exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time.
The Company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of any remediation efforts, changes in any remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative clean-up technologies. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies, including, without limitation, loss contingencies relating to contractual arrangements (including costs connected to the transition and unwinding of certain supply and manufacturing relationships), product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, labor and employment, environmental, health and safety and other matters. With respect to these proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management at this time, the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. Guarantees In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company may provide typical indemnifications (e.g., indemnifications for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) that have terms that vary in duration and in the potential amount of the total obligation and, in many circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The Company has not made, nor does it believe that it is probable that it will make, any material payments relating to its indemnifications, and believes that any reasonably possible payments would not have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The Company had not recorded any material liabilities on the aforementioned guarantees as of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company was a party to letters of credit of
$ 14
as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to its insurance carriers, of which
$ 0
had been drawn upon. 16 NOTE 12.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Clorox Company (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of The Clorox Company’s (the Company or Clorox) financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The following discussion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 10, 2022, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report). Unless otherwise noted, MD&A compares the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 (the current period) to the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2021 (the prior period), with percentage and basis point calculations based on rounded numbers, except for per share data and the effective tax rate. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Clorox is a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products with approximately 9,000 employees worldwide. Clorox sells its products primarily through mass retailers, grocery outlets, warehouse clubs, dollar stores, home hardware centers, drug, pet and military stores, third-party and owned e-commerce channels, and distributors. Clorox markets some of the most trusted and recognized consumer brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products, Pine-Sol ®
cleaners; Liquid-Plumr ®
clog removers; Poett ®
home care products; Fresh Step ®
cat litter; Glad ®

vitamins, minerals and supplements. The Company also markets industry-leading products and technologies for professional customers, including those sold under the CloroxPro ™
and Clorox Healthcare ®
brand names. The Company has operations in more than 25 countries or territories and sells its products in more than 100 markets. The Company primarily markets its leading brands in midsized categories considered to be financially attractive. Most of the Company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands. The Company operates through strategic business units (SBUs) that are organized into the Company’s operating segments. These operating segments are then aggregated into four reportable segments: Health and Wellness, Household, Lifestyle and International. These four reportable segments consist of the following: • Health and Wellness
consists of cleaning products, professional products and vitamins, minerals and supplements mainly marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include cleaning products such as laundry additives and home care products, primarily under the Clorox ® , Clorox2 ® , Scentiva ® , Pine-Sol, Liquid-Plumr, Tilex ®
and Formula 409 ®
brands; professional cleaning and disinfecting products under the CloroxPro and Clorox Healthcare brands; professional food service products under the Hidden Valley brand; and vitamins, minerals and supplements under the RenewLife, Natural Vitality, NeoCell
and Rainbow Light brands. • Household
consists of bags and wraps, grilling products and cat litter marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include bags and wraps under the Glad brand; grilling products under the Kingsford brand; and cat litter primarily under the Fresh Step
and Scoop Away ®
brands. • Lifestyle
consists of food, natural personal care products and water-filtration products marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include dressings, dips, seasonings and sauces, primarily under the Hidden Valley brand; natural personal care products under the Burt’s Bees brand; and water-filtration products under the Brita brand. • International
consists of products sold outside the U.S. Products within this segment include laundry additives, home care products, water-filtration products, digestive health products; grilling products; cat litter; food; bags and wraps; natural personal care products; and professional cleaning and disinfecting products marketed primarily under the Clorox, Ayudin ® , Clorinda ® , Poett, Pine-Sol, Glad, Brita, RenewLife, Ever Clean ®
and Burt’s Bees brands. 19 RECENT EVENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company continued to experience supply chain disruptions including the impacts of cost inflation resulting in persistently high manufacturing and logistics costs as well as higher commodity costs.
In addition to these evolving challenges, ongoing
uncertainties and economic and social disruptions remained present due to the continued effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which were further heightened by the conflict in Ukraine that began in the previous fiscal year. While demand for many of the products across the Company's portfolio remained strong compared to pre-pandemic levels, it has moderated versus the initial periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. An
inflationary environment marked by supply chain disruptions, higher manufacturing and logistics costs and higher commodity costs is expected to continue through fiscal year 2023. While we have not experienced significant disruptions in our operations during fiscal year 2023 to date, the risks of future negative impacts due to transportation, logistical or supply constraints and higher commodity costs for certain raw materials remain present, and the Company continues to experience corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures. For fiscal year 2023, the Company’s focus will be on addressing supply chain disruptions and volatility in commodity costs and foreign exchange markets and countering inflationary pressures through pricing actions and cost-cutting measures. In order to enhance the Company’s ability to respond more quickly to changing consumer behaviors and innovate faster, the Company has announced a streamlined operating model to be implemented over the course of fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The impact of continued inflationary pressures and geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine, have increased global economic and political uncertainty due to the uncertainty around the duration and resolution of the conflict and potential economic and global supply chain disruptions. Additionally, the extent of COVID-19’s effect on the Company’s operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in different countries, the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants, the Company’s continued ability to manufacture and distribute its products, any future government actions affecting consumers, our business operations, including any vaccine mandates, or the economy in general, and effectiveness of global vaccines. All of these factors are difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape as the Company continues to expect a variable operating environment going forward.
For additional information on the impacts and our response to the coronavirus pandemic, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Exhibit 99.1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. 20 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change Net sales $ 1,715  $ 1,691  1  % $ 3,455  $ 3,497  (1) % Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Percentage change versus the year-ago period Reported (GAAP) Net Sales Growth / (Decrease) Reported Volume Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Impact Price/Mix/ Other

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of organic sales growth / (decrease) to net sales growth / (decrease), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (3) Organic volume represents volume excluding the effect of any acquisitions and divestitures. Net sales
in the current three month period increased by 1%, primarily driven by sales growth in the Household reportable segment, partially offset by lower sales in the Health and Wellness reportable segment. Volume decreased by 10% versus the prior period primarily due to pricing actions. The variance between volume and net sales was primarily due to the impact of favorable price mix. Net sales
and volume in the current six month period decreased by 1% and 13%, respectively, reflecting lower shipments across all reportable segments primarily due to pricing actions. The variance between volume and net sales was primarily due to the impact of favorable price mix. 21 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change Gross profit $ 620  $ 558  11  % $ 1,246  $ 1,228  1  % Gross margin 36.2  % 33.0  % 36.1  % 35.1  % Gross margin

The dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses in both the current three and six month periods was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and the Company’s digital capabilities and productivity enhancements investments.
Advertising costs , as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 80 basis points in both the current three and six month periods versus the prior periods. The dollar decrease in advertising costs in both the current three and six month periods was primarily due to the timing of advertising spend. The Company’s U.S. retail advertising spend as a percentage of net sales was 10% in the current and prior three month periods. Research and development costs ,
as a percentage of net sales, were essentially flat in the current three and six month periods as compared to the prior periods. The Company continues to invest behind product innovation and cost savings. Interest expense, Other (income) expense, net and the effective tax rate on earnings Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Interest expense $ 23  $ 23  $ 45  $ 48  Other (income) expense, net (4) —  30  9  Effective tax rate on earnings 21.2  % 23.1  % 23.0  % 22.8  % 22 Other (income) expense, net
was $(4) and $0 in the current and prior three month periods, respectively, and $30 and $9 in the current and prior six month periods, respectively. The variance in the current three month period was not significant. The variance between the current and prior six month periods was primarily due to restructuring and related implementation costs associated with the streamlined operating model incurred in the current period.
Restructuring and related costs In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began recognizing costs related to a plan that involves streamlining its operating model to meet its objectives of driving growth and productivity. The streamlined operating model is expected to enhance the Company’s ability to respond more quickly to changing consumer behaviors and innovate faster. The Company anticipates the implementation of this new model will be completed in fiscal year 2024, with different phases occurring throughout the implementation period. Once fully implemented, the Company expects annual cost savings to be approximately $75 to $100 annually, with benefits of approximately $25 anticipated in fiscal year 2023. The benefits of the streamlined operating model are currently expected to increase future cash flows as a result of cost savings that will be generated primarily in the areas of selling and administration, supply chain, marketing and research and development. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $75 to $100 of costs in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 related to this initiative, of which approximately $40 to $60 is expected to be incurred in fiscal year 2023. Related costs are primarily expected to include employee-related costs to reduce certain staffing levels such as severance payments, as well as for consulting and other costs. Costs incurred are expected to be settled primarily in cash. Restructuring and related implementation costs, net were $4 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which was related to other costs. Restructuring and related implementation costs, net were $23 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, of which $16 was related to employee-related costs and $7 was related to other costs. For further details on the streamlined operating model and restructuring, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The effective tax rate on earnings
was 21.2% and 23.0% for the current three and six months periods, respectively, and 23.1% and 22.8% for the prior three and six month periods, respectively.

increased by $0.24, or 43%, in the current three month period, primarily due to net sales growth, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. Diluted EPS
decreased by $0.21 or 12% in the current six month period, primarily due to unfavorable commodity costs, higher selling and administrative expenses and manufacturing and logistics costs, decreased volume and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the net impact of pricing and cost savings. 23 SEGMENT RESULTS

Consequently, gains and losses from non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of Clorox Argentina are recognized in Other (income) expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. The business environment in Argentina continues to be challenging due to significant volatility in Argentina’s currency, high inflation, economic recession and impacts of COVID-19. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the net asset position, excluding goodwill, of Clorox Argentina was $46 and $45, respectively. Of these net assets, cash balances were approximately $18 and $15 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Net sales from Clorox Argentina represented approximately 2% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for both the six months ended December 31, 2022 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
For additional information on the impacts of, and our response to, the business environment in Argentina, refer to “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Corporate Corporate includes certain non-allocated administrative costs, interest income, interest expense and various other non-operating income and expenses. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 % Change Losses before income taxes $ (115) $ (72) 60  % $ (219) $ (151) 45  % Losses before income taxes increased by $43 and $68 in the current three and six month periods, respectively, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and the Company’s digital capabilities and productivity enhancement investments. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company’s financial condition and liquidity remained strong as of December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes cash activities: Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Net cash provided by operations $ 387  $ 222  Net cash used for investing activities (87) (112) Net cash used for financing activities (315) (235) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations was $387 in the current six month period, compared with $222 in the prior six month period. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in working capital and lower incentive compensation paid in the current six month period. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to lower inventory balances mostly driven by optimization of inventory levels from the prior six month period, decreased accounts receivable driven by the timing of sales and higher Accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments in the current six month period. Payment Terms Extension and Supply Chain Financing
The Company initiated the extension of its payment terms with its suppliers in the second half of fiscal year 2020 in order to improve working capital as part of and to fund the IGNITE strategy and in keeping with evolving market practices. The Company’s current payment terms do not exceed 120 days in keeping with industry standards. The Company’s operating cash flows are directly impacted as a result of the extension of the payment terms with the suppliers. As part of those ongoing efforts, the Company has arranged for a global financial institution to offer a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program for the benefit of the Company’s suppliers. Leveraging the Company’s credit rating, the SCF program enables suppliers to directly contract with the financial institution to receive payment from the financial institution prior to the payment terms between the Company and the supplier by selling the Company’s payables to the financial institution. Participation in the program is at the sole discretion of the supplier and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier's
26 decision to enter into the agreement and has no direct financial relationship with the financial institution, as it relates to the SCF program. Once a supplier elects to participate in the SCF program and reaches an agreement with the financial institution, the supplier elects which individual Company invoices to sell to the financial institution. The terms of the Company’s payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the program and as such, the SCF program has no direct impact on the Company’s balance sheets, cash flows or liquidity. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. There would not be an expected material impact to the Company’s liquidity or capital resources if the financial institution or a supplier terminated the SCF arrangement. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $200 and $211, respectively. While the Company does not have direct access to information on, or influence over, which invoices a participating supplier elects to sell to the financial institution, the Company expects that the majority of these amounts have been sold to the financial institution. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $87 in the current six month period, compared with $112 in the prior six month period. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to lower capital spending in the current six month period. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $315 in the current six month period, compared with $235 in the prior six month period. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to lower net cash sourced from borrowings, partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases in the current six month period. Capital Resources and Liquidity The Company's current liabilities may periodically exceed current assets as a result of the Company's debt management policies, including the Company's use of commercial paper borrowings which fluctuates depending on the amount and timing of operating and investing cash flows and payments for shareholder transactions such as dividends. In addition, the Company’s cash generated from operations has decreased from historical levels primarily due to higher manufacturing and logistics costs and unfavorable commodity costs. The Company continues to take actions to address some of the effects of such cost increases, which include implementing price increases, driving cost savings and optimizing the Company’s supply chain. Global financial markets have experienced a significant increase in volatility due to heightened uncertainty, the impacts of cost inflation and continued economic and social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and other geopolitical circumstances. Notwithstanding potential unforeseen adverse market conditions and as part of the Company’s regular assessment of its cash needs, the Company believes it will have the funds necessary to support our short- and long-term liquidity and operating needs, including the costs related to the announced streamlined operating model and its digital capabilities and productivity enhancements investments, based on our anticipated ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future, access to capital markets enabled by our strong short-term and long-term credit ratings and current borrowing availability. 27 Credit Arrangements As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained a $1,200 revolving credit agreement that matures in March 2027 (the Credit Agreement). There were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and the Company believes that borrowings under the Credit Agreement are and will continue to be available for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes certain restrictive covenants and limitations. The primary restrictive covenant is a minimum ratio of 4.0, calculated as total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other similar non-cash charges and certain other items (Consolidated EBITDA) to total interest expense for the trailing four quarters (Interest Coverage ratio), as defined and described in the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants and limitations in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022, and anticipates being in compliance with all restrictive covenants for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained $30 of foreign and other credit lines, of which $3 was outstanding. Stock Repurchases and Dividend Payments As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two stock repurchase programs: an open-market purchase program with an authorized aggregate purchase amount of up to $2,000, which has no expiration date, and a program to offset the anticipated impact of dilution related to stock-based awards (the Evergreen Program), which has no authorization limit on the dollar amount and no expiration date. There were no share repurchases of common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased 0 and 152 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of $0 and $25, respectively. Dividends per share declared and total dividends paid to Clorox stockholders were as follows for the periods indicated:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Dividends per share declared $ 1.18  $ 1.16  $ 3.54  $ 2.32  Total dividends paid 146  143  291  285  Venture Agreement The Company has a venture agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, P&G had a 20% interest in the venture. Upon termination of the agreement, the Company is required to purchase P&G’s 20% interest for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. The Company performed a valuation of the Glad bags and wraps business as of December 31, 2022, in connection with an update of the Company’s financial projections in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest in the venture was $527 and $635, respectively, of which $489 and $468, respectively, has been recognized and is reflected in Other liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The $108 decrease in the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest since June 30, 2022 was attributable to an increase in the discount rate and a decrease in the estimated future cash flows since the prior valuation. Changes in the judgments, assumptions and market factors used could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&G’s interest, is charged to Cost of products sold in accordance over the remaining life of the agreement. CONTINGENCIES See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company’s contingencies. 28 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently issued accounting standards relevant to the Company.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, a different financial presentation could result depending on the judgments, estimates or assumptions that are used. The most critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require the Company to make the most difficult and subjective judgments, often estimating the outcome of future events that are inherently uncertain. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no significant changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the preparation of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, except as noted below: Goodwill
The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter unless there are indications during a different interim period that these assets may have become impaired. The results of the fiscal year 2022 annual impairment review indicated that the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) reporting unit had a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates or market factors unfavorably change in the future. No triggering events were identified in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the VMS reporting unit below its carrying value through December 31, 2022. As a result of the ongoing heightened risk of future impairments, the Company continues to closely monitor any events, circumstances or changes in this business that might imply a reduction in the estimated fair value and may lead to additional goodwill impairment. Venture Agreement Terminal Obligation The Company performed a valuation of the Glad bags and wraps business as of December 31, 2022 in connection with an update of the Company’s financial projections in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest in the venture was $527 and $635, respectively. Of this estimated fair value $489 and $468 has been recognized and is reflected in Other liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Venture Agreement. Fair value determination requires significant judgment, assumptions and market factors which are uncertain and subject to change. Changes in the judgments, assumptions and market factors used could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. For perspective, if the discount rate as of December 31, 2022 were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest would decrease by approximately $54 or increase by approximately $69, respectively. Such changes would affect the amount of future charges to Cost of products sold. 29 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this MD&A and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors are described below. These measures should be considered supplemental in nature and are not intended to be a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be the same as similarly named measures presented by other companies. Organic sales growth / (decrease)
is defined as net sales growth / (decrease) excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and any acquisitions and divestitures. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth / (decrease) is useful to investors because it excludes sales from any acquisitions and divestitures, which results in a comparison of sales only from the businesses that the Company was operating and expects to continue to operate throughout the relevant periods, and the Company’s estimate of the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, which are difficult to predict and out of the control of the Company and management. The following table provides a reconciliation of organic sales growth / (decrease) (non-GAAP) to net sales growth / (decrease) (GAAP), the most comparable GAAP measure: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Percentage change versus the year-ago period Health and Wellness Household Lifestyle International Total Net sales growth / (decrease) (GAAP) (2) % 9  % 2  % (3) % 1  % Add: Foreign Exchange —  —  —  12  3  Add/(Subtract): Divestitures/Acquisitions —  —  —  —  —  Organic sales growth / (decrease) (non-GAAP) (2) % 9  % 2  % 9  % 4  % Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Percentage change versus the year-ago period Health and Wellness Household Lifestyle International Total Net sales growth / (decrease) (GAAP) (3) % 2  % —  % (2) % (1) % Add: Foreign Exchange —  —  —  11  2  Add/(Subtract): Divestitures/Acquisitions —  —  —  —  —  Organic sales growth / (decrease) (non-GAAP) (3) % 2  % —  % 9  % 1  % 30 Cautionary Statement This Report, including the exhibits hereto and the information incorporated by reference herein, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, among others, statements related to the expected or potential impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the related responses of governments, consumers, customers, suppliers, employees and the Company, on our business, operations, employees, financial condition and results of operations, and any such forward-looking statements, whether concerning the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties.
