FOR
QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2022
NOTE
1
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Quality
Online Education Group Inc. (QOEG) is a leading E-learning company which provides comprehensive online lessons
to students in different parts of the world. It locates in Toronto of Canada and has one wholly
owned subsidiary company: Golden Bridge Human Resources Consulting Inc., an Ontario, Canada, based company provides

services, courseware development and Education-technology platform development.
NOTE
2
GOING CONCERN
The
Company’s ability to continue operating as a “going concern” is dependent on its ability to increase revenues and
raise sufficient additional working capital. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company plans to raise additional capital as needed. There can be
no assurance that this capital will be available and if is not, the Company may be forced to substantially curtail or cease
operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
NOTE
3
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of Consolidation :
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QOEG and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates :
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Financial Statements
in U.S. dollars :
The
reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar (“dollar”). The dollar is the functional currency of the Company
and the Company’s U.S. subsidiary. The financial statements of the non-US subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using
the methods mandated by ASC 830.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents :
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments originally purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
These financial statements have not been subjected to an audit or review or compilation engagement, and no assurance is provided
on them.
Revenue
Recognition :
The
Company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services rendered, the
sales price of fee is fixed or determinable, and its collectability is reasonably assured.
7
Stock
based compensation :
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the ASC 718 “Shares-Based Compensation” FASB Accounting
Standards Classification using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received
for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value
of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of
the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
Foreign
Currency :
The
Company translates the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the local (functional) currencies to U.S. dollars.
The rates of exchange at each fiscal year end are used for translating the assets and liabilities and the average monthly rates
of exchange for each year are used for the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Gains or losses resulting
from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements are included in the accompany consolidated balance
sheets as a separate component of stockholder’s equity.
NOTE
4:
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY COMMON STOCK
After
the acquisition and merger on Aug 31,2020, the management had canceled the original common stock of the Company and authorized new share
capital. It consists of
50,000,000
shares of common stock of which
39,129,789
shares were outstanding as of Aug 31, 2020 and
3,581,517
were free trading. On October 7, 2020, the Company announced to increase the number of authorized common shares to
5,000,000,000 , up
to 3 billion of which will be reserved in order to enact the Merger Agreement. The remainder of the increase will be reserved to fund
potential new product line development, market expansion, and any further mergers and acquisitions as such opportunities arise. At the
same time, an exchangeable shares structure will be used to finalize the current acquisition of QOEG.
Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement dated Aug 31, 2020, ADGS Advisory, Inc. (previous name before name change in May 2021) and QOEG
started to exchange shares. As of Nov 30, 2022, there were
1,207,885,627
QOEG exchangeable shares that have not been exchanged to
QOEG common shares. QOEG has
5,000,000,000
common shares and
20,000,000
preferred shares authorized. Among those shares,
1,751,403,669
QOEG common shares and
1,000,000
QOEG preferred shares were issued and outstanding.
NOTE
5:
INCOME TAXES
The
net operating loss carryovers may be subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code due to significant changes in the Company’s
ownership. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the full amount of the net operating loss benefit, since, in the
opinion of management, based upon the earnings history of the Company it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized.
NOTE
6:
LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDERS
In
support of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from shareholders until such time that the Company
can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal
written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities.
The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. The loans are payable on demand, unsecured
and bears no interest.
NOTE
7:
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The
Company has entered into a service contract with Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd as one of the outsourcing vendors
on global online market research, education consulting and information technology consulting service in September 2021 for three
years. The Company is not aware of any litigation incidental to the conduct of our business as of Nov 30, 2022.

The

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Plan of Operations
Going
Concern
Our financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this offering circular have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability
to raise additional capital as required. For the quarter ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred net losses of ($716,497).
Initially, we intend to finance our operations through equity financings.
Our auditors have indicated that these conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty.
There
are no external sources of liquidity.
Financings
and Securities Offerings
Investing
Activities.
Since
inception, our principal sources of operating funds have been proceeds from equity financing including the sale of our Common Stock to
initial investors known to management and principal shareholders of the Company. We do not expect that our current cash on hand will
fund our existing operations. We will need to raise additional capital in order execute our business plan and growth goals for at least
the next twelve-month period thereafter. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to execute a slower
than planned growth path, reduce overhead and scale back its business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further
operational expansion and growth. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.

Business
Strategy
Quality
Online Education Group has founded in Aug 2018 in Ontario Canada with a global reach. We provide comprehensive online English lessons
to students around the world. English education resource is unbalanced between areas. To address this unmet need, we have developed online
and mobile education platforms, customized the content and optimized the marketing method to provide high quality yet affordable products
that enable students around the world to take live online English lessons with native English-speaking teachers. We connect our students
with highly qualified teachers who have gone through our rigorous selection and training process before they deliver lessons. We hire,
train, and manage our tutors from North America and the Philippines.
Our
market consists of students from K12 to adults. The lessons we provide are focused on the interaction and application of English.
We
have successfully launched a direct selling model through Mommy Influencer in different part of Southeast Asia countries. This business
model is cost-effective, saving us significant sales and marketing dollars and build a better cash flow outlook compared to the competitors
who only use online advertisement. With the proper expansion of operations, coupled with the replication of our direct selling model
to targeted areas around the world more than 200 cities around the globe, we expect to achieve magnitudes of exponential growth.
Company’s
Plan of Operation.
We
are launching small group lessons, where one teacher simultaneously teaches 2-4 students online. The one-to-many model has a lower unit
price than other competitors, and may be affordable for more students yet yield a higher margin.
We
intend to further develop our sales platform by entering additional cities in Southeast Asia and other countries in need of English teaching
resources. Also, we plan to develop and launch new product lines such as the test preparation training for IELTS and non-English types.
Our current student base covers Japan, Thailand, France and Germany. We anticipate a more significant profit margin through increasing
the student retention rate and launching new product lines, like group lessons.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As
a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called
for by Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures
to be ineffective as of November 30, 2022, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that
it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d- 15 (f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company.
Our
internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our CEO, or the persons performing
similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies.
Due
to our limited resources, the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at November
30, 2022:
● we
do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over
financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
● we
do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
and early stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible;
however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals;
● we
do not have an independent audit committee of our Board of Directors;
We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily related, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems.
11
If
and when our financial resources allow, we plan to take a number of actions to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited
to, establishing an audit committee of our Board of Directors comprised of three independent directors, adding experienced accounting
and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls and recommend improvements.
It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
Evaluation
of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
