In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “expects”, “plans”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements. The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the Company’s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, product demand, market and customer acceptance, competition, public health crises, pricing and development difficulties, as well as general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic conditions, and other factors over which we have little or no control; and other factors discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).   Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management’s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.     3 Table of Contents    PART I.

$ 679     $ 5,231     See accompanying notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.     F-4 Table of Contents   Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation   Description of the Company   FairWind Energy, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on April 18, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  Effective June 17, 2019, the Company changed its name to Agentix Corp. In March 2022, the Company changed its fiscal year end from August to March.   The Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutic agents for the treatment of metabolic disease like Type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Going Concern   The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.   As reflected in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit on December 31, 2022 and a net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Cash on hand as of December 31, 2022 was $ 679 .   The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations and it will need further funding. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds.   The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, GSL Healthcare, Inc., AB Merger LLC, Agentix Australia Pty Ltd, and Applied Biopharma, all 100% owned entities. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.     F-5 Table of Contents   Note 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the reporting period ended March 31, 2022 and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-KT.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:   Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.   The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s equity investments are considered Level 3, as pricing inputs are generally unobservable and not corroborated by market data.     F-6 Table of Contents   Commitment and Contingencies   The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.   If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.   Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.   Foreign Currency   Assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency using the exchange rates in effect on the consolidated balance sheet dates. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates, except for the change in retained earnings during the year, which is the result of the income statement translation process. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate during the period. The cumulative translation adjustments associated with the net assets of foreign subsidiaries are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ deficit. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2,225. We did not incur any foreign currency translation adjustments in the same period ended December 31, 2022.
Research and Development   The Company follows paragraph 730-10-25-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2  “Accounting for Research and Development Costs” ) and paragraph 730-20-25-11 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 68  “Research and Development Arrangements” ) for research and development costs. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of remuneration for material and testing costs for research and development.   Related Parties   The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.   Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates (“Affiliate” means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company; b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.     F-7 Table of Contents   The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.   Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision   The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.   Earnings per Share   Earnings per share (“EPS”) are the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.     F-8 Table of Contents   Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260–10–55–23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.   There were no dilutive common shares for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Stock-Based Payments   Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.   For non-employees, the Company follows ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Under the ASU No. 2017-07, most of the guidance on stock payments to nonemployees is aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. As such, most of the guidance in ASC 718 associated with employee share-based payments, including most requirements related to classification and measurement, applies to nonemployee share-based payment arrangements.
No stock options or warrants were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-KT for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.     F-9 Table of Contents   Note 3 – Related Parties   SBS Management LLC   During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $ 112,500

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Agentix Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and development stage company, and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the March 31, 2022 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Form 10-KT (File No. 000-55383; the “Form 10-KT”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, 2022. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute “forward-looking” statements.   Company Overview   We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 18, 2013 and we initially established a fiscal year end of August 31. In March 2022, we changed our year end to March 31.   COVID-19   We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and our Company and have concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of our operations, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this filing. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results:   Basis of Accounting   Our financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and with the rules and regulations of the SEC to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the reporting period ended March 31, 2022, as filed on July 18, 2022, and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-KT.     4 Table of Contents   Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision   We account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.   We adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flow.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021:   We recorded no revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   For the three months ended December 31, 2022, professional fees were $139,821 as compared to $106,266 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in professional fees mainly related to the non-cash issuance of shares for services previously provided offset somewhat by lower consulting fees incurred.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred total research and development expenses of $192,032 as compared to $65,375 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly related to the non-cash issuance of shares for services previously provided along with higher consulting fees during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to same period in 2021.   For the three months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $21,785 as compared to $15,335 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily related to a license fee, which we did not have a similar expense during our three months ended December 31, 2021.
5 Table of Contents   Nine months Ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Nine months Ended December 31, 2021:   We recorded no revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and $1,240 of revenue during our nine months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin related to our sales incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $679.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, professional fees were $296,673 as compared to $309,034 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in professional fees mainly related to lower consulting fees incurred offset somewhat by the issuance of non-cash shares for services previously provided.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred total research and development expenses of $527,676 as compared to $219,362 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly related to patent filing costs that we incurred related to our development efforts along with the non-cash issuance of shares for services previously provided and higher consulting fees during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to same period in 2021.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $118,273 as compared to $46,464 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily related to a license fee, which we did not have a similar expense during our nine months ended December 31, 2021, and higher subscription fees.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit, we did not incur any revenue and we had a net loss along with negative cash generated from our operations. In addition, we owe our vendors and related parties $1,974,545 as of December 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We are attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position is not sufficient to support our daily operations. As such, we will need to raise funds to complete our plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses for the next 12 months. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or debt financing. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company and if we obtain debt financing, the terms of any such debt financing may not be favorable to existing shareholders. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or obtaining debt to fund our development activities and ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our development to complete our plan of operation and our business will fail.     6 Table of Contents   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders   Subsequent Events
In February 2023, we entered into a one-year marketing subscription agreement in exchange for $32,000. The price of the marketing subscription agreement is to be paid through the issuance of our shares of common stock. The price per share, as defined in the agreement, is to be the closing or last-traded price of our common stock on the Effective Date of the agreement, which is February 13, 2023. The shares will be valued for accounting purposes based on the market closing price as of the effective date of the agreement.    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our Secretary and Treasurer, who acts as both our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.   There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.     7 Table of Contents   PART II.
