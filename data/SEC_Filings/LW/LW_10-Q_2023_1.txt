Table of Contents Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement s (Unaudited) ​ 1.    NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Lamb Weston”), along with our joint ventures, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products and is headquartered in Eagle, Idaho. We have
four
reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. See Note 13, Segments, for additional information on our reportable segments. ​ Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements present the financial results of Lamb Weston for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (“U.S”).
​ These consolidated financial statements are unaudited, and include all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements and consist only of normal recurring adjustments. The preparation of financial statements involves the use of estimates and accruals. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from those estimates. Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for our full fiscal year, which ends the last Sunday in May.
​ These financial statements and related condensed notes should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”), where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates. We filed the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2022. ​ There were no accounting pronouncements recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 8
Table of Contents 2.    EARNINGS PER SHARE ​ The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the periods presented:
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Thirteen Weeks Ended ​ Twenty-Six Weeks Ended ​ November 27,      November 28,      November 27,      November 28, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 ​ 2021 ​ 2022 ​ 2021 Numerator: ​      ​      ​      ​    Net income $

0.43 Diluted $
0.71 ​ $
0.22 ​ $
2.32 ​ $
0.42 (a) Potential dilutive shares of common stock under employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and performance awards. As of November 27, 2022,
0.6
million shares of stock-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be antidilutive. As of November 28, 2021,
0.3
million shares of stock-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be antidilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ 3.    INCOME TAXES ​ Income tax expense was $ 36.8
million and $ 9.6
million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, respectively; and $ 110.5
million and $ 18.3
million for the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was
26.3 % and
22.8 % for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, respectively; and
24.8 % and
22.7 % for the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory tax rate of
21 % principally due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, foreign taxes, permanent differences, and discrete items. Excluding the impact of the following items, our effective tax rate was
25.9 % and
25.5 % for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022, respectively: ​ ● Gain associated with the acquisition of an additional
40 %

​ Consolidated Joint Venture ​ In
July 2022 , we acquired an additional
40 % interest in LWAMSA, which increased our total ownership from
50 % to
90 %. We recorded LWAMSA’s assets and liabilities at fair value, which included remeasuring our previously held equity interest at fair value, and for the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022, we recognized a $ 15.1
million gain in “Equity method investment earnings” in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fair value was determined utilizing industry EBITDA multiples and control premium comparable information, which are unobservable inputs, or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We recorded the preliminary fair values as of the date of acquisition. ​ In connection with the purchase of the additional interest in LWAMSA, we ceased equity method accounting and began consolidating LWAMSA’s financial statements. The net sales, income from operations, and total assets acquired were not material to our consolidated net sales, income from operations, and total assets. LWAMSA’s operating results are included in our Global segment. ​ 10
Table of Contents In September 2022, we announced an expansion of french fry processing capacity in Argentina with the planned construction of a new manufacturing facility in Mar del Plata. The new processing facility is expected to produce more than
200
million pounds of frozen french fries and other potato products per year. Construction of the new line is expected to be completed in fiscal 2025. The total investment is expected to be approximately $ 240
million. This investment will add to the capacity produced at LWAMSA’s existing production facility in Buenos Aires. ​ Noncontrolling Interest (“NCI”) ​ As of November 27, 2022, total LWAMSA interest not directly attributable to Lamb Weston, or NCI, was $ 8.1
million and was recorded in “Additional distributed capital” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022, the net loss attributable to NCI was not significant and was recorded in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ​ Unconsolidated Joint Ventures ​ Our equity method investments were as follows:

and began consolidating the joint venture. ​ ​ In September 2022, LWM completed the previously announced withdrawal from its joint venture in Russia. In October 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in LWM for consideration consisting of € 525.0
million in cash and € 175.0
million in shares of our common stock. The number of shares of our common stock to be paid will be equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of € 175.0
million, valued at the volume weighted average of the trading price per share of our common stock for the
five
trading days immediately preceding the signing date of the agreement and the
five
trading days immediately preceding the closing date of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, we will own
100 % of LWM. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Following closing of the transaction, we will include LWM’s operating results in our Global segment. ​ ​ 11

​ The Compensation and Human Capital Committee (“the Committee”) of our Board of Directors administers our stock compensation plan. The Committee, in its discretion, authorizes grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance awards payable upon the attainment of specified performance goals (“Performance Shares”), stock options, dividend equivalents, and other stock-based awards. As of November 27, 2022,
6.0
million shares were available for future grant under the plan. ​
​ ​ RSUs ​ We grant RSUs to eligible employees and non-employee directors. The employee RSUs generally vest over a
three-year
period following the grant date, while the non-employee director RSUs generally vest
one year
after the grant date. We estimate the fair value of the RSUs based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
13
Table of Contents Compensation expense is recognized over the period the employee or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award. ​ Performance Shares ​ Performance Shares are granted to certain executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. Awards actually earned range from  0 %
to  200 %
of the targeted number of Performance Shares for each of the performance periods. Awards, if earned, would be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our stock plan, any shares earned will generally vest over a  three-year  service period following the grant date. The value of these Performance Shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and the anticipated attainment of Company-wide performance goals at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the service period. ​ We have also granted Performance Shares with vesting contingent upon relative total shareholder return goals, and, under special circumstances, stock price growth goals. Awards actually earned range from
0 %
to
200 % , in the case of awards contingent on total shareholder return goals, or
0 %
to
300 % , in the case of awards contingent on stock price growth goals, of the targeted number of Performance Shares. These Performance Shares are equity-settled awards that vest over a
three-year
service period following the grant date, and the number of units that actually vest is determined based on the achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the respective award agreement. The awards are measured based on estimated fair value as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, and are amortized over the service period. ​ The weighted average Monte Carlo assumptions for Performance Shares granted during the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022 were: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assumptions Dividend yield (%) ​ ​ 0.00
-
1.42 Expected volatility of stock (%) ​ ​

2.89 Expected life (years) ​ ​
2.82 Weighted average grant date fair value per unit ​ $ 91.43
- $ 118.97 ​
Stock Options ​ Under special circumstances, we have granted options to employees and non-employee directors for the purchase of stock at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. Options granted to employees generally become exercisable in
three
annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of
seven years . Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest
one year
after the grant date and have a term of
ten years . ​ The weighted average Black-Scholes assumptions for stock options granted during the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2022 were: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assumptions Weighted average fair value ​ $ 25.90

( 14.6 ) ​ (a) Derivative assets included in Level 2 primarily represent commodity swaps, option contracts, and currency contracts. The fair values of our Level 2 derivative assets were determined using valuation models that use market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for commodities.
Derivative assets are presented within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ​ (b) The fair values of our Level 2 deferred compensation liabilities were valued using third-party valuations, which are based on the net asset values of mutual funds in our retirement plans. While the underlying assets are actively traded on an exchange, the funds are not. Deferred compensation liabilities are primarily presented within “Other noncurrent liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ​ ​ At November 27, 2022, we had $ 2,170.0
million of fixed-rate and $ 588.0
million of variable-rate debt outstanding. Based on current market rates, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt was estimated to be $ 1,944.7
million. Any differences between the book value and fair value are due to the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate debt. The fair value of our variable-rate term debt approximates the carrying amount as our cost of borrowing is variable and approximates current market prices. ​ 12.   STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY ​ Share Repurchase Program ​ Our Board of Directors authorized a program, with no expiration date, to repurchase up to $ 500.0

Table of Contents Overview
​ Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Lamb Weston”), along with our joint ventures, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We, along with our joint ventures, are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America and a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We, along with our joint ventures, offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio. ​ This MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and related condensed notes included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and certain other financial data (including product contribution margin, on a consolidated basis, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS) that is prepared using non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for the definitions of product contribution margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to gross profit, income from operations, net income, or diluted earnings per share, as applicable.
​ Executive Summary ​ The following highlights our financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the prior year quarter. For more information, refer to the “Results of Operations” section below. ​ ● Net sales increased 27% to $1,276.5 million ● Income from operations increased 138% to $271.8 million ● Net income increased 217% to $103.1 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 223% to $0.71, including items impacting comparability, as discussed below, of $110.3 million ($82.3 million after-tax, or $0.57 per share) ● Adjusted Income from Operations increased 114% to $245.3 million ● Adjusted Net Income increased 171% to $185.4 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS increased 172% to $1.28 ● Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 92% to $334.6 million ● We returned $35.2 million of cash to stockholders through dividends ​ We drove strong sales growth, earnings growth, and gross margin expansion in the quarter by continuing to execute pricing actions across each of our business segments to counter significant input, manufacturing, and supply chain cost inflation. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in sales volume, primarily reflecting an inability to fully serve customer demand in our foodservice and retail channels due to the impact of supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities, and to a lesser extent, softer restaurant traffic and demand trends in the U.S., especially at casual dining and full-service restaurants, as consumers adjusted to the severe inflationary environment. Overall traffic at large quick service restaurants (“QSR”) in the U.S. remained solid.
​ The increase in net income was driven by higher sales and gross profit and lower interest expense, and was partially offset by sharply lower equity method investment earnings and higher selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). The following items impacted comparability of our second quarter results and were excluded when providing Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures: ​ ● Interest expense in the prior year quarter included a loss of $53.3 million ($40.5 million after-tax, or $0.28 per share) associated with the extinguishment of debt (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). ​ ● The decrease in equity method investment earnings included a $136.8 million unrealized loss ($101.5 million after-tax, or $0.70 per share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 related to mark-to-market adjustments associated

Table of Contents with natural gas and electricity hedging contracts in Europe, reflecting the volatility of those energy markets in that region, and a $6.3 million unrealized gain ($4.7 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) in the prior year quarter.
​ ● SG&A included a net $26.5 million gain ($19.2 million after-tax, or $0.13 per share), related to actions taken to mitigate the effect of changes in currency rates on the pending purchase of the remaining ownership interest in LWM, net of other
acquisition-related costs.
​ In October 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in LWM for consideration consisting of €525.0 million in cash and €175.0 million in shares of our common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, we will own 100% of LWM. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals. After closing, we will include LWM’s operating results within our Global segment. ​ Outlook ​ During the second half of fiscal 2023, we expect increases in price/mix in each of our core business segments to be the primary driver of net sales growth versus the prior year period. We expect supply chain disruptions, including the effects of commodities shortages and onboarding new production workers, and changes in product mix will continue to impact run-rates and throughput in our production facilities, and affect our customer fulfillment rates. We also expect sales volume trends and demand will continue to be volatile as consumers in the U.S. and our key international markets continue to respond to the current inflationary environment. We expect our gross margins will be largely consistent with the levels that we delivered in the first half of the year due to the carryover benefits of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022, as well as actions being taken in fiscal 2023 to offset input cost inflation, including an increase in raw potato costs as a result of higher contract rates and the impact of below-average crop yields as a result of significant heat waves late in the season in our growing regions in the Pacific Northwest. We expect LWM’s earnings may improve as compared to the prior year period as a result of the continued implementation of pricing actions to counter cost inflation. ​ While the near-term global demand trends may be volatile as consumers navigate the current challenging macroenvironment, our investments to expand capacity in Idaho, China, and Argentina, along with our intent to acquire the remaining equity interest in our LWM joint venture, reflect our belief in the long-term health and growth outlook of the frozen potato category. ​ Results of Operations
​ We have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. We report net sales and product contribution margin by segment and on a consolidated basis. Product contribution margin, when presented on a consolidated basis, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion (“A&P”) expenses. Product contribution margin includes A&P expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of the Company’s segments. Net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. For additional information on our reportable segments and product contribution margin, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and Note 13, Segments, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.

​ Net Sales ​ Compared to the prior year quarter, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $269.9 million, or 27%, to $1,276.5 million. Price/mix increased 30%, reflecting the benefit of pricing actions across each of our core business segments to counter input, manufacturing, and transportation cost inflation. Volume declined 3%, primarily reflecting an inability to fully serve customer demand in our foodservice and retail channels. The impact of supply chain disruptions during the quarter, including the effects of commodities shortages and onboarding new production workers, continued to affect production run-rates and throughput in our production facilities as well as customer order fulfillment rates. To a lesser extent, softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the U.S. also contributed to the decline as consumers face a challenging macroeconomic environment. ​ Global segment net sales increased $176.1 million, or 34%, to $692.8 million. Price/mix increased 31% and volume increased 3%. The benefit of domestic and international product and freight pricing actions to offset inflation, as well as favorable mix, drove the increase in price/mix. The impact of acquiring a controlling interest in Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos S.A. (“LWAMSA”) in early fiscal 2023, growth in international shipments, and strength in domestic QSR limited time product offerings largely drove the increase in volume. ​ Foodservice segment net sales increased $44.0 million, or 14%, to $357.9 million. Price/mix increased 25%, while volume decreased 11%. The carryover benefits of product and freight pricing actions taken in the prior year, as well as actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation, drove the increase in price/mix. Volume fell, reflecting a combination of: the supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities; incremental losses of certain low-margin business; and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in restaurant traffic and consumer demand in casual dining and other full-service restaurants. ​ Retail segment net sales increased $48.9 million, or 34%, to $191.5 million. Price/mix increased 43%, while volume decreased 9%. The carryover benefits of product and freight pricing actions across the branded and private label portfolios taken in the prior year, as well as actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation, drove the increase in price/mix. While consumer demand for frozen potato products remained strong, volume fell largely due to the impact of supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities, as well as incremental losses of certain low-margin, private label business. 23
Table of Contents ​ Other segment net sales increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $34.3 million. Price/mix increased 5% and was driven by higher prices in our vegetable business. Volume decreased 2%, reflecting the negative effect of the extreme summer heat on the yield and quality of the vegetable crops. ​ Gross Profit and Product Contribution Margin ​ Gross profit increased $176.1 million, or 86%, to $381.6 million, as benefits from pricing actions more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing and distribution costs on a per-pound basis, as well as lower sales volumes. The higher costs per pound primarily reflected double-digit cost inflation from key inputs, including: edible oils, ingredients such as grains and starches used in product coatings, labor, and transportation and warehousing. The increase in costs per pound also reflected higher costs associated with the impact of extreme summer heat that negatively affected the yield and quality of potato crops in the Pacific Northwest in fall 2021, as well as the effects of supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities. The increase in gross profit also included a $6.5 million increase in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts, which includes a $0.4 million gain in the second quarter, compared with a $6.1 million loss related to these items in the prior year quarter. ​ Our overall product contribution margin, defined as gross profit less A&P expenses, increased $174.5 million, or 87%, to $375.0 million. The increase was largely driven by higher sales and gross profit (as described above). ​ Global segment product contribution margin increased $90.1 million, or 111%, to $171.0 million. Pricing actions and favorable mix drove the increase, more than offsetting higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound. As a result of the cumulative benefit of pricing actions and mix improvement efforts during the past two years to counter input cost inflation, the Global segment’s product contribution margin percentage in the second quarter approached pre-pandemic levels. Global segment cost of sales was $520.5 million, up 20% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs, as well as higher sales volumes. ​ Foodservice segment product contribution margin increased $26.4 million, or 25%, to $130.8 million. Pricing actions drove the increase, and was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound, unfavorable mix, and the impact of lower sales volumes. Foodservice segment cost of sales was $225.4 million, up 8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes. ​ Retail segment product contribution margin increased $44.3 million, or 207%, to $65.7 million. Pricing actions drove the increase, partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound. Retail segment cost of sales was $122.2 million, a 3% increase compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes. ​ Other segment product contribution margin increased $13.7 million to $7.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to a loss of $6.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. These amounts include a $2.0 million gain and an $8.6 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts reported in the Other segment in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding these mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements, Other segment product contribution margin increased $3.1 million, largely due to pricing actions in our vegetable business. ​ Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
​ SG&A increased $18.7 million to $109.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and includes a net $26.5 million gain ($19.2 million after-tax, or $0.13 per share) related to actions taken to mitigate the effect of changes in currency rates on the pending purchase of the remaining ownership interest in LWM, net of other
acquisition-related costs.
Excluding items impacting comparability, SG&A increased $45.2 million to $136.3 million,
primarily due
to higher compensation and benefits expense, and to a lesser extent, higher expenses related to improving our information systems and ERP infrastructure. ​ 24
Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net
​ Compared with the prior year quarter, interest expense, net decreased $57.8 million to $24.6 million, primarily reflecting a loss on extinguishment of debt in the prior year quarter of $53.3 million ($40.5 million after-tax, or $0.28 per share) associated with the redemption in full of our outstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In addition, capitalized interest and interest income were each higher versus the prior year quarter. ​ Income Tax Expense ​ Income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $36.8 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 26.3% and 22.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 25.9% and 23.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, principally due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, foreign taxes, permanent differences, and discrete items.
​ Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) ​ We conduct business through unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe and the U.S. and include our share of the earnings (loss) based on our economic ownership interest in them. Our share of earnings and loss from our equity method investments was a loss of $107.3 million and earnings of $10.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity method investment earnings (loss) included a $130.1 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, of which $136.8 million ($101.5 million after-tax, or $0.70 per share) related to losses in natural gas and electricity derivatives as commodity markets in Europe have experienced significant volatility. Equity method investment earnings in the prior year quarter included a $3.6 million unrealized gain for mark-to-market adjustments, of which $6.3 million ($4.7 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) related to gains in natural gas and electricity derivatives.
​ Excluding the items impacting comparability noted above (mark-to-market adjustments related to natural gas and electricity derivatives) and the other mark-to-market adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $16.3 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting favorable price/mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs, in both Europe and the U.S. ​ 25

The carryover benefits of product and freight pricing actions across the branded and private label portfolios taken in the prior year, as well as actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation, largely drove the increase in price/mix. While consumer demand for frozen potato products remained strong, the decline in the segment’s overall volume was due largely to the impact of supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities for branded products, as well as incremental losses of certain low-margin, private label business. ​ Other segment net sales increased $1.8 million, or 3%, to $64.3 million. Price/mix increased 8% and was driven by higher prices in our vegetable business. Volume decreased 5%, reflecting the negative effect of the extreme summer heat on the yield and quality of the vegetable crops. ​ Gross Profit and Product Contribution Margin ​ Gross profit increased $298.1 million, or 84%, to $654.9 million, as benefits from pricing actions more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing and distribution costs on a per-pound basis, as well as lower sales volumes. The higher costs per pound predominantly reflected double-digit cost inflation from key inputs, including: edible oils; ingredients, such as grains and starches used in product coatings; transportation; and labor. The increase in costs per pound also reflected higher costs associated with the impact of extreme summer heat that negatively affected the yield and quality of potato crops in the Pacific Northwest in fall 2021, as well as the effects of supply chain disruptions on run-rates and throughput in our production facilities. The increase in per pound costs was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings. ​ Our overall product contribution margin increased $296.1 million, or 85%, to $643.8 million. The increase was largely due to higher sales and gross profit (as described above). ​ Global segment product contribution margin increased $131.2 million, or 106%, to $254.7 million. Pricing actions drove the increase, more than offsetting higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound, as well as unfavorable mix. Global segment cost of sales was $995.6 million, up 12% compared to the first half of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs. ​ Foodservice segment product contribution margin increased $68.3 million, or 34%, to $269.1 million.

​ SG&A increased $43.9 million to $226.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2023, and includes a net $26.5 million gain ($19.2 million after-tax, or $0.13 per share) related to actions taken to mitigate the effect of changes in currency rates on the pending purchase of the remaining ownership interest in LWM, net of other
acquisition-related costs.
Excluding items impacting comparability, SG&A increased $70.4 million to $252.6 million,
primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, and higher expenses related to improving our information systems and ERP infrastructure. ​ 27
Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net
​ Compared with the first half of fiscal 2022, interest expense, net decreased $59.7 million to $50.6 million. The first half of fiscal year 2022 includes a $53.3 million ($40.5 million after-tax or $0.28 per share) loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption in full of our 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. ​ Income Tax Expense ​ Income tax expense for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $110.5 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 24.8% and 22.7% for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 25.5% and 23.0%. The effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, principally due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, foreign taxes, permanent differences, and discrete items.
​ Equity Method Investment Earnings
​ Equity method investments earnings were $67.3 million and $16.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity method investment earnings included a $14.4 million unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the first half of fiscal 2023, of which $9.5 million ($7.0 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share) related to gains in natural gas and electricity derivatives as commodity markets in Europe have experienced significant volatility. Equity method investment earnings in the first half of fiscal 2022 included a $7.9 million unrealized gain for mark-to-market adjustments, of which $11.3 million ($8.4 million after-tax, or $0.06 per share) related to gains in natural gas and electricity derivatives. Equity method investment earnings in the first half of fiscal 2023 also included a $15.1 million gain (before and after-tax, or $0.10 per share) recognized in connection with remeasuring our previously held 50% ownership interest in LWAMSA to fair value.
​ Excluding the items impacting comparability noted above (mark-to-market adjustments related to natural gas and electricity derivatives and the remeasurement of our previously held ownership interest in LWAMSA) and the other mark-to-market adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $29.4 million compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable price/mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs, in both Europe and the U.S. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources ​ Sources and Uses of Cash ​ We ended the first half of fiscal 2023 with $419.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $994.6 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit. As of November 27, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
​ In October 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in LWM for consideration consisting of €525.0 million in cash and €175.0 million in shares of our common stock. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals. We expect to fund the cash portion of this acquisition with new borrowings and cash on hand. ​ We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months with current cash balances and cash from operations, and in the longer term, supplemented as necessary by available borrowings under our currently undrawn revolving credit facility.

Table of Contents Cash Flows
​ Below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities:

(161.6) ​ Operating Activities ​ In the first half of fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased $80.5 million to $288.0 million, compared with $207.5 million in the same period a year ago. The increase related to a $128.5 million increase in income from operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expenses, offset by $48.0 million of cash used for unfavorable changes in working capital. See “Results of Operations” in this MD&A for more information related to the increase in income from operations. Unfavorable changes in working capital primarily related to higher-cost finished goods inventories, due primarily to increased potato and input cost inflation. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing, an increase in accrued liabilities due to higher compensation and benefits accrued in fiscal 2023, compared with the prior year period, and an increase in income taxes payable due to higher taxable income in fiscal 2023, compared with the prior year period. ​ Investing Activities ​ Investing activities used $311.0 million of cash in the first half of fiscal 2023, compared with $147.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily relates to our investments in our chopped and formed capacity expansion and our french fry processing line in American Falls, Idaho, and our greenfield french fry processing facility in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, China. We expect to use approximately $475 million to $525 million for capital expenditures, excluding our pending acquisition of LWM and other acquisitions, if any, in fiscal 2023. We also used $42.3 million to acquire an additional ownership interest in our joint venture in Argentina and used $37.4 million to acquire assets associated with the improvement of our information and technology services infrastructure. ​ Financing Activities ​ In the first half of fiscal 2023, cash used for financing activities decreased $122.7 million to $96.6 million, compared with $219.3 million used during the same period a year ago. During the first half of fiscal 2023, financing activities primarily related to $23.3 million of additional borrowings under our RMB-denominated loan facility, offset by $16.7 million of debt and financing obligation repayments, and the payment of $70.6 million of cash dividends to our common stockholders. In addition, we used $34.9 million of cash to repurchase 404,476 shares of our common stock at an average price of $70.11 per share and withheld 82,042 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. ​ In the first half of fiscal 2022, financing activities primarily
related to issuing senior notes, which generated net proceeds of $1,655.4 million, debt and financing obligation repayments of $1,682.1 million, including the redemption of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, the payment of $68.7 million of cash dividends to our common stockholders, and the payment of an aggregate redemption premium of $39.6 million relating to the notes redemption. In addition, $83.5 million related to the repurchase of 1,264,114 shares of our common stock at an average price of $60.15 per share and withholding 114,530 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. 29
Table of Contents ​ For more information about our debt, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report and Note 7, Debt and Financing Obligations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Form 10-K. At November 27, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our credit agreements. ​ Obligations and Commitments
​ Except for our pending acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in LWM as discussed in this MD&A, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Form 10-K. ​ Non-GAAP Financial Measures
​ To supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented product contribution margin on a consolidated basis, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. ​ Product contribution margin is one of the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. Product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and A&P expenses. Product contribution margin includes A&P expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of our segments. Our management also uses Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect management’s exclusion of items impacting comparability between periods as management believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating trends of our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as a means to evaluate the underlying performance of our business on an ongoing basis, and we believe these measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide useful supplemental information regarding the factors and trends affecting Lamb Weston’s business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they provide useful information to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing our operating performance and underlying prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures are not a substitute for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit, income from operations, net income, or diluted earnings per share, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way. ​ See “Results of Operations – Thirteen Weeks Ended November 27, 2022 compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended November 28, 2021 – Net Sales, Gross Profit, and Product Contribution Margin” and “Results of Operations – Twenty-Six Weeks Ended November 27, 2022 compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended November 28, 2021 – Net Sales, Gross Profit, and Product Contribution Margin” above for a reconciliation of product contribution margin on a consolidated basis to gross profit. ​ 30

The gain related to the remeasuring of our previously held 50% ownership interest to fair value. ​ 31

​ There have been no material changes to the off-balance sheet arrangements disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Form 10-K. ​ 32
Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
​ A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the Form 10-K. There were no material changes to these critical accounting policies and estimates during the first half of fiscal 2023. ​ New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
​ There were no accounting pronouncements recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For a list of our new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in the Form 10-K. ​ ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ​ Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, we may periodically enter into derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, but not for trading purposes. The disruptions in the global economy caused by the war in Ukraine have resulted in volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate. At the time of this filing, we are unable to predict or determine the impacts that these events may continue to have on our exposure to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates, among other factors. For more information, refer to “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in the Form 10-K. ​ Commodity Price Risk ​ Based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of November 27, 2022, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “Cost of sales” of $5.4 million ($4.1 million after-tax). Additionally, based on our LWM joint venture’s open commodity contract hedge positions as of November 27, 2022, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “Equity method investment earnings (loss)” of $8.5 million ($6.3 million after-tax). Any change in the fair value of these contracts, real or hypothetical, would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item.
​ Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk ​ Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, including the Chinese yuan, and our joint ventures outside the U.S. transact in euros and Argentine pesos. From time to time, we may economically hedge currency risk with foreign currency contracts, such as forward contracts. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of $41.8 million ($31.7 million after-tax) and $6.5 million ($5.0 million after-tax) as of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, respectively. The increased hypothetical risk from May 29, 2022 is primarily related to actions taken to mitigate the effect of changes in currency rates on the pending purchase of the remaining ownership interest in LWM discussed in “Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report. ​ Interest Rate Risk ​ At November 27, 2022, we had $2,170.0 million of fixed-rate and $588.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding. We have interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate debt. A one percent increase in interest rates related to variable-rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of $6.0 million annually ($4.6 million after-tax) at November 27, 2022.

​ ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
​ Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls ​ Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ​ Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures ​ Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of November 27, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. ​ Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting ​ Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 27, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ 34
