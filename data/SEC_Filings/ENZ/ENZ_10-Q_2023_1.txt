NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of January 31, 2023
(UNAUDITED)
(Dollars in thousands, except share data)
Note 1 – Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Enzo Biochem, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Enzo Life Sciences, Enzo Clinical Labs, Enzo Therapeutics, Enzo Realty LLC and
Enzo Realty II LLC, collectively or with one or more of its subsidiaries referred to as the “Company” or “Companies”.
The Company has two reportable segments: Clinical Services and Products. The consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023, the consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive loss and stockholders’ equity for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,
and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 (the “interim statements”)
are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly
the financial position and operating results for the interim periods have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosure, normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”), have been condensed or omitted. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022 and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated balance sheet at July 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial
statements at that date. The results of operations for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2023.
Change in segment reporting
Historically, we engaged in the research and development of therapeutic
candidates through Enzo Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical venture that was developing multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal,
infectious, ophthalmic and metabolic diseases, many of which were derived from the researching work of Enzo Life Sciences. Enzo Therapeutics
focused its efforts on researching treatment regimens for diseases and conditions for which treatment options were ineffective, costly,
and/or caused unwanted side effects. This focus generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as numerous patents and patent
applications with Enzo Therapeutics as the assignee. At the beginning of fiscal 2023, we determined we would redirect our research resources
and efforts to our two operating segments, Enzo Life Sciences and Enzo Clinical Labs, and no longer consider Enzo Therapeutics a segment.
The operating results of Enzo Therapeutics are now included in the “Other” segment. The prior period segment information for
the three and six months ended January 31, 2022 reported in Note 11 has been restated to be included in the “Other” segment.
The operating expenses of Enzo Therapeutics for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 now included in the “Other”
segment were $ 12
and $ 21 , respectively. The operating expenses of Enzo Therapeutics for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022
now included in the “Other” segment were $ 20
and $ 25 , respectively.
Liquidity and Going Concern
During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred
a net loss of $ 21,955
and used cash in operating activities of $ 14,891 . The Company believes that based on its fiscal 2023 forecast, its
current cash and cash equivalents level is not sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next
twelve (12) months, which conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after
the date that the unaudited interim financial statements are issued.
7
In response to these conditions, the Company is evaluating various
financing strategies to obtain sufficient additional liquidity to meet its operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months
following the date of issuance of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Specifically, on March 10, 2023, the Company
signed a commitment letter providing for up to $ 8,000
of a revolving line of credit subject to closing, and as previously disclosed is
exploring various strategic alternatives including the sale of segment operating assets. On March 16, 2023, the Company entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale to Labcorp of substantially all the operating assets and assignment of certain liabilities
which are necessary for Labcorp to operate the business of the Clinical Labs division. See Note 13 Subsequent Events. However, there can
be no assurance that either of these capital raising strategies will be successful, and the Company may need to raise additional capital
during the current fiscal year. The Company also believes it has the ability to raise additional funds, either through additional debt
secured by real property owned, private debt, selling preferred stock, reactivating its Sales Agreement with Cantor, or through other
sources, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise capital pursuant to the foregoing on favorable terms or
at all. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed in connection with the Sales Agreement expired in October 2020 but a new Registration
Statement could be filed at any time at the discretion of the Company, as disclosed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic
conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans. The
unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.
Revolving Line of Credit commitment
On March 10, 2023, the Company entered into a commitment for a one-year
credit facility with an asset based lender specializing in direct lending to middle-market companies in the healthcare sector. The facility
is an $ 8
million revolving line of credit based on the Company’s eligible accounts receivable. The annual interest rate is equal
to the 90 day term SOFR rate plus
5.5 %. The line of credit would terminate one year from closing and unused line fees and early prepayment
penalties apply.
Closing and initial funding are conditioned on the absence of any material
adverse change in the operations or financial condition of the Company prior to the closing date. The Company and the lender are using
their best efforts to close on the line of credit as soon as possible. The expected closing time period is the end of March 2023.
Impact of COVID-19
We made substantial investments to expand and maintain the amount of
COVID-19 testing available in the communities we serve since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. We applied our technical expertise
in molecular diagnostics to develop next generation COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody testing options which were approved under the FDA
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, the Company generated substantial COVID-19 related services
revenues, representing
44 % of all services revenues. This testing had a significantly positive impact on the profitability and cash flow
of our Clinical services segment for most of fiscal 2022. Revenues from COVID-19 testing during the three and six months ended January
31, 2022 represented
56 % and
52 %, respectively of all services revenues. The rate of transmission of COVID-19 and the severity of its
variants have dramatically declined in the US. Revenues from COVID-19 testing during the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 represented
approximately
4 % and
6 %, respectively, of all services revenues.
In March 2022, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration
(“HRSA”) informed providers that, after March 22, 2022, it would stop accepting claims for testing and treatment for uninsured
individuals under the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program and that claims submitted prior to that date would be subject to eligibility and
availability of funds. Although we believe that our estimates for contractual allowances and patient price concessions are appropriate,
actual results could differ from those estimates. If the HRSA receives additional funding, it might again accept claims under the Uninsured
Program.
8
Federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed
to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in, among other things, a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation
of elective medical procedures, and the continuation of work-from-home policies. The COVID-19 impact on the Company’s operations
is consistent with the overall industry and our competitors, partners, and vendors. While we anticipate that COVID-19 will continue to
impact our business into the future, increases in vaccination rates and booster shots, the development of new therapeutics and greater
availability of rapid COVID-19 tests has resulted in a continued, significant decline in demand for our COVID-19 testing. As a result,
volume, revenues, profitability, and cash flow from COVID-19 testing during the current periods were all substantially and materially
lower than the prior year period levels. COVID-19 testing is no longer a material part of our Services business.
We expect volume and revenues from COVID-19 testing will remain less
significant in the periods ahead as the percentage of Americans who are vaccinated increases, the severity of its variants declines, and
the general increase in the use of “at home” testing. However, the emergence and spread of potentially more serious variants
may cause our COVID-19 testing volume to increase again. With respect to our non-COVID-19 operations, even after the COVID-19 pandemic
impact has greatly moderated, we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our businesses, consolidated results of operations,
financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary economic environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve
to increase interest rates.
The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require
consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown
future impacts of COVID-19 and the recessionary economic environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase
interest rates as of January 31, 2023 and through the date of this Quarterly Report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were
not limited to, the Company’s patient self-pay revenue concessions and credit losses in the Clinical Services segment, accounts
receivable, inventories and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude
and duration of COVID-19, as well as other economic factors, could result in additional material adverse impacts to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements
Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments –
Credit Losses (Topic 326). This standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from
an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses.
The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate
considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of this standard is required
for our annual and interim periods beginning August 1, 2023, as we qualified as a smaller reporting company at the end of fiscal 2022
and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this
standard on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and
have concluded they are not applicable or not expected to be significant to the accounting for our operations.

Concentration Risk
Other than the Medicare program, one provider whose programs are included
in the “Third-party payers” and “Health Maintenance Organizations” (“HMO’s”) categories represents
approximately
16 % and
17 % of Clinical Services net revenue for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively and
16 % of
the Clinical Services net accounts receivable as of January 31, 2023. Other than the Medicare program, two providers whose programs are
included in the “Third-party payers” and “Health Maintenance Organizations” (“HMO’s”) categories
represent approximately
36 % and
35 % of Clinical Services net revenue for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. The liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced
by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the benefits may not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.
Under the liability method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Note 2 – Net income (loss) per share
Basic net income (loss) per share represents net income (loss) divided
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As a result of the net loss for the three and six months
ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, diluted weighted average shares outstanding are the same as basic weighted average shares outstanding,
and do not include the potential common shares from stock options, restricted stock units, or unearned performance stock units because
to do so would be antidilutive.
For the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, approximately
60,000
and
83,000 , respectively, of potential common shares from “in the money options” and unvested restricted stock and
performance stock units were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) per share because their effect would be antidilutive.
For the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, approximately
499,000
and
527,000 , respectively, of potential common shares from “in the money options” and unvested performance stock units
were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) per share because their effect would be antidilutive.
10
For the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, the effect of
approximately
4,189,000
and
3,392,000 , respectively, of outstanding “out of the money” options to purchase common shares were
excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and six
months ended January 31, 2022, the effect of
1,091,000
and
942,000 , respectively, of outstanding “out of the money” options
to purchase common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Note 3 – Revenue Recognition
Clinical Services Revenue
The Company accounts for revenue pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 606. Service revenues in the Company’s clinical services business accounted for
54 % and
70 % of the Company’s total revenues
for three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and
58 % and
72 % for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively
and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The services business, which provides clinical testing
services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and
reporting to the ordering physician. The Company may also perform clinical testing services for other laboratories and will recognize
revenue from those services when reported to the ordering laboratory. The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to
receive from customer groups using the portfolio approach. These estimates of the expected consideration include the impact of contractual
allowances and price concessions on our customer group portfolios consisting of healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers
and patients as described below. Contracts with customers in our laboratory services business do not contain a financing component, based
on the typically limited period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration. The transaction price includes
variable consideration in the form of the contractual allowance and price concessions as well as the collectability of the transaction
based on patient intent and ability to pay. The Company uses the expected value method in estimating the amount of the variability included
in the transaction price.
The following are descriptions of our laboratory services business
portfolios:
Third party payers and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO’s)
Reimbursements from third party payers, primarily healthcare insurers
and HMO’s are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates. Revenues consist of amounts billed net
of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such
payers, which considers historical collection and denial experience and the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements. Adjustments
to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the third-party payers, are recorded upon settlement.
Collection of the consideration the Company expects to receive is normally
a function of providing complete and correct billing information to these third party payers within the various filing deadlines, and
typically occurs within 30 to 90 days of billing. Provided the Company has billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information
prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no collection risk. If there has been a delay in billing,
the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, will reserve accordingly for the
billing.
Third-party payers, including government programs, may decide to deny
payment or recoup payments for testing that they contend was improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations,
or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments
already received. Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of these factors among others, including without limitation, differing
interpretations of billing and coding guidance and changes by government agencies and payers in interpretations, requirements, and “conditions
of participation” in various programs.
11
Government Payer - Medicare
Reimbursements from Medicare are based on fee-for-service schedules
set by Medicare, which is funded by the government. Revenues consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between
amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from Medicare, which considers historical collection and
denial experience and other factors. Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the government payers, are recorded
upon settlement.
Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive is normally
a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines and typically occurs within 60
days of billing. Provided the Company has billed the government payer accurately with complete information prior to the established filing
deadline, there has historically been little to no collection risk. If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the
amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, it will reserve accordingly for the billing.
Patient self-pay
Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules
or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Coinsurance and deductible responsibilities based on fees negotiated with
healthcare insurers are also billed to insured patients and included in this portfolio. Collection of billings from patients is subject
to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay. Revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients
in accordance with the Company’s policies and implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between
amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience
and other factors including current market conditions. Adjustments to the estimated allowances, based on actual receipts from the patients,
are recorded upon settlement. Patient responsibility is invoiced and if it reaches 91 days outstanding, the account is sent to a collection
agency for further processing. After the account has been with the collection agency for at least 105 days, it is written off.

Products Revenue
In accordance with ASC 606, the Company generates product revenue from
the sale of our single-use products used in the identification of genomic information. Revenue is recorded net of sales tax. The Company
considers revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met: the Company has a contract with a customer that creates enforceable
rights and obligations; promised products are identified; the transaction price is determinable; and the Company has transferred control
of the promised items to the customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the
customer, and is the unit of account in the contract. The transaction price for the contract is measured as the amount of consideration
the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods expected to be transferred. A contract’s transaction price is allocated
to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the distinct good or service is transferred.
Transfer of control for the Company’s products is generally at shipment or delivery, depending on contractual terms, but occurs
when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which represents the point in time when the customer obtains the use of and substantially
all of the remaining benefit of the product. As such, the Company’s performance obligation related to product sales is satisfied
at a point in time. The Company recognizes a receivable when it has an unconditional right to payment, which represents the amount the
Company expects to collect in a transaction and is most often equal to the transaction price in the contract. Payment terms for shipments
to end-user and distributor customers may range from 30 to 90 days. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included
in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products.

Note 6 – Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets
The Company’s carrying amount of goodwill is in the Clinical
Laboratory Services segment and is $ 7,452
as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.
The Company tests goodwill annually as of the first day of the fourth
quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option
to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it
is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform
any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative
assessment, then it will perform a quantitative assessment as it identifies the reporting units and compares the fair value of each of
these reporting units to their respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no
impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, the impairment charge is the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived
assets (including its intangible assets, all of which have finite lives) of an asset or asset group for impairment annually as of the
end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Should indicators of impairment exist, the carrying
values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of an asset or asset group.
The net book value of the long-lived asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than its book
value. The Company has determined that there is no impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets at January 31, 2023.
Note 7 – Mortgage debt and Long term debt, net
In connection with the purchase of a building in Farmingdale, NY in
November 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary (the “mortgagor subsidiary”) of the Company entered into a Fee Mortgage and Security
Agreement (the “mortgage agreement”) with Citibank, N.A. (the “mortgagee”). The mortgage agreement provides for
a loan of $ 4,500
for a term of
10 years , bears a fixed interest rate of
5.09 % per annum and requires monthly mortgage payments of principal
and interest of $ 30 . Debt issuance costs of $ 72
are being amortized over the life of the mortgage agreement. The balance of unamortized
debt issuance cost was $ 42
at January 31, 2023. At January 31, 2023, the balance owed by the subsidiary under the mortgage agreement was
$ 3,902 . The Company’s obligations under the mortgage agreement are secured by the building and by a $ 1,000
cash collateral deposit
with the mortgagee as additional security. This restricted cash is included in other assets as of January 31, 2023.
The mortgage agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants
and events of default, as defined. Events of default include non-payment of principal and interest on debt outstanding, non-performance
of covenants, material changes in business, breach of representations, bankruptcy or insolvency, and changes in control. The mortgage
includes certain financial covenants. Effective October 2020, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a covenant restructure whereby the
mortgagee waived the Company’s financial ratio covenant for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2020 and modified the mortgage to replace
that covenant with a liquidity covenant. The liquidity covenant requires that we own and maintain at all times and throughout the remaining
term of the loan at least $ 25,000
of liquid assets, defined as time deposits, money market accounts and obligations issued by the U.S.
government or any of its agencies. The cash collateral agreement was also modified to require compliance with the liquidity covenant for
two consecutive fiscal years before the collateral is released back to us.
Effective September 29, 2021, the Company and the mortgagee
agreed to further covenant restructuring whereby (a) the liquidity covenant was reduced to 150% of the loan principal (or approximately
$5,911 as of January 31, 2023) from $25,000 previously, and (b) the collateral requirement was increased from $750 to $1,000.
As of January
31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the liquidity covenant, but was in compliance with the other financial covenants related
to this mortgage. Effective March 20, 2023, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a waiver of the liquidity covenant default as of January
31, 2023. While the Company believes it will be able to either achieve compliance or obtain further waivers going forward, as there can
be no assurances, all of the mortgage debt has been classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023.
14
In April 2020, our subsidiary in Switzerland received a loan of CHF
400
(or $ 400 , based on the foreign exchange rate at that time) from the Swiss government under the “Corona Krise” emergency
loan program in response to the pandemic. This loan is uncollateralized and bears
0 % interest. In January 2022, the bank agent of the
Swiss government informed our subsidiary that the loan had to be fully amortized within a maximum of eight years and that the first of
semi-annual amortization payments of CHF
33
would begin in March 2022. In September 2022, the subsidiary made its second semi-annual principal
repayment of CHF
33
(or $ 35
based on exchange rates). Based on this amortization schedule, the loan will be repaid by September 2027.
The current portion of this loan is included in other current liabilities and the long term portion in long term debt – net as of
January 31, 2023.
The CARES Act expanded the U.S. Small Business Administration’s
(SBA) business loan program to create the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provided employers with uncollateralized loans whose
primary purpose was to retain or maintain workforce and salaries for a twenty-four week period (“covered period”) following
receipt of the loan. We applied for the PPP loan based on the eligibility and need requirements established when the program was announced
and in April 2020 received $ 7,000
through Citibank N.A., the Company’s existing lender, pursuant to the PPP (the “PPP Loan”).
In June 2021, the SBA approved in full our request for loan forgiveness and in the fiscal year 2021 the Company recognized the forgiveness
of the $ 7,000
loan in Other income. The SBA announced its intention to audit loans in excess of $ 2,000
and in June 2022 requested through
Citibank N.A. the production of documents and information related to our loan and our request for forgiveness. We provided that information
to the SBA via Citibank N.A. In October 2022 the SBA requested through Citibank N.A. that we complete a new version of their loan necessity
questionnaire with respect our forgiven loan, which we provided. The SBA subsequently requested additional information with respect to
wages paid which has been provided.
Minimum future annual principal payments under these agreements as

Note 8 - Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at
contract inception. The Company leases buildings, office space, patient service centers, and equipment primarily through operating leases,
and equipment through a limited number of finance leases. Generally, a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying
asset during the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the payment obligation arising from the lease, are recognized on the
balance sheet at lease commencement based on the present value of the payment obligation. For operating leases, expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense on the lease liability is recognized using the effective
interest method and amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases
with an initial term of
12
months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value
of lease payments as the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate.
15
The Company has lease agreements with (i) right-of-use asset payments
and (ii) non-lease components (i.e. payments related to maintenance fees, utilities, etc.,) which have generally been combined and accounted
for as a single lease component. The Company’s leases have remaining terms of less than
1
year to
6
years, some of which include
options to extend the leases for up to
5
years. The Company’s lease terms may include renewal options that are reasonably certain
to be exercised and early termination options that are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments
adjusted periodically for inflation or a market rate which are included in the lease liabilities.

As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company has established a reserve of $ 340
and $ 260 , respectively which is included in accrued
liabilities for payroll, benefits and commissions, for claims that have been reported but not paid and for claims that have been incurred
but not reported. The reserve is based upon the Company’s historical payment trends, claim history and current estimates.

Note 10 - Stockholders’ equity
Controlled Equity Offering
The Company has a Controlled Equity Offering SM
Sales Agreement
(the “Sales Agreement”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., as sales agent (“Cantor”). Under the Sales Agreement,
the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.01
per share
(the “Common Stock”). The Company pays Cantor a commission of
3.0 % of the aggregate gross proceeds received under the Sale
Agreement. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of the Shares under the Sales Agreement. The offering of Shares pursuant to
the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the sale of all of the Shares subject to the Sales Agreement or (b) the termination
of the Sales Agreement by Cantor or the Company, as permitted therein.
In September 2017, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 “shelf”
registration statement and sales agreement prospectus (the “Registration Statement”) covering the offering, issuance and sale
of our Common Stock that could have been issued and sold under the existing Sales Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $ 19.2
million.
The Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed in connection with the Sales Agreement expired in October 2020 but a new Registration Statement
could be refiled at any time at the discretion of the Company.
Share
based awards and share based compensation
In
January 2011, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2011 Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) for the
issuance of equity awards, including, among others, options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units for
up to
3,000,000
shares of common stock. In January 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the
2011 Plan (the “Amended and Restated 2011 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of common stock available for grant under
the 2011 Plan by
2,000,000
shares of common stock bringing the total number of shares available for grant to
5,000,000
shares of common
stock. On October 7, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated
2011 Plan, with an effective date of October 7, 2020 and subject to approval by the Company’s stockholders at the 2020 annual meeting
of stockholders of the Company.
The amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan was for purposes of, among other
things, (i) increasing the shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan by an additional 4,000,000
shares of common stock bringing the total number of shares available for grant to 9,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) extending
the term of the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan until October 7, 2030.
In January 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the
amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan.
The
exercise price of options granted under the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan, as amended and restated, is equal to or greater than fair
market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The Amended and Restated 2011 Plan, as amended and restated, will terminate at
the earliest of (a) such time as no shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the plan, (b) termination of the plan
by the Company’s Board of Directors, or (c) October 7, 2030. Awards outstanding upon expiration of the Amended and Restated 2011
Plan, as amended and restated, will remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired. As of January 31,
2023, there were approximately
3,874,000
shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan, as amended
and restated.
The
Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the measurement date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair
value of awards is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company expenses restricted stock
awards based on vesting requirements, primarily time elapsed. Performance stock awards are not recognized until it is probable they will
be earned. At such time, their expense is then recognized over the requisite service period, including that portion of the service period
already elapsed.
Options
granted pursuant to the plans may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory options. The 2011 Plan provides for the issuance
of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards which generally vest over a two or three year period.

Performance
Stock Units
Beginning
in fiscal 2018, the Company granted long-term incentive awards in the form of time based stock options and performance-based restricted
stock units (“Performance Stock Units” or “PSUs”). The PSUs earned is determined over a three-year performance
period. The primary performance metrics will be revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth, as defined. Payouts are based on revenue and adjusted
EBITDA goals met at threshold, target or maximum levels and are modified based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance
relative to Enzo’s peer group. The PSUs awarded to executive officers in fiscal 2018, net of forfeitures, expired in fiscal 2021
as the
3
year growth goals were not achieved.
During
the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2019, the Company awarded additional PSUs to its executive officers. These awards provide for the grant
of shares of our common stock at the end of a three-year period based on the achievement of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth
goals met at threshold, target or maximum levels over the respective period. The PSUs awarded to executive officers in fiscal 2019, net
of forfeitures, were earned as of the three-year period ending July 31, 2022 as the growth goals at the maximum level were achieved.
After TSR modification, a total of 25,200 PSUs were earned equally by two officers. As of January 31, 2023, 12,600 shares had been issued
and the balance of the shares are expected to be issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
19
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023 a former officer forfeited
15,000
PSUs awarded in fiscal 2020. The Company recorded PSU compensation
expense of $ 7
during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and ($ 48 ) during the six months ended January 31, 2023. For the three and
six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded PSU compensation expense of $ 96
and $ 162 , respectively.

Note
11 - Segment reporting
The
Company has two reportable segments: Clinical Services and Products. The Clinical Services segment provides diagnostic services to the
health care community. The Company’s Products segment develops, manufactures, and markets products to research and pharmaceutical
customers. The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment income (loss) before taxes. Costs excluded from segment income
(loss) before taxes and reported as “Other” consist of corporate general and administrative costs which are not allocable
to the two reportable segments.
Legal
and related expenses incurred to defend the Company’s intellectual property, which may result in settlements recognized in another
segment and other general corporate matters are considered a component of the Other segment. Legal and related expenses specific to other
segments’ activities are allocated to those segments. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
20
At
the beginning of fiscal 2023, we determined we would redirect our research resources and efforts to our two operating segments, Enzo
Life Sciences and Enzo Clinical Labs, and as a result, Enzo Therapeutics no longer meets the criteria for being a reportable segment.
The operating expenses of Enzo Therapeutics are included in the “Other” segment for all periods presented.
The

12 – Contingencies
On
or about March 2, 2023, a verified complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County captioned Elazar
Rabbani v. Mary Tagliaferri, et al., Index No. 651120/2023.  The verified complaint purports to assert causes of action for breach
of fiduciary duty and corporate waste under N.Y.B.C.L. § 720, and also seeks an accounting and certain injunctive relief.
Plaintiff served a copy of the verified complaint on Enzo’s agent for service in New York on or about March 13, 2023.  The Company
cannot predict the outcome of this matter; however, no inference whatsoever should be drawn from the absence of such prediction that
the Company will not prevail.
The
Company has brought cases in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (“the Court”), alleging patent
infringement against various companies. In 2017, the Court ruled that the asserted claims of the ’180 and ’405 Patents are
invalid for nonenablement in cases involving Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Gen-Probe, Hologic, and Roche. That ruling was affirmed by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) in June 2019. Enzo subsequently filed a petition
for certiorari regarding the invalidity ruling for the ’180 and ’405 Patents in February 2020; the Supreme Court denied Enzo’s
petition on March 30, 2020.
The
Company, along with its subsidiary Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., resolved its claims against Roche regarding the ’197 Patent before
the Court (civil action No. 12 cv-00106) in July 2022. There is currently one case that was originally brought by the Company that is
still pending in the Court. In that case, Enzo alleges patent infringement of the ’197 patent against Becton Dickinson Defendants.
The claims in that case are stayed.
In
separate inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) involving, among others, Becton Dickinson,
certain claims of the ’197 Patent were found unpatentable as anticipated or obvious and cancelled by the Patent Trial and Appeals
Board (“Board”). Enzo appealed that decision to the Federal Circuit. On August 16, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the
Board’s decision, finding that each of the challenged claims is unpatentable. The Company filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing
en banc on October 30, 2019, which the Federal Circuit denied on December 4, 2019. The Company filed a petition for certiorari with the
Supreme Court on March 3, 2020, which was denied.
In
April 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Hologic and Grifols, resolving litigation resulting from four cases originally
brought by the Company in the Court.  As a result, Enzo dismissed (1) a stayed patent litigation regarding the ’180 and ’197
Patent against Hologic in the Court; (2) the Consolidated Appeals against Gen-Probe and Hologic resulting from two cases filed in the
Court, and (3) the Company’s appeal in the litigation involving the ’581 Patent that involved both Hologic and Grifols. As
a result of the agreement with Hologic, Hologic withdrew from Enzo’s Federal Circuit appeal of the Board’s adverse rulings
in the
inter partes
review proceedings regarding the ’197 Patent filed by Hologic and joined by Becton Dickinson mentioned
above.
On
September 2, 2021, the PTO issued a non-final office action in an
ex parte
reexamination concerning the ’197 Patent. In
the office action, the PTO rejected certain claims of the ’197 Patent under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103, and for nonstatutory
double-patenting. Enzo responded to the office action on January 3, 2022, and the proceeding remains pending. Becton Dickinson requested
another
ex parte
reexamination concerning the ’197 patent on July 26, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the PTO ordered that
ex parte
reexamination as to certain claims of the ’197 patent and has not yet issued an office action. Enzo filed a petition
to terminate that second reexamination proceeding on November 16, 2022.
On
February 5, 2020, Harbert Discovery Fund, LP and Harbert Discovery Co-Investment Fund I, LP (“HDF”) brought an action in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and five of its present or former Directors,
Dr. Elazar Rabbani, Barry W. Weiner, Dr. Bruce A. Hanna, Dov Perlysky and Rebecca Fischer. On March 26, 2020, HDF filed an amended complaint
against the same defendants. Count I asserted the Company violated Section 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
14a-9 thereunder by disseminating proxy materials that made purportedly false statements. Count II asserted a claim against the individual
defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act premised on Enzo’s purported violation of Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9. Count
III asserted the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duty, based on the same conduct and by seeking to entrench themselves.
Finally, Count IV purported to assert a derivative claim for a declaration that any amendment to Article II, Section 2 requires the approval
of
80 % of Enzo’s shareholders. On July 16, 2020, the day before the defendants’ motion to dismiss was due, HDF asked the
Court to dismiss their claims without prejudice. Defendants asked HDF to dismiss the claims with prejudice, but they refused. On July
17, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims without prejudice.
24
On
November 27, 2020, the Company brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Harbert
Discovery Fund, LP, Harbert Discovery Co-Investment Fund I, LP, Harbert Fund Advisors, Inc., Harbert Management Corp. and Kenan Lucas
(together, “Harbert”). The Company alleged Harbert made false and misleading representations, or omitted to state material
facts necessary to make their statements not misleading, in proxy materials they disseminated seeking the election to the Company’s
Board of Directors at its 2019 Annual Meeting of two candidates they nominated, in violation of Section 14(a) of the 1934 Exchange Act
and Rule 14a-9 thereunder. The Company sought damages and injunctive relief. On October 12, 2021, HDF filed five counterclaims against
the Company and present and former directors Dr. Elazar Rabbani, Barry W. Weiner, Dr. Bruce A. Hanna, Dov Perlysky, Rebeca Fischer, Dr.
Mary Tagliaferri and Dr. Ian B. Walters. HDF claimed the Company made false and misleading representations in proxy materials it disseminated
in connection with its 2019 Annual Meeting, in violation of Section 14(a) of the 1934 Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and that
the Company’s directors at that time were liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for the Company’s purported misstatements.
HDF also claimed that current and former Company directors breached their fiduciary duties by taking four corporate actions: (a) adjourning
the 2019 meeting for 25 days; (b) purportedly causing the two Harbert candidates for director, who were elected at the 2019 Meeting,
to resign in November 2020; (c) authorizing the November 27, 2020 Lawsuit; and (d) not accepting Dr. Rabbani’s resignation as a
director in March 2021. On November 10, 2021, the Company and the other counterclaim defendants moved to dismiss HDF’s counterclaims.
On December 9, 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss HDF’s counterclaims except HDF’s Section 14(a) claim against
the Company concerning its statement that it intended to “delay” the 2019 Annual Meeting, and HDF’s Section 20(a) and
breach of fiduciary duty counterclaims against Dr. Elazar Rabbani, Barry W. Weiner, Dr. Bruce Hanna, Dov Perlysky and Rebecca Fischer
with respect to that statement. The Court allowed HDF to move for leave to replead with respect to its dismissed counterclaims. On June
7, 2022, the Court “so ordered” a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice of the Company’s claims against Harbert Discovery
Fund, LP, Harbert Discovery Co-Investment Fund I, LP, Harbert Fund Advisors, Inc., Harbert Management Corp., and Kenan Lucas, and HDF’s
counterclaims against the Company, Dr. Bruce Hanna, Dov Perlysky, Rebecca Fischer, Dr. Ian B. Walters and Dr. Mary Tagliaferri. The only
remaining claims were HDF’s counterclaims against Dr. Rabbani and Mr. Weiner. HDF asked the Court to dismiss those claims without
prejudice. Dr. Rabbani and Mr. Weiner asked the Court to dismiss those counterclaims with prejudice and to allow them to take discovery
from HDF, the Company, and possibly others. On December 1, 2022, the court granted HDF’s motion for voluntary dismissal without
prejudice, denied Dr. Rabbani and Mr. Weiner’s motion to compel discovery, and directed the Clerk of the Court to close this case.
There
can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of these litigations. Even if the Company is not successful, management
does not believe that there will be a significant adverse monetary impact on the Company. The Company is party to other claims, legal
actions, complaints, and contractual disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that any liability
that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on its financial position or results of operations.
As
described in Note 3, third-party payers, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing that
they contend was improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they
have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments already received.

Former
executives arbitration
The
Company terminated the employment of Elazar Rabbani, Ph.D., the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, effective April 21, 2022.
Dr. Rabbani remains a board director of the Company. Dr. Rabbani is a party to an employment agreement with the Company, which entitles
him to certain termination benefits, including severance pay, acceleration of vesting of share-based compensation, and continuation of
benefits. Based on the terms of his employment agreement, the Company estimated and accrued a charge of $ 2,600
in fiscal 2022 which is
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The charge was partially offset by the reversal of bonus accruals. In May 2022,
the Company paid Dr. Rabbani $ 2,123
in severance (the payment constituted taxable income but the Company did not withhold taxes from
the payment). In July 2022, the Company paid Dr. Rabbani’s income and other withholding taxes of $ 1,024
related to that payment
on Dr. Rabbani’s behalf, which is included in “prepaid expense and other current assets” as of July 31, 2022, as the
payment is reimbursable from Dr. Rabbani. Dr. Rabbani disputed, among other things, the Company’s decision to not award him a bonus
for fiscal year 2021 and the amount of severance that was owed to him under his employment agreement.  On July 8, 2022, the Company
filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) seeking, among other things, a declaration
that the Company has fully satisfied its contractual obligations to Dr. Rabbani and seeking the tax withholding reimbursement referenced
above.  On August 4, 2022, Dr. Rabbani filed counterclaims in the arbitration seeking, among other things, a bonus for fiscal year
2021 and additional severance that he asserts is owed to him.  The parties have chosen an arbitrator from the AAA’s panel
and a hearing is scheduled for June 8-16, 2023.
On
February 25, 2022, Barry Weiner, the Company’s co-founder and President, notified the Company that he was terminating his employment
as President of the Company for “Good Reason” as defined in his employment agreement. The Company accepted Mr. Weiner’s
termination, effective April 19, 2022, but disagreed with Mr. Weiner’s assertion regarding “Good Reason.” On July 20,
2022, Mr. Weiner filed a demand for arbitration with the AAA asserting, among other things, that his annual bonus for fiscal year 2021
was too low and that his resignation (effective April 19, 2022) was for “Good Reason” under the terms of his employment agreement.
He seeks, among other things, payment of a higher 2021 bonus, and severance payments and benefits. The parties have chosen an arbitrator
from the AAA’s panel and a hearing is scheduled for July 18-21, and 24, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has not accrued
any charges related to Mr. Weiner’s termination.
Note
13 – Subsequent Events – Agreement to sell assets of Clinical Labs division to Labcorp
On March 16, 2023, the Company filed a Form
8-K indicating that it and Enzo Clinical Labs, Inc. (the “Subsidiary” and, together with the Company, the “Seller”)
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware
corporation (the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell substantially all operating assets
and assign certain liabilities of its clinical labs business (the “Business”) to the Buyer which are necessary to operate
the Business in exchange for approximately $ 146,000,000
in cash (subject to certain adjustments), on and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein (such transaction, the “Transaction”).
The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and termination rights for a transaction of this nature,
including, among other things, customary covenants: (i) relating to the conduct of the Business between the signing of the Purchase
Agreement and the closing of the Transaction and (ii) regarding the efforts of the parties to cause the Transaction to be consummated,
including obtaining certain consents and approvals. The consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary
closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of any required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976. In addition, closing under the Purchase Agreement is contingent on the Company obtaining approval of the Transaction by
shareholders of the Company holding a majority of the shares of its common stock outstanding. Certain officers and directors of the Company
have agreed with Buyer to vote the shares they beneficially own, totaling up to approximately
11 % of the shares outstanding, in favor
of the Transaction.
The Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions
for both the Company and Buyer and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances,
including termination by the Company to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited Superior Proposal,
the Company will be required to pay Buyer a termination fee of $ 5,000,000
or reimbursement of Buyer’s expenses of up to $ 5,000,000 .
26
Subject
to the terms and conditions stated in the Purchase Agreement, after shareholder approval of the Transaction, Buyer will be obligated
to pay a fee to the Company for each day after the date of such approval until the closing of the Transaction.  At the closing of
the Transaction, such fee will be wholly or partially credited against the purchase price.
There
can be no assurances that the Purchase Agreement will close and if it does close, the exact proceeds to be received by the Company.
Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes and other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking
Statements
Our
disclosure and analysis in this report, including but not limited to the information discussed in this Item 2, contain forward-looking
information about our Company’s financial results and estimates, business prospects and products in research and development that
involve substantial risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we also may provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other
materials we release to the public. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify
these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate”,
“estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”,
“will”, and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operations or financial
performance.
In particular, these include statements relating to future actions,
including the Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale of substantially all assets and assignment of certain liabilities of the
Clinical Labs division and the timing of its closing, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current
and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign currency rates, intellectual property matters, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures we have taken in response, and financial results.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated,
estimated or projected. As a result, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. Investors
should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statement that we make, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. We are also affected by other factors
that may be identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some of which are set forth in Item
1A - Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filing for the July 31, 2022 fiscal year. You are advised to consult any further disclosures we make
on related subjects in our Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we have attempted to provide
a list of important factors which may affect our business, investors are cautioned that other factors may prove to be important in the
future and could affect our operating results.
You
should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors or to assess the impact of each factor or combination
of factors on our business. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
Impact
of COVID-19
We
made substantial investments to expand and maintain the amount of COVID-19 testing available in the communities we serve since the start
of the pandemic in March 2020. We applied our technical expertise in molecular diagnostics to develop next generation COVID-19 diagnostic
and antibody testing options which were approved under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). During the fiscal year ended July 31,
2022, the Company generated substantial COVID-19 related services revenues, representing 44% of all services revenues. This testing had
a significantly positive impact on the profitability and cash flow of our Clinical services segment for most of fiscal 2022. Revenues
from COVID-19 testing during the three and six months ended January 31, 2022 represented 56% and 52%, respectively of all services revenues.
The rate of transmission of COVID-19 and the severity of its variants have dramatically declined in the US. Revenues from COVID-19 testing
during the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 represented approximately 4% and 6%, respectively of all services revenues.
27
In
March 2022, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) informed providers that, after March 22, 2022,
it would stop accepting claims for testing and treatment for uninsured individuals under the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program and that
claims submitted prior to that date would be subject to eligibility and availability of funds. Although we believe that our estimates
for contractual allowances and patient price concessions are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. If the HRSA
receives additional funding, it might again accept claims under the Uninsured Program.
Federal,
state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in, among other things,
a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, and the continuation of work-from-home
policies. The COVID-19 impact on the Company’s operations is consistent with the overall industry and our competitors, partners,
and vendors. While we anticipate that COVID-19 will continue to impact our business into the future, increases in vaccination rates and
booster shots, the development of new therapeutics and greater availability of rapid COVID-19 tests has resulted in a continued, significant
decline in demand for our COVID-19 testing. As a result, volume, revenues, profitability, and cash flow from COVID-19 testing during
the current periods were all substantially and materially lower than the prior year period levels. COVID-19 testing is no longer a material
part of our Services business.
We
expect volume and revenues from COVID-19 testing will remain less significant in the periods ahead as the percentage of Americans who
are vaccinated increases, the severity of its variants declines, and the general increase in the use of “at home” testing.
However, the emergence and spread of potentially more serious variants may cause our COVID-19 testing volume to increase again. With
respect to our non-COVID-19 operations, even after the COVID-19 pandemic impact has greatly moderated, we may continue to experience
similar adverse effects to our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary
economic environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.
The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with
the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 and the recessionary economic environment,
including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates as of January 31, 2023 and through the date of this
Quarterly Report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s patient self-pay revenue concessions
and credit losses in the Clinical Services segment, accounts receivable, inventories and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived
assets. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other economic factors, could result
in additional material adverse impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

Results:
The
“2023 period” and the “2022 period” refer to the three months ended January 31, 2023 of fiscal year 2023 and
January 31, 2022 of the fiscal year 2022, respectively.
Impacts
of COVID-19
We
made substantial investments to expand and maintain the amount of COVID-19 testing available in the communities we serve since the start

The rate of transmission of COVID-19 and the severity of its variants have dramatically declined in the US. Revenues from COVID-19 testing

it would stop accepting claims for testing and treatment for uninsured individuals under the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program and that
claims submitted prior to that date would be subject to eligibility and availability of funds. Although we believe that our estimates
for contractual allowances and patient price concessions are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. If the HRSA
receives additional funding, it might again accept claims under the Uninsured Program.
30
Federal,
state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in, among other things,
a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, and the continuation of work-from-home
policies. The COVID-19 impact on the Company’s operations is consistent with the overall industry and our competitors, partners,

the current periods were all substantially and materially lower than the prior year period levels. COVID-19 testing is no longer a material
part of our Services business.
We
expect volume and revenues from COVID-19 testing will remain less significant in the periods ahead as the percentage of Americans who
are vaccinated increases, the severity of its variants declines, and the general increase in the use of “at home” testing.
However, the emergence and spread of potentially more serious variants may cause our COVID-19 testing volume to increase again. With
respect to our non-COVID-19 operations, even after the COVID-19 pandemic impact has greatly moderated, we may continue to experience
similar adverse effects to our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary
economic environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.
The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with
the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 and the recessionary economic environment,
including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates as of January 31, 2023 and through the date of this
Quarterly Report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s patient self-pay revenue concessions
and credit losses in the Clinical Services segment, accounts receivable, inventories and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived
assets. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other economic factors, could result
in additional material adverse impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Clinical
services revenues for the 2023 period were $8.8 million compared to $23.7 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $14.9 million or
63%. Revenues from COVID-19 testing decreased approximately $12.9 million and represented 4% and 56% of Clinical revenues in the 2023
and 2022 periods, respectively as COVID-19 accessions declined 96% in the 2023 period versus the 2022 period. Accessions from all other
testing increased 7% versus the 2022 period but revenues from this testing was down approximately $2.0 million period over period due
to payer and test mix and liquidation rate adjustments. Due to a Medicaid audit, we recorded a $1.0 million charge as a reduction of
revenue.
Estimated
collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims
processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when
estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered. Furthermore, the
current recessionary environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, have, in part, resulted
in longer lag periods between the time when we perform and report on our clinical services and when we are ultimately paid. Changes in
our estimates of collections could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In
2014, Congress passed the U.S. Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), which included substantial changes to the way in which
clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Beginning in 2018, Medicare payments for clinical laboratory services are paid
based upon the volume-weighted median of private payer rates as reported by certain clinical laboratories across the US, replacing the
previous system which was based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for clinical laboratory tests. We estimate that the
effect of PAMA directly negatively impacted reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid in both the 2023 and 2022 periods by $0.3 million.
Product
revenues were $7.5 million in the 2023 period and $10.4 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $2.9 million or 28%. The 2022 period
includes a $2.8 million bulk sale of a GMP reagent to a large industrial customer in the US. Excluding the bulk sale, in the 2023 period,
small decreases in revenues from European and Asia Pacific markets were almost offset by a small increase in revenues in the US market.
31
The
cost of Clinical Services was $10.5 million in the 2023 period and $12.6 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $2.1 million or 17%.
Due to the decline in revenues in the 2023 period versus 2022, our reagent costs decreased by $1.0 million and salaries by $1.1 million.
During the 2022 period, we significantly reduced our outside reference testing costs for COVID-19 by utilizing our internal manufacturing
capabilities, thereby reducing some of our reliance on testing and reagents sourced from third parties. The gross profit (loss) margin
on Clinical Services revenues in the 2023 period was approximately (19%) versus 47% in the 2022 period, due to the magnitude of the decline
in high margin COVID-19 testing, the Medicaid audit charge, and market changes resulting in liquidation rate adjustments.
The
cost of Product revenues was $4.6 million in the 2023 period and $5.3 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of approximately $0.6 million
or 12%, driven by lower revenues. The gross profit margin on Products was 39% in the 2023 period and 49% in the 2022 period. During the
2022 period we made a large bulk sale of a GMP reagent which had a significantly positive impact on the period’s profit margin.
Research
and development expenses were $1.4 million in the 2023 period and $0.8 million in the 2022 period, an increase of $0.6 million or 75%,
due to headcount increases and materials consumed.
Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $11.8 million during the 2023 period versus $14.5 million during the 2022 period, a decrease
of $2.6 million or 18%. The Other segment expense decreased $2.3 million during the 2023 period compared to 2022. In the 2022 period
we recorded $2.6 million for severance and other discrete employment matters related to the termination of our former chief executive
officer. During the 2023 period, increases in salaries, bonuses and benefits of $0.5 million were partially offset by decreases in share
based compensation, professional fees and insurance totaling $0.2 million. The Life Sciences Products expense decreased $0.5 million
during the 2023 period, of which $0.4 million was due to a decrease in marketing expenses and a $0.1 million decrease in administrative
costs. The Clinical Services expense increased $0.1 million due to increased marketing, information technology and insurance costs partially
offset by a decrease in outside services for administrative functions.
Legal
and related expenses were $1.0 million during the 2023 period compared to $2.8 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $1.8 million
or 65%. During the 2022 period, we incurred higher legal activities associated with strategic initiatives which include the sale of assets,
and other corporate matters related to two former executives’ arbitration, which are ongoing. The 2023 period expense is net of
a reimbursement of $0.8 million under the Company’s directors and officers insurance policy.
Interest
income, net was less than $0.1 million in both the 2023 and 2022 periods. The 2023 period’s income was higher due to higher interest
earned on cash in a money market fund. In the 2022 period, we also earned some interest on marketable securities in bond funds. In both
periods we had interest expense primarily on a mortgage.
Other
income (expense) in the 2023 and 2022 period was $0.1 million and ($0.4) million respectively, a favorable variance of approximately
$0.5 million. During the 2022 period, the primary component of the expense was unrealized losses on marketable securities in bond funds
held at that time as trading securities.
The
foreign exchange gain (loss) recognized by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2023 period was $1.4 million compared to ($0.5)
million in the 2022 period, a favorable variance of $1.9 million. The 2023 period revaluation gain was due to the significant appreciation
of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of the 2023 period compared to its start. The revaluation loss
in the 2022 period was due to the depreciation of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of that period
compared to its start.

Results:
The
“2023 period” and the “2022 period” refer to the six months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively,
which represent the first two quarters of the Company’s fiscal year ending July 31.
Clinical
services revenues for the 2023 period were $20.0 million compared to $43.4 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $23.4 million or
54%. Revenues from COVID-19 testing decreased approximately $21.3 million and represented 6% and 52% of Clinical revenues in the 2023
and 2022 periods, respectively as COVID-19 accessions declined 95% in the 2023 period versus the 2022 period. Accessions from all other
testing increased approximately 3% period but revenues from this testing was down approximately $2.1 million period over period due to
payer and test mix and liquidation rate adjustments. Due to a Medicaid audit, we recorded a $1.0 million charge as a reduction of revenue.
Estimated
collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims
processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when
estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered. Furthermore, the
current recessionary environment, including inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, have, in part, resulted
in longer lag periods between the time when we perform and report on our clinical services and when we are ultimately paid. While we
believe this to be a timing issue, any changes in our estimates of collections could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
In
2014, Congress passed the U.S. Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), which included substantial changes to the way in which
clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Beginning in 2018, Medicare payments for clinical laboratory services are paid
based upon the volume-weighted median of private payer rates as reported by certain clinical laboratories across the US, replacing the
previous system which was based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for clinical laboratory tests. We estimate that the
effect of PAMA directly negatively impacted reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid in the 2023 and 2022 periods by $0.5 and $0.6 million,
respectively.

revenues were $14.6 million in the 2023 period and $17.2 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of approximately $2.5 million or 15%.
The 2022 period includes a $2.8 million bulk sale of a GMP reagent to a large industrial customer in the US. Excluding the bulk sale,
in the 2023 period, there was an approximate $0.4 million increase in revenues in the US market, partially offset by a small decrease
in revenues in the European market.
The
cost of Clinical Services was $20.5 million in the 2023 period and $23.8 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $3.2 million or 14%.
Due to the decline in Services revenues in the 2023 period versus 2022, our reagent costs decreased by $1.8 million and salaries by $1.4
million. The gross profit (loss) margin on Clinical Services revenues in the 2023 period was approximately (3%) versus 45% in the 2022
period, due to the magnitude of the decline in high margin COVID-19 testing, the Medicaid charge, and market changes resulting in liquidation
rate adjustments. During the 2022 period, we significantly reduced our outside reference testing costs for COVID-19 by utilizing our
internal manufacturing capabilities, thereby reducing some of our reliance on testing and reagents sourced from third parties, which
improved the period’s profit margin.
The
cost of Product revenues was $9.2 million in the 2023 period and $9.3 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $0.1 million or 1%. The
gross profit margin on Products was approximately 37% in the 2023 period and 46% in the 2022 period. During the 2022 period we made a
large bulk sale of a GMP reagent which had a significantly positive impact on that period’s profit margin. The 2023 period gross
profit was also impacted by an increase in production headcount compared to the 2022 period.
Research
and development expenses were $2.4 million in the 2023 period and $1.6 million in the 2022 period, an increase of $0.8 million or 55%,
due to headcount increases and materials consumed.
Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $23.3 million during the 2023 period versus $25.5 million during the 2022 period, a decrease
of $2.2 million or 9%. The Other segment expense decreased $1.8 million during the 2023 period. In the 2022 period we recorded $2.6 million
for severance and other discrete employment matters related to the termination of our former chief executive officer. During the 2023
period, salaries, bonuses and benefits also decreased $0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million
for professional fees relating to advisory services including the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Company. The Life Sciences
Products expense in the 2023 period decreased $1.1 million compared to 2022, of which $0.6 million was due to a decrease in marketing
and selling expenses and a $0.1 million decrease in administrative costs. Additionally, the 2022 period includes $0.4 million for employee
severance and winding down costs associated with the closure of the Ann Arbor MI manufacturing and distribution center. The Clinical
Services expense increased $0.7 million due to increased salaries, marketing and facility costs totaling $1.6 million, partially offset
by lower commissions and outside administrative support services totaling $0.9 million.
Legal
and related expenses were $2.1 million during the 2023 period compared to $4.1 million in the 2022 period, a decrease of $2.0 million
or 49%. During the 2022 period, we incurred higher legal activities associated with strategic initiatives which include the sale of assets,
and other corporate matters related to two former executives’ arbitration, which are ongoing. The 2023 period expense is net of
a reimbursement of $0.8 million under the Company’s directors and officers insurance policy.
Interest
income, net was $0.1 million in both the 2023 and 2022 periods. The 2023 period’s interest income was earned on cash in a money
market fund. In the 2022 period, we earned interest on marketable securities in bond funds. In both periods we had interest expense primarily
on a mortgage.
Other
income (expense) in the 2023 period was $0.1 million versus ($0.5) million in the 2022 period, a favorable variance of approximately
$0.6 million. During the 2022 period, the primary component of the expense was unrealized losses on marketable securities in bond funds
held at that time as trading securities.
The
foreign exchange gain (loss) recognized by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2023 period was $0.7 million compared to ($0.8)
million in the 2022 period, a favorable variance of $1.5 million. The 2023 period revaluation gain was due to the significant appreciation
of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of the 2023 period compared to its start. The revaluation loss
in the 2022 period was due to the depreciation of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of that period
compared to its start.
34
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $21,955 and used cash in operating activities of $14,891. The
Company believes that based on its fiscal 2023 forecast, its current cash and cash equivalents level is not sufficient for its foreseeable
liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next twelve (12) months, which conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the unaudited interim financial statements are issued.
In response to these conditions, the Company is evaluating various
financing strategies to obtain sufficient additional liquidity to meet its operating, and capital requirements for the next twelve months
following the date of issuance of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Specifically, on March 10, 2023, the Company
signed a commitment letter providing for up to $8,000 of a revolving line of credit subject to closing, and as previously disclosed has
been exploring various strategic alternatives including the sale of segment operating assets. However, there can be no assurance that
either of these capital raising strategies will be successful, and the Company may need to raise additional capital during the current
fiscal year. On March 16, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to substantially all assets and assignment
of certain liabilities of the Clinical Labs division. See Note 13 Subsequent Events. Although there can be no assurances, in the event
additional capital is required, the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds, either through additional debt secured
by real property owned, private debt, selling preferred stock, reactivating and utilizing the Controlled Equity Offering Program, or through
other sources. That Program’s Form S-3 expired in October 2020 but may be refiled at any time at the discretion of the Company,
as disclosed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business
plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans. The unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
At
January 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $5.1 million of which $0.5 million was in foreign accounts, as compared
to cash and cash equivalents of $21.6 million, of which $0.6 million was in foreign accounts at July 31, 2022. It is the Company’s
current intent to permanently reinvest these foreign funds outside of the United States, and its current plans do not demonstrate a need
to repatriate them to fund its United States operations.
The Company had working capital of $4.29 million at January 31, 2023,
compared to $29.8 million at July 31, 2022, a decrease of $25.6 million. The decrease in working capital was due to the use of cash and
cash equivalents to fund operations, capital expenditures, and the reclassification of mortgage debt from long term to current.
Net
cash used in operating activities during the 2023 period was $14.9 million, compared to $6.7 million during the 2022 period, an unfavorable
variance of approximately $8.3 million. The net cash used in the 2023 period was due to the net loss of $22.0 million, which was partially
offset by a net increase of $3.6 million in operating liabilities, primarily accounts payable, an increase in non-cash expense adjustments
of $2.1 million, and a decrease in operating assets of $1.4 million, primarily prepaid assets and accounts receivable. In order to conserve
cash and maintain overall liquidity, the Company has been working with some vendors and professional services providers to delay payments,
which has resulted in a large increase in its accounts payable-trade balance at January 31, 2023 as compared to July 31, 2022.
Net
cash used in investing activities during the 2023 period was approximately $1.5 million as compared to $2.3 million in the 2022 period
and primarily represent capital expenditures to support and grow our existing operations, including investments in laboratory equipment,
information technology, and the buildout of our Farmingdale campus.
Cash used in financing activities in both the 2023 and 2022 periods
approximated $0.1 million for payments related to a mortgage and finance leases.
35
As
of January 31, 2023 we had a mortgage principal balance of $3.9 million entered into for the purchase of a building facility at our Farmingdale
campus, which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum. It requires monthly mortgage payments totaling $0.4 million annually. Our
obligations under the mortgage agreement are secured by the facility, assets of the Company, and by a $1.0 million cash collateral deposit
with the mortgagee as additional security, which is included in other assets as of January 31, 2023.
Effective
October 19, 2020, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a covenant restructure whereby the mortgagee waived the Company’s financial
ratio covenant for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2020 and modified the mortgage to replace a financial ratio covenant with a liquidity
covenant. The liquidity covenant required that we own and maintain at all times, and throughout the remaining term of the loan, at least
$25 million of liquid assets, defined as time deposits, money market accounts and commercial paper, and obligations issued by the U.S.
government or any of its agencies. The cash collateral agreement was also modified to require compliance with the liquidity covenant
for two consecutive fiscal years before the collateral is released back to us. As of July 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with
the financial and liquidity covenants in effect at that time related to this mortgage. Effective September 29, 2021, the Company and
the mortgagee agreed to further covenant restructuring whereby (a) the liquidity covenant was reduced to 150% of the loan principal (or
approximately $5.8 million at October 31, 2022) from $25 million previously, and (b) the collateral requirement would be increased from
$0.75 million to $1.0 million. The Company increased the collateral deposit to $1.0 million in November 2021 and was in compliance with
the liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2022 and July 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the liquidity
covenant, but was in compliance with the other financial covenants related to this mortgage. Effective March 20, 2023, the Company and
the mortgagee agreed to a waiver of the liquidity covenant default as of January 31, 2023. While the Company believes it will be able
to either achieve compliance or obtain further waivers going forward, as there can be no assurances, all of the mortgage debt has been
classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023.
Revolving
Line of Credit commitment
On
March 10, 2023, the Company entered into a commitment for a one-year credit facility with an asset based lender specializing in direct
lending to middle-market companies in the healthcare sector. The facility is an $8 million revolving line of credit based on the Company’s
eligible accounts receivable. The annual interest rate is equal to the 90 day term SOFR rate plus 5.5%. The line of credit would terminate
one year from closing and unused line fees and early prepayment penalties apply. The Company and the lender are using their best efforts
to close on the line of credit as soon as possible. The expected closing time period is the end of March 2023.
Other
conditions to closing are
● satisfactory
completion of the Company’s collateral field exam confirming, among other things, a
borrowing base reasonably consistent with the results of lender’s underwriting,
● the
execution of loan and security agreements with terms, representations, covenants, defaults,
clauses, conditions, and closing requirements satisfactory to lender,
● Deposit
account control agreements and lockbox agreements with depository banks in form and substance
acceptable to the lender,
● A signed Asset Purchase
Agreement (APA) for the sale of the Company’s Clinical Services segment in an amount and on terms and conditions satisfactory
to lender,
● Borrowers
shall provide all collateral and financial reports as lender may reasonably request, and
● Borrowers
shall have satisfactory insurance coverage with lender loss payee and additional insured
endorsements in favor of lender on all collateral.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
Asset Purchase Agreement
On March 16, 2023, the Company filed a Form 8-K, indicating that along
with Enzo Clinical Labs, Inc. (the “Subsidiary” and, together with the Company, the “Seller”) entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation
(the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell substantially all of the operating assets
and assign certain liabilities of its clinical labs business (the “Business”) to the Buyer which are necessary for the Buyer
to operate the Business in exchange for approximately $146,000,000 in cash (subject to certain adjustments), on and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein (such transaction, the “Transaction”).
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties,
covenants and termination rights for a transaction of this nature, including, among other things, customary covenants: (i) relating to
the conduct of the Business between the signing of the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Transaction and (ii) regarding the efforts
of the parties to cause the Transaction to be consummated, including obtaining certain consents and approvals. The consummation of the
Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of any required
waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In addition, closing under the Purchase Agreement is contingent
on the Company obtaining approval of the Transaction by shareholders of the Company holding a majority of the shares of its and directors
of the Company have agreed with Buyer to vote the shares they beneficially own, totaling up to approximately 11% of the shares outstanding,
in favor of the Transaction.
The Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions
for both the Company and Buyer and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances,
including termination by the Company to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited Superior Proposal,
the Company will be required to pay Buyer a termination fee of $5,000,000, or reimbursement of Buyer’s expenses of up to $5,000,000.
Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Purchase Agreement,
after shareholder approval of the Transaction, Buyer will be obligated to pay a fee to the Company for each day after the date of such
approval until the closing of the Transaction. At the closing of the Transaction, such fee will be wholly or partially credited against
the purchase price.
There can be no assurances that the Purchase Agreement will close and
if it does close, the exact proceeds to be received by the Company.
General
and estimates
The
Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc.’s
interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities.
37
On
an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contractual expense, allowance for uncollectible accounts, inventory,
intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
Revenues
– Clinical Services
Contractual
Adjustment
The
Company’s estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments, such as its interpretation of payer
reimbursement policies, and bears the risk of change. The estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable
and ultimately settled by payers, versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers. The contractual adjustment is
an estimate that reduces gross revenue, based on gross billing rates, to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed.
Gross
billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers, including Medicare, HMO’s and managed care. The
Company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly, based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience
with payers, industry reimbursement trends, and other relevant factors. The other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment
include the monthly and quarterly review of: 1) current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer, 2) current changes
in third party arrangements and 3) the growth of in-network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our Company.
Our
clinical business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients
65 and older) and insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant
changes of reimbursement rates. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues. The number
of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue
to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care. These trends
will continue to reduce our revenues from these programs.
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the contractual adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement
statistics, was 90.6% and 80.5% respectively, of gross billings. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the contractual
adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics, was 89.1% and 82.1% respectively, of gross
billings. The Company estimates (by using a sensitivity analysis) that each 1% point change in the contractual adjustment percentage
could result in a change in clinical services revenues of approximately $1.8 million and $2.4 million for the six months periods ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately $0.4 million as of January 31, 2023.
Our
clinical services financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual
adjustment by payer at the time of billing. Therefore, we are unable to quantify the effect contractual adjustments recorded during the
current period have on revenue recorded in a previous period. However, we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment
to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process, which includes:
●
an analysis of industry reimbursement trends;
●
an evaluation of third-party reimbursement rates changes
and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers;
●
a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical
claim settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers; and
●
an analysis of current gross billings and receivables
by payer.

Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of
the related revenue.
The
following is a table of the Company’s net accounts receivable by segment. The Clinical Laboratory Services segment’s net
receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022,
approximately 57% and 59%, respectively of the Company’s net accounts receivable relates to its Clinical Laboratory Services business,
which operates in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut medical communities. The Life Sciences products segment’s accounts receivable
includes foreign receivables of approximately $1.3 million or 29% and $1.1 million or 24% of total segment receivables as of January
31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.

The
Company’s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash
flows. The primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion
remains outstanding. The Company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement
issues. The Company assesses the impact, if any, on the allowance estimates, which involves Company’s management judgment. It is
important to note that the collection of these receivables is not guaranteed from Third Party Payers. The Company believes that the collectability
of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes, most notably, those related to obtaining the accurate
patient information to effectively bill for the services provided. Should circumstances change (e.g. shift in payer mix, decline in economic
conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables), our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material
amount. As of January 31, 2023, approximately 16% of Clinical Labs receivables are from one payer other than Medicare and as of July
31, 2022, approximately 23%, of Clinical Labs receivables are from two payers other than Medicare.
Billing
for laboratory services is complicated due to several factors, including, but not limited to, the differences between our standard gross
fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with, disparity of coverage and information requirements
among the various payers, and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized
for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits
will be realized in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under the liability method,
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. It is the Company’s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions, if any, and the related interest and penalties based upon
management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To
the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay
amounts in excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.
39
Inventory
The
Company values inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories
consist of material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Write downs of inventories to net realizable value are based on a review of inventory
quantities on hand and estimated sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Unanticipated changes in demand
could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and require additional write downs of inventory which would impact our
results of operations.
Goodwill
and Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
The
Company tests goodwill annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.
In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the
Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it identifies the reporting units and compares
the fair value of each of these reporting units to their respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is
less than its fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, the impairment
charge is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit.
The
Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets of an asset or asset group for impairment annually as of
the end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Should indicators of impairment exist, the
carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of an asset or
asset group. The net book value of the long-lived asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flow is less
than its book value. The Company has determined that there is no impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets at January 31, 2023.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We
are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from acquisitions with foreign locations (See Item
1A. Risk Factors section of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022) that could impact our results of operations and financial
position. We do not currently engage in any hedging or market risk management tools.
Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The
financial reporting of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since the functional currency
of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency, foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar versus
foreign currencies at January 31, 2023, our assets and liabilities would decrease by $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and
our net revenues and net income (loss) would decrease by $0.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively, on an annual basis.
We
also maintain intercompany balances and loans with subsidiaries in different local currencies. These amounts are at risk of foreign exchange
losses if exchange rates fluctuate. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies,
our pre-tax earnings (loss) would be unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.1 million on an annual basis.
40
Interest
Rate Risk
As
of January 31, 2023, we have fixed interest rate financing on a building mortgage and equipment finance leases.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s management conducted an evaluation (as required under Rules 13a-15(b)
and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of the Company’s “disclosure
controls and procedures” (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act), under the supervision and with the participation of
the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information
otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic reports.
(b)
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risk Factors
There
have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, except as follows:
Liquidity
and Going Concern
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $21,955 and used cash in operating activities of $14,891. The
Company believes that based on its fiscal 2023 forecast, its current cash and cash equivalents level is not sufficient for its foreseeable
liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next twelve (12) months, which conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the unaudited interim financial statements are issued.
In response to these conditions, the Company is evaluating various
financing strategies to obtain sufficient additional liquidity to meet its operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months
following the date of issuance of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Specifically, on March 10, 2023, the Company
signed a commitment letter providing for up to $8,000 of a revolving line of credit subject to closing, and as previously disclosed is
exploring various strategic alternatives including the sale of segment operating assets. On March 16, 2023, the Company entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale to Labcorp of substantially all the operating assets and assignment of certain liabilities
which are necessary for Labcorp to operate the business of the Clinical Labs division. See Note 13 Subsequent Events. However, there can
be no assurance that either of these capital raising strategies will be successful, and the Company may need to raise additional capital
during the current fiscal year. The Company also believes it has the ability to raise additional funds, either through additional debt
secured by real property owned, private debt, selling preferred stock, reactivating its Sales Agreement with Cantor, or through other
sources, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise capital pursuant to the foregoing on favorable terms or
at all. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed in connection with the Sales Agreement expired in October 2020 but a new Registration
Statement could be filed at any time at the discretion of the Company, as disclosed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic
conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans. The
unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.
There can be no guarantee that the Asset
Sale will be completed and, if not completed, we may have to file for bankruptcy and liquidation.
The consummation of the Asset Sale is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the approval of the Asset Sale by our stockholders. We cannot guarantee
that the closing conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions
in Buyer's favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Buyer will not be obligated to complete the Asset Sale. If the
Asset Sale is not completed, our board of directors, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, will evaluate other
strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our stockholders as the Asset Sale and may
include a bankruptcy and liquidation of the Company.
The Company has incurred and will continue
to incur substantial expenses, including transaction-related costs, pending the Asset Sale.
Claims, liabilities and expenses from operations, such as operating
costs, salaries, directors’ and officers’ insurance, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and office
expenses will continue to be incurred by us during the pendency of the Asset Sale. Further, Enzo has incurred, and expects to continue
to incur, a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs in initiating and completing the Asset Sale. Non-recurring transaction
costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to Enzo’s financial, legal and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs.
These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. We cannot estimate what the aggregate of these expenses will be
and these costs may be higher than expected.  There can be no assurance of the exact amount of net cash proceeds Enzo will receive
from the Asset Sale or the exact timing at which it will receive such proceeds. Therefore, it is uncertain the extent to which our financial
condition and operations will benefit from or improve as a result of or after the Asset Sale.
42
The Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions
for both the Company and Buyer and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances,
including termination by the Company to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited Superior Proposal,
the Company will be required to pay Buyer a termination fee of $5,000,000, or reimbursement of Buyer’s expenses of up to $5,000,000.
Subject
to the terms and conditions stated in the Purchase Agreement, after shareholder approval of the Transaction, Buyer will be obligated
to pay a fee to the Company for each day after the date of such approval until the closing of the Transaction.  At the closing of
the Transaction, such fee will be wholly or partially credited against the purchase price.
There
can be no assurance that the Purchase Agreement will close and that if it does close, the exact proceeds to be received by the Company.
