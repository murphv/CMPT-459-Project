Therefore, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes normally included in annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
The October 31, 2022 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet has been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting principally of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income, statements of shareholders' equity and statements of cash flows for such interim periods presented.
The results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire fiscal year. The Company has two operating segments:
the Flight Support Group (“FSG”), consisting of HEICO Aerospace Holdings Corp. and HEICO Flight Support Corp. ("HFSC") and their respective subsidiaries; and the Electronic Technologies Group (“ETG”), consisting of HEICO Electronic Technologies Corp. and its subsidiaries. The Company’s results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 continued to reflect the adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the Company's supply chain.
Despite the aforementioned, the Company experienced continued improvement in operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 principally reflecting improved demand for its commercial aerospace products.
The Flight Support Group has reported ten consecutive quarters of improvement in net sales and operating income resulting from commercial air travel recovery in certain domestic travel markets, moderated by a slower recovery in international travel markets.      New Accounting Pronouncement     In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-08, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers," which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with
7 Inde x Customers," as if the acquirer had originated the contracts.
The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in no material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 2.      ACQUISITION On January 5, 2023, the Company, through HEICO Electronic, acquired
93.69 % of the outstanding common stock and all of the preferred stock of
Exxelia International SAS
(“Exxelia”).
Exxelia designs, manufactures and sells high reliability (“Hi-Rel”), complex, passive electronic components and rotary joint assemblies for mostly aerospace and defense applications, in addition to other high-end applications, such as medical and energy uses, including emerging “clean energy” and electrification applications.
The Company believes that this acquisition will further HEICO's strategy of expanding its already wide range of mission-critical and Hi-Rel components for the most demanding applications, as well as provide HEICO with added broad geographic and product diversity, including in the important European market.
The remaining
6.31 %
interest continues to be owned by certain members of Exxelia's management team (see Note 3, Selected Financial Statement Information - Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for additional information).
Additionally, as a result of this acquisition,
the Company also obtained a
90 % ownership interest in
Alcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd.
(“Alcon”), which is an existing subsidiary of Exxelia.
The remaining
10 % interest continues to be owned by a certain member of Alcon’s management team (See Note 3, Selected Financial Statement Information – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for additional information).
The purchase price of this acquisition was paid in cash, using proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility. The following table summarizes the total consideration for the acquisition of Exxelia (in thousands): Cash paid
$ 515,785   Less: cash acquired
( 14,257 ) Total consideration paid, net $ 501,528   As noted above, the Company acquired all of the preferred stock of Exxelia.
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, Exxelia’s preferred stock accrues dividends at
5.18 % per annum.
Additionally, in connection with the acquisition,
HEICO issued Exxelia a ten-year € 150  million note, which accrues interest at
4.7 % per annum on the principal outstanding.
The Company records foreign currency transaction adjustments on the note receivable within selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 8 Inde x The following table summarizes the allocation of the total consideration for the acquisition of Exxelia to the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed (in thousands): Assets acquired: Goodwill

12,063   Net assets acquired, excluding cash $ 501,528   The allocation of the total consideration to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed is preliminary until the Company obtains final information regarding their fair values.
The primary items that generated the goodwill recognized were the premiums paid by the Company for the future earnings potential of Exxelia and the value of its assembled workforce that do not qualify for separate recognition, however, benefit both the Company and the noncontrolling interest holders.
The fair value of the noncontrolling interests were determined based on the consideration paid by the Company for its controlling ownership interest adjusted for a lack of control that a market participant would consider when estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest.
The amortization period of the customer relationships, intellectual property and trade name acquired is
18
years,
16
years and indefinite, respectively.
Acquisition costs associated with the purchase of Exxelia totaled $ 5.1  million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and were recorded as a component of SG&A expenses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The operating results of Exxelia were included in the Company’s results of operations from the effective acquisition date.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company's consolidated net sales includes $ 15.0  million from the acquisition of Exxelia, and the acquisition did not have a material impact on net income attributable to HEICO.

19.9 % noncontrolling equity interest in a subsidiary of the FSG that was acquired in fiscal 2015 exercised their option to cause the Company to purchase their noncontrolling interest over a four-year period ending in fiscal 2026.
Accordingly, the Company acquired one-fourth of such interest in December 2022, which increased the Company's ownership interest in the subsidiary to
85.1 %. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands): Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension Plan Accumulated

The Company is cooperating with the investigation.
The Company has completed its production of documents responsive to the subpoena, although the Company has a continuing obligation to produce such documents should any be located.
At this early stage in the investigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the investigation or when the investigation will ultimately be resolved; nor can the Company reasonably estimate the possible range of loss or impact to its business, if any, that may result from this matter. With the exception of the matter noted above, the Company is involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business.
Based upon the Company’s and its legal counsel’s evaluations of any claims or assessments, management is of the opinion that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 23 Inde x Item 2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates if different assumptions were used or different events ultimately transpire. Our critical accounting policies, which require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended January 31, 2023. Our business is comprised of two operating segments:
the Flight Support Group (“FSG”), consisting of HEICO Aerospace Holdings Corp. and HEICO Flight Support Corp. and their respective subsidiaries; and the Electronic Technologies Group (“ETG”), consisting of HEICO Electronic Technologies Corp. and its subsidiaries. Our results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 continued to reflect the adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our supply chain.
Despite the aforementioned, we experienced continued improvement in operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 principally reflecting improved demand for our commercial aerospace products.
The Flight Support Group has reported ten consecutive quarters of improvement in net sales and operating income resulting from commercial air travel recovery in certain domestic travel markets, moderated by a slower recovery in international travel markets. Additionally, our results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 have been affected by the fiscal 2022 acquisitions as further detailed in Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 and the fiscal 2023 acquisition as further detailed in Note 2, Acquisition, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this quarterly report. 24 Inde x Results of Operations The following table sets forth the results of our operations, net sales and operating income by segment and the percentage of net sales represented by the respective items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands): Three months ended January 31, 2023 2022 Net sales $620,915  $490,343  Cost of sales 377,116  300,133  Selling, general and administrative expenses 114,365  91,388  Total operating costs and expenses 491,481  391,521  Operating income $129,434  $98,822  Net sales by segment: Flight Support Group $371,278  $272,681  Electronic Technologies Group 255,059  222,336  Intersegment sales (5,422) (4,674) $620,915  $490,343  Operating income by segment: Flight Support Group $83,609  $52,376  Electronic Technologies Group 56,537  55,588  Other, primarily corporate (10,712) (9,142) $129,434  $98,822  Net sales 100.0  % 100.0  % Gross profit 39.3  % 38.8  % Selling, general and administrative expenses 18.4  % 18.6  % Operating income 20.8  % 20.2  % Interest expense (1.0  %) (.2  %) Other income

The increase in consolidated net sales principally reflects an increase of $98.6 million (a 36% increase) to a record $371.3 million within the FSG and an increase of $32.7 million (a 15% increase) to $255.1 million within the ETG.
The net sales increase in the FSG reflects strong organic growth of 25% as well as net sales of $31.5 million contributed by our fiscal 2022 acquisitions.
The FSG's organic growth reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the prior year.
As such, organic net sales increased by $41.6 million, $16.9 million and $8.7 million within our aftermarket replacement parts, specialty products, and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines, respectively.
The net sales increase in the ETG principally reflects $32.8 million contributed by our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions.
The ETG's organic net sales were consistent with the prior year and principally reflected increased demand for our other electronics, aerospace and medical products resulting in net sales increases of $11.2 million, $4.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, offset by decreased demand for our defense products resulting in a net sales decrease of $18.2 million.
Although sales price changes were not a significant contributing factor to the change in net sales of the FSG and ETG in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, recent cost inflation and potential supply chain disruptions may lead to higher sales prices during the remainder of fiscal 2023. Gross Profit and Operating Expenses
Our consolidated gross profit margin improved to 39.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from 38.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 principally reflecting a 2.7% improvement in the FSG's gross profit margin, partially offset by a 1.5% decrease in the ETG's gross profit margin.
The increase in the FSG's gross profit margin principally reflects lower inventory obsolescence expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 mainly due to increased demand within our aftermarket replacement parts product line, and the previously mentioned higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and specialty products product lines.
The reduction in the ETG's gross profit margin principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales for our defense products, partially offset by the previously mentioned increase in net sales for our other electronics and aerospace products.
Total new product research and development expenses included within our consolidated cost of sales were $20.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $18.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $114.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to $91.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in consolidated SG&A expenses principally reflects $9.9 million attributable to our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions, a $4.8 million increase in acquisition costs mainly related to the fiscal 2023 acquisition and a $3.9 million increase in performance-based compensation expense.
26 Inde x Our consolidated SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 18.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, down from 18.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decrease in consolidated SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales principally reflects efficiencies realized from the higher net sales, partially offset by a .8% impact from the previously mentioned increase in acquisition costs. Operating Income Our consolidated operating income increased by 31% to $129.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $98.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in consolidated operating income principally reflects a $31.2 million increase (a 60% increase) to a record $83.6 million in operating income of the FSG and a $.9 million increase (a 2% increase) to $56.5 million in operating income of the ETG.
The increase in operating income of the FSG principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume.
The increase in operating income of the ETG principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales increase, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in acquisition costs related to the fiscal 2023 acquisition, and the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin.
Our consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from 20.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase principally reflects an increase in the FSG’s operating income as a percentage of net sales to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from 19.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, partially offset by a decrease in the ETG's operating income as a percentage of net sales to 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to 25.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in the FSG’s operating income as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and a .6% impact from a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies.
The decrease in the ETG's operating income as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and a 1.3% impact from an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from a 2.0% impact from the previously mentioned higher acquisition costs, partially offset by a .4% favorable impact from a decrease in performance-based compensation expense.
Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $6.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase was principally due to higher interest rates. 27 Inde x Other Income
Other income in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was not material. Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rate was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to 4.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in our effective tax rate principally reflects a larger tax benefit from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
We recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 of $6.2 million and $17.8 million, respectively.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests relates to the 20% noncontrolling interest held by Lufthansa Technik AG in HEICO Aerospace Holdings Corp. and the noncontrolling interests held by others in certain subsidiaries of the FSG and ETG.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to $7.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests principally reflects improved operating results of certain subsidiaries of the FSG and ETG in which noncontrolling interests are held, inclusive of fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions.
Net Income Attributable to HEICO Net income attributable to HEICO increased by 7% to $93.0 million, or $.67 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $86.9 million, or $.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 principally reflecting the previously mentioned higher consolidated operating income, partially offset by the increase in the effective tax rate. Outlook As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the FSG and ETG, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products.
Additionally, continued inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher material and labor costs.
During fiscal 2023, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration, and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility.
28 Inde x Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal uses of cash include acquisitions, capital expenditures, cash dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests and working capital needs.
We now anticipate fiscal 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $45 to $50 million.
We finance our activities primarily from our operating and financing activities, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
The revolving credit facility contains both financial and non-financial covenants.
As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants and our total debt to shareholders’ equity ratio was 28.5%. Based on our current outlook, we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and consisted primarily of net income from consolidated operations of $103.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $27.1 million (a non-cash item), net changes in other long-term liabilities and assets related to the HEICO LCP of $8.9 million (principally participant deferrals and employer contributions), $3.8 million in employer contributions to the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (a non-cash item), and $2.8 million in share-based compensation expense (a non-cash item), partially offset by a $63.0 million increase in net working capital and a $6.3 million payment of contingent consideration.
The increase in net working capital is inclusive of a $52.0 million increase in inventories to support an increase in consolidated backlog, a $7.3 million increase in contract assets and a $7.1 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from the timing of collections.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from $78.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decrease is principally attributable to a $6.3 million payment of contingent consideration and a $5.1 million increase in net working capital, partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in net income from consolidated operations.
The increase in net working capital primarily resulted from the previously mentioned increases in inventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and income taxes payable. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $526.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and related primarily to acquisitions of $503.7 million, investments related to the LCP of $11.8 million and capital expenditures of $10.8 million.
Further details regarding our fiscal 2023 acquisition may be found in Note 2, Acquisition, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Inde x Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $449.2 million.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we borrowed $531.0 million under our revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by $38.0 million in payments made on our revolving credit facility, redemptions of common stock related to stock option exercises aggregating $14.8 million, $13.7 million of cash dividends on our common stock, $11.3 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests and $3.7 million of contingent consideration payments.
Other Obligations and Commitments
There have not been any material changes to our other obligations and commitments that were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022. New Accounting Pronouncement     See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - New Accounting Pronouncement, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 30 Inde x Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature may be forward-looking and the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate” and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, phone calls and conference calls, concerning our operations, economic performance and financial condition are subject to risks, uncertainties and contingencies.
We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events.
All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements.
Also, forward-looking statements are based upon management’s estimates of fair values and of future costs, using currently available information.
Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements as a result of factors including, but not limited to: the severity, magnitude and duration of public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic ("Health Emergencies"); HEICO's liquidity and the amount and timing of cash generation; lower commercial air travel caused by Health Emergencies and their
aftermath, airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demand for our goods and services; product specification costs and requirements, which could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts; governmental and regulatory demands, export policies and restrictions, reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers or competition from existing and new competitors, which could reduce our sales; our ability to introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce our sales or sales growth; product development or manufacturing difficulties, which could increase our product development and manufacturing costs and delay sales; our ability to make acquisitions, including obtaining any applicable domestic and/or foreign governmental approvals, and achieve operating synergies from acquired businesses; customer credit risk; interest, foreign currency exchange and income tax rates; economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, within and outside of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries, which could negatively impact our costs and revenues; and defense spending or budget cuts, which could reduce our defense-related revenue.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. 31 Inde x Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK There have not been any material changes in our assessment of HEICO’s sensitivity to market risk that was disclosed in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, except as discussed below: In connection with our acquisition of Exxelia, we issued Exxelia a ten-year €150 million note, which accrues interest at 4.7% per annum on the principal outstanding.
A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the United States ("U.S.") dollar in comparison to the Euro as of January 31, 2023 would decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of our Euro note receivable by approximately $16.3 million and decrease operating income by the same amount.
Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that HEICO’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, HEICO's internal control over financial reporting. 32 Inde x PART II.
