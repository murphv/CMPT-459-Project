Note 1.     Organization and Basis of Presentation Western Digital Corporation (“Western Digital” or the “Company”) is a leading developer, manufacturer, and provider of data storage devices and solutions based on both flash-based products (“Flash”) and hard disk drives (“HDD”) technologies. With dedicated Flash and HDD business units driving advancements in memory technologies, the Company creates and drives innovations needed to help customers capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data. The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Part II, Item 8, Note 1,
Organization and Basis of Presentation,
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended July 1, 2022. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended July 1, 2022. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks. Approximately every five to six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align the fiscal year with the foregoing policy. Fiscal years 2023, which ends on June 30, 2023, and 2022, which ended on July 1, 2022, are each comprised of 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks. Segment Reporting The Company manufactures, markets, and sells data storage devices and solutions in the U.S. and in foreign countries through its sales personnel, dealers, distributors, retailers, and subsidiaries. The Company manages and reports under
two
reportable segments: Flash and HDD. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) evaluates performance of the Company and makes decisions regarding allocation of resources based on each operating segment’s net revenue and gross margin. Because of the integrated nature of the Company’s production and distribution activities, separate segment asset measures are not available or reviewed by the CODM to evaluate the performance of or to allocate resources to the segments. Use of Estimates Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the periods presented with consideration given to the potential impacts of current macroeconomic conditions. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 11 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 2.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and results in fewer instruments with embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with prior standards. Those instruments that do not have a separately recognized embedded conversion feature will no longer recognize a debt issuance discount related to such a conversion feature and would recognize less interest expense on a periodic basis. Additionally, the ASU amends the calculation of the share dilution impact related to a conversion feature and eliminates the treasury method as an option.
The Company adopted the new standard effective July 2, 2022, the first day of the year ending June 30, 2023, using the modified retrospective method. On the date of adoption, the Company recorded a reduction in Additional Paid-In Capital of $ 128  million, a reduction of unamortized debt discount o f
$ 48  million, a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities of $ 11  million, and an increase to retained earnings of $ 91  million for the after-tax impact of previously recognized amortization of the debt discount associated with the Co mpany’s convertible senior notes. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance” (“ASU 2021-10”). ASU 2021-10 increases the transparency of government assistance received by requiring most business entities to disclose information about government assistance received, including (1) the types of assistance, (2) the entity’s accounting for the assistance, and (3) the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2021, which for the Company is the first quarter of 2023. The Company adopted this ASU on July 2, 2022, the first day of the year ending June 30, 2023, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations”. This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company uses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more-likely-than-not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary. If the Company concludes from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, the Company is required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment. As of December 30, 2022, management identified several continuing factors, including changes in macroeconomic conditions and recent declines of the Company’s market stock price, that warranted quantitative analyses of impairments for both the Flash and HDD reporting units as of such date. The fair value of each operating segment was based on a weighting of two valuation methodologies: an income approach and a market approach.
The income approach was based on the present value of the projected discounted cash flows (“DCF”) expected to be generated by the operating segment. Those projections required the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions, which included, among other factors, revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating costs, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. The present value was based on applying a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) which considered long-term interest rates and cost of equity based on the Company’s risk profile.

(Unaudited)
The market approach was based on a guideline company method, which analyzed market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies.
The Company reconciled the aggregated estimated fair value of both operating segments to the Company’s market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company. As of December 30, 2022, the fair value derived from those valuation methodologies exceeded the carrying value by
9 % and
28 % for Flash and HDD, respectively. There were
no
impairment charges recorded for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022.
The Company is required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of reporting units as well as their actual carrying value may change based on future changes in the Company’s results of operations, macroeconomic conditions or other factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect the Company’s assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment. In addition, if negative macroeconomic conditions continue or worsen or the Company’s stock price decreases further for a sustained period of time, goodwill could become impaired, which could result in an impairment charge and materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition results of operations. 15 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 4.     Revenues
Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration where performance obligations are completed but the customer payments are not due until another performance obligation is satisfied. The Company did not have any contract assets as of either December 30, 2022 or July 1, 2022. Contract liabilities relate to customers’ payments in advance of performance under the contract and primarily relate to remaining performance obligations under professional service and support and maintenance contracts. Contract liabilities as of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022 and changes in contract liabilities for the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not material. The Company incurs sales commissions and other direct incremental costs to obtain sales contracts. The Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize the direct incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period is expected to be one year or less or the amount is not material, with these costs charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company had no direct incremental costs to obtain contracts that have an expected benefit of greater than one year. The Company applies the practical expedients and does not disclose transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for (i) arrangements that have an original expected duration of one year or less, which mainly consist of the support and maintenance contracts, and (ii) variable consideration amounts for sale-based or usage-based royalties for intellectual property (“IP”) license arrangements, which typically have a duration of longer than one year. Remaining performance obligations are mainly attributed to right-to-access patent license arrangements, professional service arrangements and customer support and service contracts which will be recognized over the remaining contract period. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations as of December 30, 2022 was $ 17  million, which is mainly attributable to the functional IP license and professional service arrangements. The Company expects to recognize this amount as revenue as follows: $ 14  million during the remainder of 2023, and $ 3  million in 2024 and thereafter. 16 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 6.     Fair Value Measurements and Investments Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value Financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period are classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels: Level 1.     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2.     Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3.     Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The following tables present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such values: December 30, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets: Cash equivalents - Money market funds $ 435   $ —   $ —   $ 435   Foreign exchange contracts —   105   —   105   Interest rate swap contracts —   6   —   6   Total assets at fair value $ 435   $ 111   $ —   $ 546   Liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts $ —   $ 97   $ —   $ 97   Total liabilities at fair value $ —   $ 97   $ —   $ 97   July 1, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets: Cash equivalents - Money market funds $ 266   $ —   $ —   $ 266   Foreign exchange contracts —   61   —   61   Interest rate swap contracts —   3   —   3   Total assets at fair value $ 266   $ 64   $ —   $ 330   Liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts $ —   $ 316   $ —   $ 316   Total liabilities at fair value $ —   $ 316   $ —   $ 316   During the periods presented, the Company had no transfers of financial assets and liabilities between levels and there were no changes in valuation techniques or the inputs used in the fair value measurement.

Note 7.     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities As of December 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as either cash flow hedges or non-designated hedges. Substantially all of the contract maturity dates of these foreign exchange forward contracts do not exceed
12  months. In addition, the Company had outstanding pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments through February 2023, on a portion of its term loans. Changes in fair values of the non-designated foreign exchange contracts are recognized in Other income (expense), net and are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. For each of the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI. For more information regarding cash flow hedges, see Note 5,
Supplemental Financial Statement Data - Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Netting Arrangements Under certain provisions and conditions within agreements with counterparties to the Company’s foreign exchange forward contracts, subject to applicable requirements, the Company has the right of offset associated with the Company’s foreign exchange forward contracts and is allowed to net settle transactions of the same currency with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022, the effect of rights of offset was not material and the Company did not offset or net the fair value amounts of derivative instruments in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 22 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

billion principal amount under its $ 2.25  billion revolving credit facility maturing in January 2027 (the “2027 Revolving Credit Facility”). In December 2022, the Company amended the credit agreement governing the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A-2 for the purposes of providing flexibility by adjusting the leverage ratio requirements of the financial covenant thereunder through the Company’s quarter ending September 27, 2024 (such period, the “Covenant Relief Period”).
As amended, the Company is required to maintain a maximum ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) of total funded debt to trailing twelve-month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of each quarter as follows:
Quarter ending: Leverage ratio December 30, 2022 3.25
to 1.00 March 31, 2023 3.75

to 1.00 December 27, 2024 and thereafter 3.25
to 1.00 As of December 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with this financial covenant. The amendment also provides that the due date for amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be accelerated from January 7, 2027 to November 2, 2023 if, as of that date, the Company does not have Cash and cash equivalents plus available unused capacity under its credit facilities that exceed by $ 1  billion the sum of the outstanding balance of the
1.50 % convertible notes due 2024 plus the outstanding principal amount of any other debt maturing within 12 months. In addition, during the Covenant Relief Period, the amendment requires certain subsidiaries of the Company to provide guarantees if the corporate family ratings of the Company from at least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. (the “Credit Rating Agencies”) drops below investment grade and includes limits on secured indebtedness and certain types of unsecured subsidiary indebtedness. 23 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In January 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement”), which allows the Company to draw a single unsecured loan of up to $ 875  million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) through June 30, 2023. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement may be terminated, at the election of the Company, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions. Any amount drawn under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement will mature
364
days following the date of the initial draw. However, the due date will be accelerated to November 2, 2023 if conditions for acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement have been triggered as described above.
The Delayed Draw Term Loan will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (x) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin varying from
1.750 % to
2.625 % or (y) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from
0.750 % to
1.625 %, in each case depending on the corporate family ratings of the Company from at least two of the Credit Rating Agencies. The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee on the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement of
0.200 %. The key covenants, limitations and requirements provided under Credit Agreement amendment noted above also apply to the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. As described in Note 2,
Recent Accounting Pronouncements,
the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective July 2, 2022, using a modified retrospective method, which resulted in the elimination of the originally recorded debt discount associated with the conversion feature on its

Note 10.     Related Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies
Flash Ventures The Company’s business ventures with Kioxia Corporation (“Kioxia”) consist of
three
separate legal entities: Flash Partners Ltd. (“Flash Partners”), Flash Alliance Ltd. (“Flash Alliance”), and Flash Forward Ltd. (“Flash Forward”), collectively referred to as “Flash Ventures”. The following table presents the notes receivable from, and equity investments in, Flash Ventures: December 30, 2022 July 1, 2022 (in millions) Notes receivable, Flash Partners $ 12   $ 27   Notes receivable, Flash Alliance 66   55   Notes receivable, Flash Forward 737   793   Investment in Flash Partners 174   166   Investment in Flash Alliance 251   243   Investment in Flash Forward 117   112   Total notes receivable and investments in Flash Ventures $ 1,357   $ 1,396   During the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company made net payments to Flash Ventures of $ 1.0
billion and $ 2.0
billion, and $ 1.1
billion and $ 2.3
billion, respectively, for purchased flash-based memory wafers and net loans. The Company makes, or will make, loans to Flash Ventures to fund equipment investments for new process technologies and additional wafer capacity. The Company aggregates its Flash Ventures’ notes receivable into one class of financing receivables due to the similar ownership interest and common structure in each Flash Venture entity. For all reporting periods presented, no loans were past due and no loan impairments were recorded. The Company’s notes receivable from each Flash Ventures entity, denominated in Japanese yen, are secured by equipment owned by that Flash Ventures entity. As of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022, the Company had accounts payable balances due to Flash Ventures of $ 368  million and $ 320
million, respectively. The Company’s maximum reasonably estimable loss exposure (excluding lost profits) as a result of its involvement with Flash Ventures, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 30, 2022, is presented below. Investments in Flash Ventures are denominated in Japanese yen, and the maximum estimable loss exposure excludes any cumulative translation adjustment due to revaluation from the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar.

The Company is obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing its share of Flash Ventures’ flash-based memory wafer supply, based on its three-month forecast, which generally equals  50 % of Flash Ventures’ output. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output the Company chooses to purchase. The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers. In addition, the Company is committed to fund
49.9 % to
50.0 % of each Flash Ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments. In January 2022, the Company entered into additional agreements regarding Flash Ventures’ investment in a new wafer fabrication facility currently under construction in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “Y7”. The primary purpose of Y7 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flash-based wafer capacity to newer flash technology nodes. The Company is committed to pay, among other items, future building depreciation prepayments aggregating approximately $ 147  million as follows: $ 124  million for the remaining six months of 2023 and $ 23  million in 2024, to be credited against future wafer charges. Inventory Purchase Commitments with Flash Ventures.  Purchase orders placed under Flash Ventures for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled. Research and Development Activities.
The Company participates in common research and development (“R&D”) activities with Kioxia and is contractually committed to a minimum funding level. R&D commitments are immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities Flash Ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement. The lease agreements are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events related to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors. The occurrence of a cancellation event could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations and a call on the Company’s guarantees.
The following table presents the Company’s portion of the remaining guarantee obligations under the Flash Ventures’ lease facilities in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar-equivalent, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 30, 2022.

The Company has not made any indemnification payments, nor recorded any indemnification receivables, under any such agreements. As of December 30, 2022, no amounts have been accrued in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to these indemnification agreements. Unis Venture The Company has a joint venture with Unisplendour Corporation Limited and Unissoft (Wuxi) Group Co. Ltd. (“Unis”), referred to as the “Unis Venture”, to market and sell the Company’s products in China and to develop data storage systems for the Chinese market in the future. The Unis Venture is
49 % owned by the Company and
51 % owned by Unis. The Company accounts for its investment in the Unis Venture under the equity method of accounting. Revenue on products distributed by the Unis Venture is recognized upon sell through to third-party customers. For both the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, the Company recognized approximately
3 % of its consolidated revenue on products distributed by the Unis Venture. For both the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately

Note 11.     Leases and Other Commitments
Leases The Company leases certain domestic and international facilities and data center space under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2034. These leases include no material variable or contingent lease payments. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments minus any lease incentives. Extension or termination options present in the Company’s lease agreements are included in determining the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The following table summarizes supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases as of December 30, 2022:

Purchase Agreements and Other Commitments In the normal course of business, the Company enters into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture its products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. The Company also enters into long-term agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments, which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components.
As of December 30, 2022, the Company had the following minimum long-term commitments: Long-Term Commitments (in millions) Year: Remaining six months of 2023 $ 193   2024 256   2025 180   2026 53   2027 46   Thereafter 150   Total $ 878   30 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stock Repurchase Program The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $ 5.0
billion of the Company’s common stock, which authorization is effective through July 25, 2023. The Company did not make any stock repurchases during the six months ended December 30, 2022 and has not repurchased any shares of its common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Although the Company will reevaluate the repurchasing of common stock when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when or at what level the Company may resume such activity. The remaining amount available to be repurchased under the Company’s current stock repurchase program as of December 30, 2022 was $ 4.5  billion. Repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. 32 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 13.     Income Tax Expense The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses. The Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. However, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 Act since the enactment date, and the Company anticipates the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance. The Company applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 Act along with the then-available guidance in finalizing its accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. Any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information, which may require further refinements to the Company’s estimates in future periods. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained significant law changes related to tax, climate, energy, and health care. The tax measures include, among other things, a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The corporate alternative minimum tax will not be effective for the Company until fiscal year 2024 and the Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of these legislative changes. The following table presents the Company’s Income tax expense and the effective tax rate: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 ($ in millions) Income (loss) before taxes $ ( 385 ) $ 646   $ ( 301 ) $ 1,350   Income tax expense 61   82   118   176   Effective tax rate ( 16 ) % 13   % ( 39 ) % 13   % Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Act requires the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred. The tax effects related to the capitalization of R&D expenses are included in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 but did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2024 through 2031. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2024 through 2031. In addition, the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 included the discrete effect of an increase to unrecognized tax benefits of $ 8  million and $ 25  million, respectively, as a result of ongoing discussions with various taxing authorities. Uncertain Tax Positions With the exception of certain unrecognized tax benefits that are directly associated with the tax position taken, unrecognized tax benefits are presented gross in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 33 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding accrued interest and penalties for the three months ended December 30, 2022 (in millions): Accrual balance at July 1, 2022 $ 1,047   Gross increases related to current year tax positions 4   Gross increases related to prior year tax positions 11   Gross decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 12 ) Settlements ( 5 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 3 ) Accrual balance at December 30, 2022 $ 1,042   As of December 30, 2022, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was $ 1.04
billion. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties included in the Company’s liability related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2022 was $ 279
million. Of these amounts, approximately $ 1.18
billion could result in potential cash payments.
As previously disclosed, the IRS issued statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to transfer pricing with the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances for years 2008 through 2015. In September 2018 and March 2019, the Company filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court covering years 2008 through 2012, for which it had received statutory notices of deficiency, while years 2013 through 2015 remain in the jurisdiction of the IRS’s Examination function. The IRS has filed various Amendments to Answer with the U.S. Tax Court which, together with the notices of proposed adjustments, would result in additional federal income tax liabilities totaling approximately $ 1.6  billion and penalties totaling $ 449  million with respect to years 2008 through 2015. In May 2022, the Company and the IRS tentatively reached a settlement for resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2008 through 2015 subject to the parties entering into final stipulations and a closing agreement. Based on the tentative settlement for resolution, the Company expects to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $ 720  million to $ 760  million, which the Company expects to be partially offset by future reductions to its mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions aggregating to approximately $ 100  million to $ 150  million. While the Company continues to work with the IRS to come to a final agreement on the federal tax and interest calculations, the Company is uncertain as to when a final agreement will be reached and the exact timing of when any payments will be made. However, the Company believes it is reasonably likely that these payments may be made within the next twelve months and has classified that portion of these unrecognized tax benefits, including interest in Income taxes payable on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2022. This classification and amount may be subject to change in the next twelve months depending on when the Company is able to reach a final agreement with the IRS. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from any other tax examinations. However, the outcome of such tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Any significant change in the amount of the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of the Company’s tax returns. 34 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 14.     Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per common share: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions, except per share data) Net income (loss) $ ( 446 ) $ 564   $ ( 419 ) $ 1,174   Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 318   312   317   311   Employee stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and ESPP —   3   —   4   Basic and diluted 318   315   317   315   Income (loss) per common share Basic $ ( 1.40 ) $ 1.81   $ ( 1.32 ) $ 3.77   Diluted $ ( 1.40 ) $ 1.79   $ ( 1.32 ) $ 3.73   Anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded 15   5   15   3   The Company computes basic income (loss) per common share using Net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed using Net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, RSUs and PSUs, and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s ESPP. For the three and six months ended and December 31, 2021, the Company excluded common shares subject to certain outstanding equity awards from the calculation of diluted shares because their impact would have been anti-dilutive based on the Company’s average stock price during the period. For the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss and all shares subject to outstanding equity awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares for those periods because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. 35 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 15.     Employee Termination, Asset Impairment, and Other Charges Business Realignment
The Company periodically incurs charges as part of the integration process of recent acquisitions and to realign its operations with anticipated market demand, primarily consisting of organization rationalization designed to streamline its business, reduce its cost structure and focus its resources.
The Company recorded the following charges related to these actions: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Employee termination benefits $ 61   $ 3   $ 85   $ 18   Asset impairments and losses on disposal of assets 15   ( 1 ) 15   2   Total employee termination, asset impairment, and other charges $ 76   $ 2   $ 100   $ 20   The following table presents an analysis of the components of these activities against the reserve during the six months ended December 30, 2022: Employee Termination Benefits (in millions) Accrual balance at July 1, 2022 $ 17   Charges 85   Cash payments ( 69 ) Accrual balance at December 30, 2022 $ 33   36 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Tax Expense . Other Matters In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, any monetary liability and financial impact to the Company from these matters could differ materially from the Company’s expectations. 37 Table of Contents WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 17.     Subsequent Events On January 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the designation of
900,000
shares of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01
per share (the “Preferred Shares”) from the Company’s existing
five million
authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and issued the Preferred Shares through a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of $ 900  million. The Preferred Shares will have a stated value of $ 1,000
per share and accrue a cumulative preferred dividend at an annual rate of
6.25 % per annum (increasing to
7.25 % per annum on January 31, 2030 and to
8.25 % per annum on January 31, 2033) compounded on a quarterly basis. The Preferred Shares will also participate in any dividends declared for common shareholders on an as-converted equivalent basis. The Preferred Shares will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion rate of $ 47.75
per share (the “Conversion Price”) (subject to anti-dilution adjustments and certain other one-time adjustments upon the occurrence of various specified spin-off transactions) applied to the aggregate of the stated value plus any cumulative accrued but unpaid dividends (the “Accumulated Stated Value”). In the event of a standalone spin-off transaction, the holders of Preferred Shares may have one third of their Preferred Shares converted to a similar class of preferred shares of the spin-off entity. The Preferred Shares will be convertible at the option of the holder beginning on January 31, 2024, or on the date a specified spin-off transaction is completed, if earlier. The Preferred Shares will be convertible at the option of the Company after January 31, 2026 if the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds
150 % of the Conversion Price for at least
20
out of
30
consecutive trading days. After January 31, 2030, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem the Preferred Shares at an amount equal to
110 % of the Accumulated Stated Value. Redemption is contingently mandatory in the event of a fundamental change in the business as defined in the designation of the Preferred Shares. The Preferred Shares will vote on an as-converted equivalent basis along with holders of the Company’s common stock, except to the extent that shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock would exceed
19.9 % of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the original issuance date of the Preferred Stock. In the event of liquidation, holders of the Preferred Shares will be senior to the holders of the Company’s common stock.
38 Table of Contents Item 2.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. You should read this information in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2022. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise indicated, references herein to specific years and quarters are to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. As used herein, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer to Western Digital Corporation and its subsidiaries. Our Company We are on a mission to unlock the potential of data by harnessing the possibility to use it. We are a leading developer, manufacturer, and provider of data storage devices based on both flash-based products (“Flash”) and hard disk drives (“HDD”) technologies. With dedicated business units driving advancements in NAND flash and magnetic recording technologies, we create and drive innovations needed to help customers capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data. Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks. Approximately every five to six years, we report a 53-week fiscal year to align the fiscal year with the foregoing policy. Fiscal years 2023, which ends on June 30, 2023, and 2022, which ended on July 1, 2022, are each comprised of 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks. Key Developments Strategic Alternatives In June 2022, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing long-term value for stockholders. The Executive Committee of our Board of Directors is overseeing the assessment process and evaluating a range of alternatives, including options for separating our Flash and HDD business units. As of December 30, 2022, we are still actively working with our financial advisors and our legal counsel in this strategic review process. Operational and COVID-19 Pandemic Update Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, higher interest rates and recession concerns have softened demand for our products, with certain customers reducing purchases as they adjust their production levels and right-size their inventories. As a result, we and our industry are experiencing a supply-demand imbalance, which has resulted in reduced shipments and negatively impacted pricing, particularly in Flash. We expect the market pressures on Flash pricing to continue for the next few quarters. Since the beginning of fiscal 2023, we have scaled back on capital expenditures, consolidated production lines and reduced bit growth to align with market demand and implemented measures to reduce operating expenses.
This has resulted in incremental charges for Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges and manufacturing underutilization charges in HDD in the second quarter of 2023 and may impact near-term results. In addition, we have reduced wafer starts for Flash by 30% as of January 2023 and expect underutilization charges for that business unit to impact near-term results. However, we believe digital transformation will continue to drive long-term growth for data storage in both Flash and HDD and believe that the actions we are taking will position us for more profitable growth as supply and demand levels begin to balance. We believe we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio to meet our customers’ growing and evolving storage needs. Our BiCS5 based products continue to play a significant role in driving top line results across our end markets. Additionally, hard drive products utilizing OptiNAND and shingled magnetic recording (“SMR”) technologies have commenced commercial shipments and our latest 26-terabyte SMR drives are undergoing qualifications at multiple cloud and OEM customers. We continued commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our next generation 3D-flash technology and are beginning productization of BiCS8, which incorporates new 3D-NAND architectural innovations to deliver improved performance and cost-effectiveness. We are aware of the ongoing trends in the HDD Client market as PCs shift from using HDD to Flash technology and as a result, we have and are still undergoing actions to restructure our HDD manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic, including a sharp reduction in our client hard drive production capacity. 39 Table of Contents The COVID-19 environment has begun to normalize. The responses to COVID-19 taken by ourselves and others in the supply chain contributed to increases in the costs of their services which in turn impacted our operations, but these costs have now largely been normalized in our operating results.
We will continue to actively monitor recent developments impacting our business and may take additional responsive actions that we determine to be in the best interests of our business and stakeholders. See “Adverse global or regional conditions could harm our business,” “Public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future, have a negative effect on our business” and “We are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical services, materials or components, and a disruption in our supply chain could negatively affect our business” in Part I, Item 1A,
Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2022 for more information regarding the risks we face as a result of macroeconomic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Financing Activities In December 2022, we amended the loan
agreement governing our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A-2 to modify the leverage ratio requirements of our financial covenant through our quarter ending September 27, 2024 to provide additional financial flexibility as we navigate through the current dynamic economic environment. The amendment also accelerates the due date for amounts outstanding under the loan agreement from January 7, 2027 to November 2, 2023 if, as of that date, our cash and cash equivalents plus available unused capacity under our credit facilities does not exceed by $1 billion the sum of the outstanding balance of our 1.50% convertible notes due 2024 plus the outstanding principal amount of any other debt maturing within 12 months. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2023, on January 25, 2023, we entered into a new delayed draw term loan agreement, which allows us to draw a single unsecured loan of up to $875 million any time through June 30, 2023. Any amount drawn will be due 364 days after funding or such earlier date that conditions for acceleration of amounts due under the loan agreement have been triggered as described above. Also, on January 31, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $900 million. We believe these transactions will provide us with greater financial flexibility to manage our business. Additional information regarding our indebtedness, including the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, is included in Part I, Item 1, Note 8,
Debt , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 8, Note 8,

Subsequent Events , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Tax Resolution As previously disclosed, we have received statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to 2008 through 2015. During 2022, new information became available which required us to re-measure our unrecognized tax benefits for this IRS matter. Additionally, during 2022, we and the IRS tentatively reached a settlement for resolving this matter. Additional information regarding this tentative settlement and our assessment of the potential tax and interest payments we expect to pay in connection with the settlement is provided in our discussion of Income tax expense in our results of operations below, as well as in Part I, Item 1, Note 13,
Income Tax Expense , of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and in the “Short- and Long-Term Liquidity-Unrecognized Tax Benefits” section below. Russia Sanctions In February 2022, the U.S. and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia. In accordance with these sanctions, we have ceased shipments to distributors for customers located in Russia. Our revenue from distributors for customers in Russia have not been significant. We have no material assets or operations in Russia. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Second Quarter and First Half Overview

These items are further discussed below in our discussion by segment. Flash revenue decreased 37% and 34% for the three and six months ended
December 30, 2022, respectively
from the comparable periods in the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a decline in average selling prices per gigabyte caused by a supply-demand imbalance, which was exacerbated by the current macroeconomic environment.
HDD revenue decreased 34% for the
three months ended
December 30, 2022
from the comparable period in the prior year, substantially all of which was driven by a decrease in exabytes sold. The decline in exabytes sold was primarily driven by customers primarily in our Cloud and to a lesser extent in Client and Consumer end markets due to the macroeconomic pressures noted in “Operational and COVID-19 Pandemic Update” above and our end customers right-sizing their inventories. HDD revenue decreased 27% for the
six months ended
December 30, 2022
from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by a 22% decrease in exabytes sold as well as a decrease in the average price per gigabyte. The decrease in exabytes sold for the six-month period was largely attributable to the same factors noted above for the three-month period with pricing per gigabyte impacted by a higher mix of enterprise drives. The decrease in Cloud revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year reflected a decline in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers, as they reduced purchases to right-size their inventories. In Client, the decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year was primarily driven by the decline in
average selling price per gigabyte in Flash
and, to a lesser extent, a decline in client SSD shipments for PC applications. In Consumer, the decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflected the decrease in
average selling price per gigabyte in Flash and to a lesser
extent, a decline in retail HDD shipments. The decreases in Cloud and Consumer revenue for the six months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflected the same drivers noted above for the three-month period, respectively. In Client, the decrease in revenue for the six months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflected a decline in average selling price
per gigabyte
in Flash and, to a lesser extent, a decline in both Flash and HDD shipments for PC applications, due to lower demand as a result of macroeconomic pressures.
44 Table of Contents The changes in net revenue by geography for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable periods in the prior year reflected a larger decline in Asia from lower Client revenue from OEMs in this region as they reduced purchases to align with current market demand, as well as routine variations in the mix of business. Our top 10 customers accounted for 47% of our net revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2022, compared to 46% of our net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our top 10 customers accounted for 48% of our net revenue for the six months ended December 30, 2022, compared to 44% of our net revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2021. For each of the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue. Consistent with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. These programs represented 18% of gross revenue for each period presented. The amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, list pricing strategies, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of products. Changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin Consolidated gross profit decreased by $1.06 billion for the three months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year, which reflects the impact from the decrease in revenue in both Flash and HDD as well as approximately $100 million of charges in the current period related to manufacturing underutilization in HDD. Consolidated gross margin decreased 15.8 percentage points for the
three months ended
December 30, 2022
from the comparable period in the prior year, which primarily reflects lower average price per gigabyte in Flash and the impact of the underutilization charges in HDD. Flash gross margin decreased by 21.6 percentage points year over year, primarily reflecting the lower average selling price per gigabyte. HDD gross margin decreased by 9.9 percentage points year over year, of which the underutilization charge reflected approximately 7 percentage points with the remainder primarily driven by lower economies of scale as we tempered production.
Consolidated gross profit decreased by $1.74 billion for the six months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable period in the prior year, which reflects the decrease in revenue in both HDD and Flash and the approximate $100
mi llion underutilization charge in HDD during the
three months ended
December 30, 2022 , partially offset by a $64 million decrease during the
six months ended
December 30, 2022
in charges related to amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, some of which became fully amortized. Consolidated gross margin decreased 10.8 percentage points for the
six months ended
December 30, 2022
from the comparable period in the prior year, which reflects lower gross margin in both Flash and HDD and the underutilization charges noted above. Flash and HDD gross margin decreased by 16.9 and 5.6 percentage points year over year, respectively, reflecting the same factors noted above for the three-month period. Operating Expenses Research and development (“R&D”) expense decreased $52 million and $78 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, respectively, from the comparable periods in the prior year. The declines were primarily driven by a reduction in variable compensation expenses and material use as we took actions to reduce expenses in the current environment. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased $29 million and $73 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, respectively, from the comparable periods in the prior year. The declines were primarily driven by a reduction in expenses related to outside services, variable compensation expenses, and material use as we took actions to reduce expenses in the current environment.
Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges increased $74 million and $80 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, respectively, from the comparable periods in the prior year. The increases were due to restructuring actions taken to adjust our cost structure to align with the current demand environment. For information regarding Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, see Part I, Item 1, Note 15,
Employee Termination, Asset Impairment, and Other Charges
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Total interest and other expense, net decreased $17 million for each of the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 from the comparable periods in the prior year reflecting lower foreign exchange losses and lower interest expense resulting from the pay-down of principal on our debt. 45 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses. We completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. However, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 Act since the enactment date, and we anticipate the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance. We applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 Act along with the then-available guidance in finalizing our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. Any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information, which may require further refinements to our estimates in future periods. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained significant law changes related to tax, climate, energy, and health care. The tax measures include, among other things, a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The corporate alternative minimum tax will not be effective for us until fiscal year 2024. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of these legislative changes.
The following table sets forth income tax information from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations by dollar and effective tax rate:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ in millions Income (loss) before taxes $ (385) $ 646  $ (301) $ 1,350  Income tax expense 61  82  118  176  Effective tax rate (16) % 13  % (39) % 13  % Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Act requires us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred. The tax effects related to the capitalization of R&D expenses are included in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, but did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2024 through 2031.
The primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2024 through 2031. In addition, the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 included the discrete effect of an increase to unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million and $25 million, respectively, as a result of ongoing discussions with various taxing authorities. Our future effective tax rate is subject to future regulatory developments and changes in the mix of our U.S. earnings compared to foreign earnings. The 2017 Act requires us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred. As described above, these capitalized expenses are included in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, but did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate in those periods due to our reduced profitability. Mandatory capitalization of R&D is expected to materially increase our effective tax rate and taxes paid in future periods, if not repealed or otherwise modified. In addition, our total tax expense in future years may also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies.

Income Tax Expense , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 46 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows:
Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 41  $ 1,187  Investing activities (482) (569) Financing activities (12) (1,456) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3) (1) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (456) $ (839) We and the IRS tentatively reached a basis for resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to fiscal years 2008 through 2015. We currently expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $720 million to $760 million, which we expect to be partially offset by future reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions aggregating to approximately $100 million to $150 million. See Part I, Item 1, Note 13,
Income Tax Expense , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.
We have an existing shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in August 2024, which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. We may use the Shelf Registration Statement or other capital sources, including other offerings of equity or debt securities or the credit markets, to satisfy future financing needs, including planned or unanticipated capital expenditures, investments, debt repayments or other expenses. Any such additional financing will be subject to market conditions and may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
We
believe our cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities, including the availability under our new delayed term loan agreement and the proceeds from the issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock as discussed in “Key Developments - Financing Activities”, will be sufficient to satisfy our IRS obligation and meet our working capital, debt and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. We believe we can also access the various debt capital markets to further supplement our liquidity position. Our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Part I, Item 1A,
Risk Factors,
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2022.
As noted previously, we are scaling back on capital expenditures and consolidating production lines and reducing bit growth to align with market demand. We are now reducing our expected expenditures for property, plant and equipment for our company plus our portion of the capital expenditures by our Flash Ventures joint venture with Kioxia for its operations from our previous estimate of an aggregate of $2.7 billion down to $2.3 billion for 2023. After consideration of the Flash Ventures’ lease financing of its capital expenditures and net operating cash flow, we have reduced the expected net cash used for our purchases of property, plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable relating to Flash Ventures from a cash outflow of $1.3 billion to an amount below $1 billion during 2023. The total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability, timing and terms of related financing . A total of $1.33 billion and $1.84 billion of our Cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash.
Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities. In addition, from time to time, we also invest directly in certificates of deposit, asset backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds. 47 Table of Contents Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities. This represents our principal source of cash. Net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was $257 million for the six months ended December 30, 2022, as compared to $715 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, which largely reflects the reduction in volume of our business. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on our volume of business and the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes. Our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales. The cash conversion cycles were as follows (in days): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Days sales outstanding 56  52  Days in inventory 133  102  Days payables outstanding (55) (68) Cash conversion cycle 134  86  Changes in days sales outstanding (“DSO”) are generally due to the timing of shipments. Changes in days in inventory (“DIO”) are generally related to the timing of inventory builds, including staging of inventory to meet expected future demand. Changes in days payables outstanding (“DPO”) are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period. From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors. We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment term accommodations. For the three months ended December 30, 2022, DSO increased by 4 days from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments and customer collections. DIO increased by 31 days from the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflecting a decline in products shipped.
DPO decreased by 13 days from the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures and HDD production levels as well as routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period.
We have seen no significant deterioration in our receivables as a result of COVID-19 or other market conditions. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 30, 2022 primarily consisted of $578 million in capital expenditures partially offset by a $82 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to Flash Ventures. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of $551 million in capital expenditures and a $17 million net increase in notes receivable issuances to Flash Ventures. Financing Activities During the six months ended December 30, 2022, cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of $55 million used for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans, partially offset by $48 million from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans. In addition, we drew and repaid $1.18 billion under our revolving credit facility within the period. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of $2.43 billion for repayment of debt, as well as $80 million for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans offset by proceeds of $998 million from the issuance of new debt, and $60 million from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans. 48 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the commitments related to Flash Ventures incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see “Short and Long-term Liquidity-Purchase Obligations and Other Commitments” below), we do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, with the exception of Flash Ventures and our joint venture with Unisplendour Corporation Limited and Unissoft (Wuxi) Group Co. Ltd., we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any variable interest entities. For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Part I, Item 1, Note 10,

In addition to cash requirements for unrecognized tax benefits discussed below, the following is a summary of our known material cash requirements, including those for capital expenditures, as of December 30, 2022: Total 1 Year (Remaining Six Months of 2023) 2-3 Years (2024-2025) 4-5 Years (2026-2027) More than 5 Years (Beyond 2027) (in millions) Long-term debt, including current portion (1) $ 7,100  $ —  $ 1,363  $ 4,738  $ 999  Interest on debt 1,256  154  609  387  106  Flash Ventures related commitments (2) 5,274  1,950  2,545  913  (134) Operating leases 344  24  91  82  147  Purchase obligations and other commitments 3,613  2,591  773  99  150  Mandatory Deemed Repatriation Tax 657  —  402  255  —  Total $ 18,244  $ 4,719  $ 5,783  $ 6,474  $ 1,268  (1) Principal portion of debt, excluding discounts and issuance costs. (2) Includes reimbursement for depreciation and lease payments on owned and committed equipment, funding commitments for loans and equity investments and payments for other committed expenses, including R&D and building depreciation. Funding commitments assume no additional operating lease guarantees. Additional operating lease guarantees can reduce funding commitments. Debt In addition to our existing debt, as of December 30, 2022, we had $2.25 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility until January 2027, subject to customary conditions under the loan agreement. Furthermore, we entered into a delayed draw term loan agreement as noted in “Key Developments - Financing Activities” which provides us with an additional $875 million unsecured term loan available to borrow through June 30, 2023, subject to customary conditions and certain financial covenants under the loan agreement. The agreements governing these credit facilities each include limits on secured indebtedness and certain types of unsecured subsidiary indebtedness and require certain of our subsidiaries to provide guarantees to the extent the conditions providing for such guarantees are met.
Additional information regarding our indebtedness, including information about principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 8,
Debt , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2022. Our delayed draw term loan agreement and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility and our Term Loan A-2 due 2027 require us to comply with a leverage ratio financial covenant. As of December 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenant.
Flash Ventures Flash Ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which we guarantee half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement. The leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors. The occurrence of a cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the lease obligations and a call on our guarantees. As of December 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under these Japanese lease facilities. See Part I, Item 1, Note 10,
Related Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding Flash Ventures.
50 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations and Other Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into long-term agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments, which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components. These arrangements are included under “Purchase obligations and other commitments” in the table above. Mandatory Deemed Repatriation Tax The following is a summary of our estimated mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations that are payable in the following years:
December 30, 2022 (in millions) 2024 $ 199  2025 203  2026 255  Total $ 657  For additional information regarding our estimate of the total tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax, see Part II, Item 8, Note 13,
Income Tax Expense , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2019. Unrecognized Tax Benefits
As of December 30, 2022, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was $1.04 billion. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties included in our liability related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2022 was $279 million. Of these amounts, approximately $1.18 billion could result in potential cash payments.
As previously disclosed, the IRS issued statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances for years 2008 through 2015. In September 2018 and March 2019, we filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court covering years 2008 through 2012, for which we had received statutory notices of deficiency, while years 2013 through 2015 remain in the jurisdiction of the IRS’s Examination function. The IRS has filed various Amendments to Answer with the U.S. Tax Court which, together with the notices of proposed adjustments, would result in additional federal income tax liabilities totaling approximately $1.6 billion and penalties totaling $449 million with respect to years 2008 through 2015. In May 2022, we and the IRS tentatively reached a settlement for resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2008 through 2015 subject to the parties entering into final stipulations and a closing agreement. Based on the tentative settlement for resolution, we now expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $720 million to $760 million, which we expect to be partially offset by future reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions aggregating to approximately $100 million to $150 million. While we continue to work with the IRS to come to a final agreement on the federal tax and interest calculations, we are uncertain as to when a final agreement will be reached and the exact timing of when any payments will be made. However, we believe it is reasonably likely that these payments may be made within the next twelve months and we have classified that portion of these unrecognized tax benefits, including interest in Income taxes payable on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2022. This classification and amount may be subject to change in the next twelve months depending on when we are able to reach a final agreement with the IRS. Mandatory Research and Development Expense Capitalization Beginning in 2023, the 2017 Act requires us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred, which is expected to result in materially higher cash tax payments in future periods, if not repealed or otherwise modified. 51 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swap
We have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt and periodically have used interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our fixed rate debt. As of December 30, 2022, our only variable rate debt outstanding was our Term Loan A-2 on which we had pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $2 billion notional amount that would mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates on this loan only through February 2023. See Part I, Item 3,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
included in this in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. Foreign Exchange Contracts We purchase foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for Operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Part I, Item 3,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements, products or services to be provided by us, environmental compliance or from intellectual property (“IP”) infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, which authorization is effective through July 25, 2023. We did not make any stock repurchases during the six months ended December 30, 2022 and have not repurchased any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Although we will reevaluate the repurchasing of our common stock when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when or at what level we may resume such activity. The remaining amount available to be repurchased under our current stock repurchase program as of December 30, 2022 was $4.5 billion. Repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. 52 Table of Contents There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended July 1, 2022. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended July 1, 2022 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. In addition, as disclosed in Part I, Item 1, Note 3,
Business Segments, Geographic Information, and Concentrations of Risk , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of December 30, 2022, our management identified several factors that warranted a quantitative analysis of impairment for both the Flash and HDD reporting units as of that date. Please refer to that disclosure for additional information on the estimates included in our assessment. 53 Table of Contents Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to our market risk during the
six months ended
December 30, 2022 . See Part II, Item 7A,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2022 for further information about our exposure to market risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Due to macroeconomic changes and volatility experienced in the foreign exchange market recently, we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movement. Therefore, we have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse moveme nt in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts used to offset the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used in performing the sensitivity analyses were based on market rates in effect at
December 30, 2022
and July 1, 2022. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of
$342
million and $306 million at
December 30, 2022
and July 1, 2022, respectively. Interest Rate Risk We have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. As of December 30, 2022, our only variable rate debt outstanding was our Term Loan A-2, which bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (x) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or (y) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on the corporate family ratings of the Company from at least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc., with an initial interest rate of Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.375%.
As of December 30, 2022, the outstanding balance on our Term Loan A-2 was $2.7 billion and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by $27 million. We currently have pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $2 billion notional amount that would mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates only through February 2023. Item 4.     Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 54 Table of Contents PART II.
