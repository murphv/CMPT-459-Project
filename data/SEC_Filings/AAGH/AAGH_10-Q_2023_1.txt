These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are available to be issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company’s former majority shareholder sold his shares to an investor group. The new owners’ plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Company’s plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations.
Our cash needs for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily met by loans and advances from current majority shareholder. As of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $ 51,197 . We intend to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and advance from current majority shareholder.

Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services, debt and equity investment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.
In accordance with ASC 830, “Translation of Financial Statements” the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities booked and recorded at the non-US local functional currency are generally translated into USD for consolidation purposes, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary’s financial statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity.
The Company’s reporting currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary of US-China Mega Beauty Health Industry Development Co., LTD. maintains its books and records in its local currency. The Chinese Yuan (“RMB”), which is the functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.

The Company’s bank account in the United States is protected by FDIC insurance.
The Company’s bank account in the United States is protected by FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s bank account in the United States had $ 57

Revenues
Revenue from sale of goods under  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of the Company’s products and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:
●
executed contract(s) with customers that the Company believes is legally enforceable;
●
identification of performance obligation in the respective contract;
●
determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;
●
allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and
●
recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The Company sells health related products through wholesale and retailers. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales. The Company considers purchase orders to be a contract with a customer. Contracts with customers are considered to be short-term when the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of the performance obligations is equal to or less than one year, and virtually all of the Company’s contracts are short-term. The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations in contracts with customers upon shipment of the goods. The Company does not have any contract assets since the Company has an unconditional right to consideration when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and payment from customers is not contingent on a future event. Generally, payment is due from customers within 40 to 60 days of the invoice date, and the contracts do not have significant financing components nor variable consideration. Returns and allowances are not a significant aspect of the revenue recognition process as historically they have been immaterial. All of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and the transaction price is stated in the contract, usually as a price per unit. All estimates are based on the Company’s historical experience; complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, and the Company’s best judgment at the time the estimate is made. Historically, sales returns have not significantly impacted the Company’s revenue.

Product Revenue
A majority of the Company’s sales are for products sold at a point in time and shipped to customers, for which control is transferred to the customer as goods are delivered to the third-party carrier for shipment. The Company receives payment for the sale of products at the time customers place orders and payment is required prior to shipment. The Company does not recognize assets associated with costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.
Shipping and handling activities are performed upon delivery to the third-party carrier for shipment. The Company accounts for these activities as fulfillment costs. Therefore, the Company recognizes the costs of these activities when revenue for the goods is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not made provision for inventory in regards to slow moving or obsolete items. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, inventories amounted to $ 113,949  and $ 116,060 , respectively.
Equity Method Investments
We apply the equity method of accounting to investments when we have significant influence, but not controlling interest in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income (loss) resulting from these investments is reported under the line item captioned “equity investment” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of our equity method investments is reported in equity investment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s equity method investments are reported at cost and adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid, if any. The Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss is recorded on a one quarter lag for all equity method investments. The Company classifies distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. The Company recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its equity method investments during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions.
The Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort.
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature.
Loss per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company did not recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss” and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets and certain other instruments, including but not limited to available-for-sale debt securities. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. ASU 2016-13 requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates, which defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for all entities except SEC reporting companies that are not smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. The Company believes that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will impact account receivable, inventory, due from the related parties and property and equipment on its financial statements.
In July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II)”, which is the replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatory Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatory Redeemable Non-controlling Interests with a Scope Exception. The amendments in Part I of this Update that relate to the recognition, measurement, and earnings per share of certain freestanding equity-classified financial instruments that include down round features affect entities that present earnings per share in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not have an accounting effect. The amendments in Part I of the update are effective for fiscal year, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is assessing the impact to its accounting practices and financial reporting procedures as a result of the issuance of this standard.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or is not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss of $320,875, used cash to fund operating activities of $215,638 and at December 31, 2022, had a shareholders’ deficit of $4,160,544. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net loss of $2,132,330, used cash to fund operating activities of $611,810 and at June 30, 2022, had a shareholders’ deficit of $3,860,481. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company is raising the additional capital to achieve profitable operations.
Our cash needs for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily met by loans and advances from current majority shareholder. As of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $51,197. Our new majority shareholders will need to provide all of our working capitals going forward.
Primarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity, we received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2022 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Financial Position
As of December 31, 2022, we had $51,197 in cash, negative working capital of $2,640,508 and an accumulated deficit of $4,160,544. As of June 30, 2022, we had $62,643 in cash, negative working capital of $2,560,837 and an accumulated deficit of $3,860,481.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements (“CFS”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others, the fair value of shares of common stock issued for services. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Revenues
Revenue from sale of goods under  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of the Company’s products and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:
●
executed contract(s) with customers that the Company believes is legally enforceable;
●
identification of performance obligation in the respective contract;
●
determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;
●
allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and
●
recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not made provision for inventory in regards to slow moving or obsolete items. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, inventories amounted to $113,949 and $116,060, respectively.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions.
The Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort.
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature.

Table of Contents
Loss per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are not designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) a lack of accounting staff and resources with appropriate knowledge of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and SEC reporting and compliance requirements; (3) a lack of independent directors and (4) a lack of an effective review process by the accounting manager and management.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors’ results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.
