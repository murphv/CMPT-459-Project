Table of Contents Interim Financial Statements The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2022. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been omitted pursuant to the interim financial reporting rules and regulations of the SEC. The financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Energy Services include the accounts of Energy Services, its wholly owned subsidiaries West Virginia Pipeline, SQP, Ryan Construction, Tri-State Paving and C.J. Hughes and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Energy Services include Energy Services, West Virginia Pipeline, SQP, Ryan Construction, Tri-State Paving and C.J. Hughes and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and loss during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Please refer to Note 2 “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies. There were no material changes to these significant accounting policies during the three months ended December 31, 2022. ​ 3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION Our revenue is primarily derived from construction contracts that can span several quarters. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”) which provides for a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as follows: ● Identify the contract ● Identify performance obligations ● Determine the transaction price ● Allocate the transaction price ● Recognize revenue The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. We believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include: ● the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; ● costs associated with scope changes; ● changes in costs of labor and/or materials; ● extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays; ● subcontractor performance issues; 6
Table of Contents ● changes in productivity expectations; ● site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid; ● changes from original design on design-build projects; ● the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; ● a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials; ● our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and ● the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract. The foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit from period to period. Significant changes in cost estimates, particularly in our larger, more complex projects, could have a significant effect on our profitability. Our contract assets include cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings that represent amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts, including claim recovery estimates, but have a conditional right for billing and payment such as achievement of milestones or completion of the project. With the exception of customer affirmative claims, generally, such unbilled amounts will become billable according to the contract terms and generally will be billed and collected over the next three months. Settlement with the customer of outstanding affirmative claims is dependent on the claims resolution process and could extend beyond one year. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to billable amounts to be low. When events or conditions indicate that it is probable that the amounts outstanding become unbillable, the transaction price and associated contract asset is reduced. Our contract liabilities consist of provisions for losses and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Provisions for losses, if incurred, are recognized in the consolidated statements of income at the uncompleted performance obligation level for the amount of total estimated losses in the period that evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a performance obligation exceeds its estimated total revenue. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings are billings to customers on contracts in advance of work performed, including advance payments negotiated as a contract condition. Generally, unearned project-related costs will be earned over the next twelve months. ​ ​ 4.    DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE The Company disaggregates revenue based on the following lines of service: (1) Gas & Water Distribution, (2) Gas & Petroleum Transmission, and (3) Electrical, Mechanical, & General services and construction. Our contract types are: Lump Sum, Unit Price, Cost Plus and Time and Materials (“T&M”). The following tables present our disaggregated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Electrical, ​ ​

Most of the Company’s contracts have monthly billing terms; however, billing terms for some are based on project completion. Payment terms are generally within
30
to
45 days

of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and specifies disclosures about fair value measurements. Under the FASB’s authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement guidance of the FASB ASC establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1  — Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 2  — Observable inputs other than Level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 also includes derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with observable market inputs or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3  — Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation; also includes observable inputs for nonbinding single dealer quotes not corroborated by observable market data. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying amount for borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rate charged to the Company for these borrowings. The fair value of the Company’s long term fixed-rate debt was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis and a yield rate that was estimated based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s fixed-rate debt of $ 16.0
million at December 31, 2022 was $ 15.0
million. The fair value of the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s fixed-rate debt of $ 15.0
million at September 30, 2022 was $ 14.5
million. All other current assets and liabilities are carried at net realizable value which approximates fair value because of their short duration to maturity. ​ 9

4,455,079 ​ Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31, 2022, the Company expects all net operating loss carryforwards to be realized in the near future. The Company does not believe that it has any unrecognized tax benefits included in its consolidated financial statements that require recognition. The Company has not had any settlements in the current period with taxing authorities, nor has it recognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses. ​ The Company and all subsidiaries file a consolidated federal and various state income tax returns on a fiscal year basis. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations for years ended prior to September 30, 2018. ​ 11.  SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT Short-term debt consists of the following: On July 13, 2022, the Company received a one-year extension on its $ 15.0
million operating line of credit effective June 28, 2022. The interest rate on the line of credit is the
“ Wall Street Journal ” Prime Rate

4.99 %. The interest rate at December 31, 2022, was
7.75 %. The interest rate at September 30, 2022, was
5.5 %.
The line of credit has a $ 12.5
million component and a $ 2.5
million component with additional borrowing requirements. Based on the borrowing base calculation, the Company borrowed all $ 12.5
million available on the line of credit as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The Company did not meet the requirements to borrow any from the $ 2.5
million component. On January 19, 2023, the Company received an amendment to the agreement which increased the line of credit to $ 30.0
million.  The maturity date remains June 28, 2023, with a variable interest rate equal to the “Wall Street Journal” Prime Rate with a floor of
4.5 %. The modified financial covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and all subsequent quarters, are below: ● Minimum tangible net worth of
$ 28.0
million, ● Minimum traditional debt service coverage of
1.50x
on a rolling twelve- month basis, ● Minimum current ratio of
1.20x , ● Maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio (“TNW”) of
2.75x , ● Each ratio and covenant shall be determined, tested, and measured as of each calendar quarter beginning December 31, 2022, ● Borrower shall maintain a ratio of Maximum Senior Funded Debt ("SFD") to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBDITA") equal to or less than

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , which requires a company to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value. Under the current guidance, companies can first choose to assess any impairment based on qualitative factors (Step 0). If a company fails this test or decides to bypass this step, it must proceed with a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. The Company did not have a goodwill impairment at December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022.

These variations are the result of weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays. The first quarter of the calendar year is typically the slowest in terms of revenues because inclement weather conditions cause delays in production and customers usually do not plan large projects during that time. While usually better than the first quarter, the second calendar year quarter often has some inclement weather which can cause delays in production, reducing the revenues the Company receives and/or increasing the production costs. The third and fourth calendar year quarters usually are less impacted by weather and usually have the largest number of projects underway. Many projects are

Table of Contents completed in the fourth calendar year quarter and revenues are often impacted by customers seeking to either spend their capital budget for the year or scale back projects due to capital budget overruns. In addition to the fluctuations discussed above, the pipeline industry can be highly cyclical, reflecting variances in capital expenditures in proportion to energy price fluctuations. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by where our customers are in the cycle and thereby their financial condition as to their capital needs and access to capital to finance those needs.

The variable interest rate on the loan agreement is 8.75% at December 31, 2022 with monthly payments of $12,464. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had made principal payments of $746,000. The loan is collateralized by the building and property purchased under this agreement.
On December 31, 2020, West Virginia Pipeline Acquisition Company, later renamed West Virginia Pipeline, Inc., entered into a $3.0 million sellers’ note agreement with David and Daniel Bolton for the remaining purchase price of West Virginia Pipeline, Inc. For the purchase price allocation, the $3.0 million note had a fair value of $2.85 million. As part of the $6.35 million acquisition price, the Company paid $3.5 million in cash in addition to the note. The unsecured five-year term note requires annual payments of at least $500,000 with a fixed interest rate of 3.25% on the $3.0 million sellers’ note, which equates to 5.35% on the carrying value of the note. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had made annual installment payments of $1,250,000, interest payments of $172,000 and expensed $38,000 in accreted interest.
On January 4, 2021, the Company entered into a $3.0 million Non-Revolving Note agreement with United Bank. This five-year agreement gave the Company access to a $3.0 million line of credit (“Equipment Line of Credit 2021”), specifically for the purchase of equipment, for a period of twelve months with a variable interest rate initially established at 4.25% as based on the Prime Rate as published by
The Wall Street Journal.
After twelve months, all borrowings against the Equipment Line of Credit 2021 were converted to a four-year term note agreement with a variable interest rate initially established at 4.25%.

The lease, signed on March 25, 2021, is for a period of two years with five one-year renewals available immediately following the end of the base term. Rental terms for the option periods shall be negotiated and agreed mutually between the parties and shall not exceed five percent increases to rent, if any. The lease is expensed monthly and not treated as a right-to-use asset as it does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 24
Table of Contents Operating Leases The Company leases office space for SQP for $1,500 per month. The lease, signed on March 25, 2021, is for a period of two years with five one-year renewals available immediately following the end of the base term. Rental terms for the option periods shall be negotiated and agreed mutually between the parties and shall not exceed five percent increases to rent, if any. The Company has two lease agreements for construction equipment with a combined amount of $160,000. The leases have a term of twenty-two months with a stated interest rate of 0%, combined monthly installment payments of $6,645 and are cancellable at any time without penalty. The Company has the right to purchase the equipment at the expiration of the leases by applying the two-month deposit paid. The related assets and finance lease obligations associated with these lease agreements are included in the consolidated balance sheets within property, plant and equipment and long-term debt. The Company has two right-of-use operating leases acquired on April 29, 2022, as part of the Tri-State Paving, LLC transaction. The first operating lease, for the Hurricane, WV facility, had a net present value of $236,000 at April 29, 2022, and a carrying value of $186,000 at December 31, 2022. The second operating lease, for the Chattanooga, Tennessee facility, had a net present value of $144,000 at April 29, 2022, and a carrying value of $103,000 at December 31, 2022. The 4.5% interest rate on the operating leases is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at inception.
The Company has a right-of-use operating lease with Enterprise Fleet Management, Inc. acquired on August 11, 2022, as part of the Ryan Environmental acquisition. This lease agreement was initially for 31 vehicles to be used for Ryan Construction; however, the Company plans to add vehicles as it finds necessary. This lease had a net present value of $1.2 million at inception, and carrying value of $1.1 million at December 31, 2022. The 4.5% interest rate on the operating lease is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at inception.
The Company has a right-of-use operating lease with RICA Developers, LLC acquired on August 12, 2022, as part of the Ryan Environmental acquisition. This lease, for the Bridgeport, WV facility, had a net present value of $140,000 at inception and a carrying value of $83,000 at December 31, 2022. The 4.5% interest rate on the operating lease is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at inception. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Due to the nature of our industry, we often enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets.  Though for the most part not material in nature, some of these are: Rental Agreements The Company rents equipment for use on construction projects with rental agreements being week to week or month to month. Rental expense can vary by reporting period due to equipment requirements on construction projects and the availability of Company owned equipment. Rental expense, which is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income, was $2.7 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Letters of Credit Certain customers or vendors may require letters of credit to secure payments that the vendors are making on our behalf or to secure payments to subcontractors and vendors on various customer projects.  At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any letters of credit outstanding.
Performance Bonds Some customers, particularly new ones or governmental agencies require the Company to post bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds (collectively, performance bonds). These performance bonds are obtained through insurance carriers and guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If the Company fails to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the insurer make payments or provide services under the bond. The Company must reimburse the insurer for any expenses or outlays it is required to make.
25
Table of Contents Currently, the Company has an agreement with a surety company to provide bonding which will suit the Company’s immediate needs. The ability to obtain bonding for future contracts is an important factor in the contracting industry with respect to the type and value of contracts that can be bid. Depending upon the size and conditions of a particular contract, the Company may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the insurer. Posting of these letters or other collateral will reduce our borrowing capabilities. The Company does not anticipate any claims in the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $79.0 million in performance bonds outstanding. Concentration of Credit Risk In the ordinary course of business, the Company grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include natural gas and oil companies, general contractors, and various commercial and industrial customers located within the United States. Consequently, the Company is subject to potential credit risk related to business and economic factors that would affect these companies. However, the Company generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosure, the Company may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables.

The lawsuit is related to a dispute over work performed on a pipeline construction project. On November 21, 2022, a Judgment Order was issued, and the Company was awarded $13.1 million, of which $5.8 million was the jury award, $1.6 million was for attorney’s fees, and $5.7 million was for penalties and interest. The amounts awarded by the Judgment Order have not been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s attorney’s fees have been expensed as incurred. On December 16, 2022, the Defendant filed a notice of appeal with the court.
On November 12, 2021, the Company received a withdrawal liability claim from a pension plan to which the Company made pension contributions for union construction employees performing covered work in a particular jurisdiction. The Company has not performed covered work in their jurisdiction since 2011; however, the Company disagrees with the withdrawal claim and believes it is covered by an exemption under federal law. The demand called for thirty-four quarterly installment payments of $41,000 starting December 15, 2021. The Company must comply with the demand under federal pension law; however, the Company firmly believes no withdrawal liability exists. The Company is in negotiations with the pension fund to resolve the matter and all future payments have been suspended as part of the negotiation. The Company has expensed all $164,000 in payments made through December 31, 2022 and does not expect any future liabilities related to this claim. 26
Table of Contents Other than described above, at December 31, 2022, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings other than in the ordinary course of business. The Company is a party from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2022, the Company does not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Related Party Transactions We intend that all transactions between us and our executive officers, directors, holders of 10% or more of the shares of any class of our common stock and affiliates thereof, will be on terms no less favorable than those terms given to unaffiliated third parties and will be approved by a majority of our independent outside directors not having any interest in the transaction.
On December 16, 2014, the Company’s Nitro subsidiary entered into a 20-year $1.2 million loan agreement with First Bank of Charleston, Inc. (West Virginia) to purchase the office building and property it had previously been leasing for $6,300 each month. The interest rate on the loan agreement is 4.82% with monthly payments of $7,800. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had paid approximately $346,000 in principal and approximately $404,000 in interest since the beginning of the loan. Mr. Douglas Reynolds, President of Energy Services, was a director and secretary of First Bank of Charleston. Mr. Samuel Kapourales, a director of Energy Services, was also a director of First Bank of Charleston. On October 15, 2018, First Bank of Charleston was merged into Premier Bank, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. Mr. Marshall Reynolds, Chairman of the Board of Energy Services, held the same position with Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. Mr. Douglas Reynolds is the president and a director of Energy Services and was a director of Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. On September 17, 2021, Peoples Bancorp, Inc., parent company of Peoples Bank, completed an acquisition of Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Premier Bank and Citizens Deposit Bank & Trust. On October 26, 2021, Mr. Douglas Reynolds was elected a director of Peoples Bancorp, Inc., and its subsidiary Peoples Bank.
On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into a $1.0 million promissory note agreement with Corns Enterprises as partial consideration for the purchase of Tri-State Paving. This four-year agreement requires $250,000 principal installment payments on or before the end of each twelve (12) full calendar month period beginning April 29, 2022. Interest payments due shall be calculated on the principal balance remaining and shall be at the stated rate of 3.5% per year. Subsequent to the April 29, 2022 acquisition of Tri-State Paving, the Company entered into an operating lease for facilities in Hurricane, West Virginia with Corns Enterprises. This thirty-six-month lease is treated as a right to use asset and has payments of $7,000 per month. The total net present value at inception was $236,000 with a carrying value of $186,000 at December 31, 2022. SQP made an equity investment of $156,000 in 1030 Quarrier Development, LLC (“Development”) in August 2022. Development is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that is 75% owned by 1030 Quarrier Ventures, LLC (“Ventures”) and 25% owned by SQP. SQP is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore, will not consolidate Development into its consolidated financial statements. Instead, SQP will apply the equity method of accounting for its investment in Development. Development, a 1% owner, and United Bank, a 99% owner, formed 1030 Quarrier Landlord, LLC (“Landlord”). Landlord decided to pursue the following development project (the “Project”): a historical building at 1030 Quarrier Street, Charleston, West Virginia as well as associated land (the “Property”) was purchased to be developed/rehabilitated into a commercial project including apartments and commercial space. Upon the completion of development, the Property will be used to generate rental income. SQP has been awarded the construction contract for the Project. United Bank provided $5.0 million in loans to fund the Project. SQP and Ventures has jointly provided an unconditional guarantee for the $5.0 million of obligations associated with the Project.
Other than mentioned above, there were no new material related party transactions entered into during the three months December 31, 2022. Certain Energy Services subsidiaries routinely engage in transactions in the normal course of business with each other, including sharing employee benefit plan coverage, payment for insurance and other expenses on behalf of other affiliates, and other services incidental to business of each of the affiliates. All revenue and related expense transactions, as well as the related accounts payable and accounts receivable have been eliminated in consolidation. 27
Table of Contents Inflation Most significant project materials, such as pipe or electrical wire, are provided by the Company’s customers. When possible, the Company attempts to lock in pricing with vendors and include qualifications regarding material costs increases in bids. Where allowed by contract, the Company will address fuel cost increases with customers. Significant inflation or supply chain issues could cause customers to delay or cancel planned projects; however, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management believes the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenues The Company recognizes revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and control of the promised good and service is transferred to the customer. For Lump Sum and Unit Price contracts, revenue is ordinarily recognized over time as control is transferred to the customers by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation(s) using an input (i.e., “cost to cost”) method. For Cost Plus and Time and Material (“T&M”) contracts, revenue is ordinarily recognized over time as control is transferred to the customers by measuring the progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation(s) using an output method. The Company also does certain T&M service work that is generally completed in a short duration and is recognized at a point in time. The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. We believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include: ● the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; ● costs associated with scope changes; ● changes in costs of labor and/or materials; ● extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays; ● subcontractor performance issues; ● changes in productivity expectations; ● site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid; ● changes from original design on design-build projects; ● the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; ● a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials; ● our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and ● the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract. 28
Table of Contents The foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit from period to period. Significant changes in cost estimates, particularly in our larger, more complex projects could have, a significant effect on our profitability. Our contract assets include cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings that represent amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts, including claim recovery estimates, but have a conditional right for billing and payment such as achievement of milestones or completion of the project. With the exception of customer affirmative claims, generally, such unbilled amounts will become billable according to the contract terms and generally will be billed and collected over the next three months. Settlement with the customer of outstanding affirmative claims is dependent on the claims resolution process and could extend beyond one year. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to billable amounts to be low. When events or conditions indicate that it is probable that the amounts outstanding become unbillable, the transaction price and associated contract asset is reduced. Our contract liabilities consist of provisions for losses and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Provisions for losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of income at the uncompleted performance obligation level for the amount of total estimated losses in the period that evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a performance obligation exceeds its estimated total revenue. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings are billings to customers on contracts in advance of work performed, including advance payments negotiated as a contract condition. Generally, unearned project-related costs will be earned over the next twelve months. The following table presents our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      September 30, 2022 Costs incurred on contracts in progress ​ $

10,082,015 ​ Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account is considered doubtful. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates relating to, among others, our customers’ access to capital, our customers’ willingness or ability to pay, general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customers. While most of our customers are large well capitalized companies, should they experience material changes in their revenues and cash flows or incur other difficulties and not be able to pay the amounts owed, this could cause reduced cash flows and losses in excess of our current reserves. Materially incorrect estimates of bad debt reserves could result in an unexpected loss in profitability for the Company. Additionally, frequently changing reserves could be an indication of risky or unreliable customers. At December 31, 2022, the management review deemed that the allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate. 29

70,310 ​ Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Company follows the guidance of ASC Topic 350,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , which requires a company to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value. Under the current guidance, companies can first choose to assess any impairment based on qualitative factors (Step 0). If a company fails this test or decides to bypass this step, it must proceed with a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. The Company did not have a goodwill impairment at December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. Materially incorrect estimates could cause an impairment to goodwill or intangible assets and result in a loss in profitability for the Company.

3,740,910 ​ Depreciation and Amortization The purpose of depreciation and amortization is to represent an accurate value of assets on the books. Every year, as assets are used, their values are reduced on the balance sheet and expensed on the income statement. As depreciation and amortization are a noncash expense, the amount must be estimated. Each year a certain amount of depreciation and amortization is written off and the book value of the asset is reduced.
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Costs which extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are capitalized, while normal repairs and maintenance that do not extend the useful life or increase productivity of the asset are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings 39 years; operating equipment and vehicles 5-7 years; and office equipment, furniture and fixtures 5-7 years. Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefit of the respective intangible assets is realized, over their respective estimated useful lives. The definite-lived identifiable intangible assets recognized as part of the Company’s business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value. 30
Table of Contents The Company’s depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. In general, depreciation is included in “cost of revenues” on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The Company’s intangible amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $133,000 and $119,000, respectively. In general, amortization is included in “selling and administrative expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Materially incorrect estimates of depreciation and amortization and/or the useful lives of assets could significantly impact the value of long-lived assets on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. A material over valuation could result in impairment charges and reduced profitability for the Company. Income Taxes The Company’s income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. The Company’s provision for income taxes is computed by applying a federal rate of 21.0% and a state rate of 6.0% to taxable income or loss after consideration of non-taxable and non-deductible items. Permanent income tax differences result in an increase or decrease to taxable income and impact the Company’s effective tax rates, which were (94.9%) and 29.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as non-deductible expenses, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a net deferred income tax liability of $4.0 million as compared to $4.5 million at September 30, 2022. The Company’s deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2022 totaled $7.7 million and primarily related to depreciation on property and equipment. The Company’s deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2022, totaled $3.7 million and primarily related to a NOL carryforward. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that all NOL carryforwards will be realized. New Accounting Pronouncements On October 28, 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) released Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”. The amendments of this ASU require entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The amendments improve comparability after the business combination by providing consistent recognition and measurement guidance for revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination and revenue contracts with customers not acquired in a business combination. The amendments are effective for public business entities for the fiscal years, including interim periods within those the fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. For all other entities they are effective for the fiscal years, including interim periods within those the fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023. Entities should apply the amendments prospectively to business combinations that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted, including in any interim period, for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued, and for all other entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company is currently assessing the effect that ASU 2021-08 will have on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows; however, the Company does not expect a significant impact. The FASB recently issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance”, which aims to provide increased transparency by requiring business entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive in the notes to the financial statements. Entities are required to provide the new disclosures prospectively for all transactions with a government entity that are accounted for under either a grant or a contribution accounting model and are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initially applying the new amendments, and to new transactions entered into after that date. Retrospective application of the guidance is permitted. The guidance in ASU 2021-10 is effective for financial statements of all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early application permitted. ASU 2021-10 has not become effective for the Company; however, a significant impact is not expected. 31

“Wall Street Journal”
Prime Rate with a floor of 4.5%. Management has evaluated all subsequent events for accounting and disclosure. There have been no other material events during the period, other than noted above, that would either impact the results reflected in the report or the Company’s results going forward. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. ​ The Company is seeing a significant increase in bid opportunities for natural gas transmission and distribution projects along with electrical, mechanical, and general construction projects.  The Company’s backlog at December 31, 2022, was $206.9 million, as compared to $101.6 million and $142.3 million at December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2022, respectively.  While adding additional projects appears likely, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in bidding on projects that become available.  Moreover, even if the Company obtains contracts, there can be no guarantee that the projects will go forward.
​ ITEM 3. Quantitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for a smaller reporting company. ​ ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Energy Services of America Corporation files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There has been no change in Energy Services of America Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting during Energy Services of America Corporation’s first quarter of fiscal year 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Energy Services of America Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. ​ 32
Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings In February 2018, the Company filed a lawsuit against a former customer (“Defendant”) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The lawsuit is related to a dispute over work performed on a pipeline construction project. On November 21, 2022, a Judgment Order was issued, and the Company was awarded $13.1 million, of which $5.8 million was the jury award, $1.6 million was for attorney’s fees, and $5.7 million was for penalties and interest. The amounts awarded by the Judgment Order have not been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s attorney’s fees have been expensed as incurred. On December 16, 2022, the Defendant filed a notice of appeal with the court.
On November 12, 2021, the Company received a withdrawal liability claim from a pension plan to which the Company made pension contributions for union construction employees performing covered work in a particular jurisdiction. The Company has not performed covered work in their jurisdiction since 2011; however, the Company disagrees with the withdrawal claim and believes it is covered by an exemption under federal law. The demand called for thirty-four quarterly installment payments of $41,000 starting December 15, 2021. The Company must comply with the demand under federal pension law; however, the Company firmly believes no withdrawal liability exists. The Company is in negotiations with the pension fund to resolve the matter and all future payments have been suspended as part of the negotiation. The Company has expensed all $164,000 in payments made through December 31, 2022 and does not expect any future liabilities related to this claim. Other than described above, at December 31, 2022, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings other than in the ordinary course of business. The Company is a party from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2022, the Company does not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
