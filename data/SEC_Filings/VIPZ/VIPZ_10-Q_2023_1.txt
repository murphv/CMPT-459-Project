NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022
NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION & SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Overview
KeyStar Corp. (the “Company,” “we”, “us” and “our”) was incorporated on April 16, 2020, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as KeyStar Corp. The wholly-owned subsidiary was formed on December 21, 2021, under the State of Nevada, as UG Acquisition Sub, Inc.
Prior to September 15, 2022, our business consisted of the retail sale of masks and similar products, and convention services (together, the “Prior Business”). Through our e-commerce sales channel, we sold KN-95 facemasks, disposable facemasks, and disinfectant wipes through an online store in the United States of America. Through our convention sales channel, we offered convention services, which connect US buyers to Chinese manufacturers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional conventions were postponed in the United States. Accordingly, our convention services had been intended to offer online (or virtual) convention services to potential customers. However, as a result of the commencement of the lifting of many travel restrictions, we adjusted our convention services from coordinating virtual conventions to focusing on certain traditional on-site convention services. Through our KeyStarCorp.com website, we offered trade show booth staffing, trade show booth design, manufacturing, and turn-key trade show booths.
As of June 15, 2022, we hired a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer along with certain key employees of ZenSports, Inc. to explore business opportunities related to software and mobile application development and services related to such technology. On August 26, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to purchase certain technological assets from ZenSports, Inc. The assets were purchased to allow us to offer gambling and entertainment opportunities through technology principally the online gaming technology and use of the name ZenSports. We did not acquire all the assets of the Company, the assets we didn’t purchase include, among other assets, ZenSport’s legal entity name “ZenSports, Inc.” and those assets related to ZenSports’ physical casino called the Big Wheel Casino, located in Lovelock, Nevada. See Notes 4, 5, and 10.
On September 12, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement between the Company and Excel Members, LLC (“Excel”), a company controlled by Bruce Cassidy, the chairman of our board of directors, to acquire certain assets of Excel a company of which a Company controlled by Mr. Cassidy is the manager, and effectively has a controlling interest. Excel acquired certain assets of a company, Ultimate Gamer, LLC, which was formerly an Esports tournament company, through the assignment for the benefit of the creditor’s court process. See Notes 4, 5, and 10.
On September 15, 2022, we executed an assignment and assumption agreement whereby we assigned our e-commerce sales channel and the convention services operating assets to TopSight Corporation (“TopSight”), a company owned by our former Chief Financial Officer Zixiao Chen, effectively discontinuing our historical operations.
After the foregoing transactions, we have effectively ceased our Prior Business operations and assembled a comprehensive platform capability that enables both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer offerings within the online sports betting, eSports, and fintech/digital currency markets. The platform is targeted at global business opportunities and has been designed as a flexible foundation for corporate growth.
Effective January 10, 2023, Mr. John Linss (“ Linss ”) resigned as a member of the Company’s board of directors (“Board”) and as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Executive Officer, President, and Chief Technology Officer pursuant to the terms of a Separation Agreement and Release dated the same date.
On January 10, 2023, the Board appointed Mark Thomas as the new Chief Executive Officer, Principal Executive Officer, President, and Chief Technology Officer
of the Company. Prior to accepting the new position Mr. Thomas was Company’s Chief Product Officer and was the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of ZenSports, Inc.
F-7
As part of the change in Chief Executive Officers the Board and Mr. Thomas laid out a plan to change the Company’s business focus from the aforementioned comprehensive platform capability that enables both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer offerings within the online sports betting, eSports, and fintech/digital currency markets. To a singular focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) sports betting in one targeted jurisdiction, Tennessee, for up to a two-year period.  Management is in the process of finalizing and executing the change in business focus. See note 15.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 4,641,334
as of December 31, 2022. The Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $ 3,109,647
and negative cash flows of $ 2,171,262
from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Our independent auditors, in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement its business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its initial operations by securing a related party line of credit, issuing preferred stock, and issuing common stock through private placements.
F-8
We cannot be certain that capital will be provided when it is required or in amounts sufficient to meet our operating requirements. Management believes the existing shareholders, the prospective new investors, and future sales will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due and will allow the development of its core business operations. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.
Cash and Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts deposited in financial institutions in excess of insurable Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) limits. At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of December 31, 2022, the cash balance did not exceed the FDIC limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts.
Inventory
Historically inventory was carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company established reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on the estimated reserve percentage, which considers historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. When the Company disposed of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals were charged against the inventory reserve. On September 15, 2022, the remaining balance of inventory was assigned to TopSight, a company owned by Ms. Chen, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer. See Note 2.
Equipment
Equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life. The capitalization policy for the company is to capitalize equipment purchases greater than $1,000. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When retired or otherwise disposed of, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from the disposition is reflected in earnings. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Business intellectual property
Business intellectual property is principally related to technological assets acquired through Asset Purchase Agreements and is carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Business intellectual property is included in intangible assets on the balance sheet. When retired or otherwise disposed of, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from the disposition is reflected in earnings. As of December 31, 2022, business intellectual property had not been placed in service and as such there was no depreciation during the period. See Note 4.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Business intellectual property
3 years
At December 31, 2022, the Company acquired definite-lived intangible assets consisting of goodwill and trademarks.
Digital assets
Digital assets are carried at cost and are principally comprised of our SPORTS utility token and various Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICX, and, USDT, with indefinite useful lives. The Company identifies the lowest traded value per currency in a fiscal quarter and if the value is lower than the recorded value we record a permanent impairment at that time. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized.
Gaming licenses
Certain costs, generally legal and professional fees, are required to attain jurisdictional gaming licenses in order to legally operate our core sports betting business. Gaming licenses, with indefinite useful lives, are tested at least on an annual basis as to the assets that have been impaired. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized.  Annual gaming license fees and legal and professional fees required to maintain the licenses are recorded as period costs in the statement of operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill is carried at cost and is principally related to business intellectual assets acquired, with indefinite useful lives. The Company tests at least on an annual basis whether with indefinite useful lives is impaired. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized.
Trademarks
Trademarks are carried at cost and are mainly related to branding and promotion, with indefinite useful lives. The Company tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks with indefinite useful lives are impaired. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized.
The Company conducts its annual impairment tests at June 30 of each year or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2022, management determined there was no impairment identified for any trademarks with indefinite useful lives.
Lease Commitments
The Company has no long-term lease commitments. Effective January 10, 2023, The Company moved its headquarters to Miami Florida. As part of the move effective January 1, 2023, the Company assumed the office lease of a related party, ZenSports, Inc.  The lease expires on September 30, 2023, and has a minimum monthly lease payment of $6,500.
The Company rented office space for its former corporate headquarters in Las Vegas Nevada on a month-to-month lease for $ 1,700
per month. The Las Vegas lease was terminated effective January 31, 2023. Prior to
F-10
September 15, 2022, the company rented a storage facility for its inventory on a variable month-to-month lease agreement, rents ranged from $58 to $123 per month.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company recognized the fair value of financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, “Fair Value Measurements”, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard also expands disclosures about instruments measured at fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
As of December 31, 2022, the balances reported for cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, related party notes payable, and related party line of credit approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.
The Company has had no transfers between levels of its assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2022.
Players Balances
The player’s balances are comprised of sports betting deposits (when the company is operating its sports betting app) and eSports and other contest winnings. The balances are comprised of our SPORTS utility token and various Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICX, USDT, and USD. We fair market value each currency to the closing market value on the last day of each fiscal quarter. Gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which consists of five steps to evaluating contracts with customers for revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation.
Revenue recognition for our Prior Business occurred at the time we satisfy a service performance obligation to our customers or when control of product transfers to customers upon shipment, provided there are no material remaining performance obligations required of the Company or any matters of customer acceptance. We only recorded revenue when collectability was probable. All payments are received upon order of services and prior to delivery of the product, so we have no accounts receivable.
The Company’s Prior Busines was providing quality merchandise through its former online store in the United States of America. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was focusing on providing disposable face masks and KN-95 face masks at affordable prices. Customers ordered and paid for the products through the online store, when the Company confirmed the order and payment, the Company delivered the product through common carriers, at which point the Company recognized revenue, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recorded actual sales returns when the customers return the products. The transaction price has not been affected by returns based as the Company did have significant returns.
F-11
All prior business operations, including sales and revenues, are included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the statement of operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized e-commerce sales of products $- 0 - and, $ 2,400 , and Convention services revenues of $- 0 - and $ 35,490
respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized e-commerce sales of products $- 0 - and, $ 9,542 , and Convention services revenues of $- 0 - and $ 35,490
respectively. See note 14.
For the three and the six months that ended December 31, 2022, there were no revenues from our continuing operations. Revenues from operations are not expected to commence until we have been approved for a gaming license and have begun Sport Betting operations. During February 2023 we submitted our sports betting gaming application in Tennessee and are awaiting approval. We expect to generate revenues from our sports betting mobile app offerings within 1 to 2 months after we receive license approval. See note 15.
Cost of Revenues
Costs of revenues from our Prior Business primarily consisted of outsourced vendors for both types of revenues. The Company includes product costs (i.e., material, direct labor, and overhead costs) and shipping and handling expenses in cost of revenues. All prior business operations, including costs of revenues s, are included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the statement of operations. See Note 14.
There are currently no costs of revenues associated with our continuing operations.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on the Company’s balance sheet in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The Company must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent, the Company believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in the Company’s valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the statements of operations.
ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, the Company recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are determined by dividing the net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic EPS calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding under the treasury stock method. As of December 31, 2022, there were
20,547,070
potentially dilutive shares that need to be considered as common share equivalents and because of the net loss, the effect of these potential common shares is anti-dilutive.
F-12
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a potential impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.

ZenSports is in the business of offering gambling and entertainment opportunities through technology and a physical casino. The Company purchased a portion of ZenSports’ assets, principally the online gaming technology and use of the name ZenSports. The assets we didn’t purchase include, among other assets, ZenSport’s legal entity name “ZenSports, Inc.” and those assets related to ZenSports’ physical casino called the Big Wheel Casino, located in Lovelock, Nevada.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the APA, the aggregate purchase price paid to ZenSports consisted of cash in the amount of $ 481,194 ; cash in the amount of $ 1,030,593

additional shares of our common stock subject to set off or recoupment by us until August 25, 2023, in connection with any indemnified losses we may incur pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the “Holdback Stock,” and together with the Stock Consideration, the “Transaction Shares”).
In connection with the Transaction and issuance of the Transaction Shares, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with ZenSports (together with any other party that may become a party to the Registration Rights Agreement, “Holders”).

Cash payments for ZenSports, Inc. pursuant to the APA and related financings:
In connection with the Transaction, on August 31, 2022, we paid an aggregate of $1,000,000 in bonuses to Key Persons (the “Bonuses”) as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement (APA). To pay part of the Bonuses, we borrowed an additional $ 735,120
under the related party LOC and we used proceeds from the $750,000 Private Offering to pay the remaining amount of the Bonuses and the employer portion of payroll taxes owed as a result of the Bonuses.

The fair
F-14

Effective January 10, 2023, John Linss, our former Chief Executive Officer and former member of our board of directors resigned.  As part of the separation agreement and release as of that date, the Parties agreed that Mr. Linss through his ownership of CoreSpeed, LLC has rights set forth in the Award Agreement concerning the restricted preferred series C convertible stock that the Parties will consider Linss’s resignation a Vesting Acceleration Event of the restricted series C convertible stock.

Linss and CoreSpeed, LLC, as part of the above-noted separation and release agreement, have agreed to sell and KeyStar has agreed to purchase all of the Subject Shares for a total of $ 2,000,000
pursuant to the terms of definitive agreements which the Parties agree to promptly negotiate and cause to be prepared in good faith. See notes 1,12, 13 and 15.
On January 10, 2023, the Board appointed Mark Thomas (“Thomas”) as the new Chief Executive Officer appointment. In lieu of an employment agreement, Thomas received a written offer letter (the “Offer”) that states he will receive an annual salary of $ 380,000 , and he is eligible to participate in the Company’s benefit plans. Furthermore, by February 1, 2023, the Board will set milestones with incentive compensation (in either annual salary increases or bonuses) in such amounts that, if all of the milestones are met, Thomas’ total annual compensation will reach $500,000 or more.
On February 1, 2023, the Board of Directors approved certain incentives not previously specified in Mr. Thomas’ January 10, 2023 offer letter.  See notes 1 and 15.
As part of the change in Chief Executive officers the Board and Mr. Thomas laid out a plan to change the Company’s business focus from the previous comprehensive platform capability that enables both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer offerings within the online sports betting, eSports, and fintech/digital currency markets. To a singular focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) sports betting in one targeted jurisdiction, Tennessee, for up to a two-year period.  Management is in the process of finalizing and executing the change in business focus.
During February 2023 we submitted our sports betting gaming application in Tennessee, including our proprietary peer-to-peer sports betting feature. We are awaiting approval which can take up to three months or more.  Once approved we can commence live sports betting and commence the revenue process.
The Company maintains a non-revolving line of credit demand note with Excel Family Partners, LLLP a company controlled by Bruce Cassidy (our former Chief Executive Officer through June 14, 2022) the Chairman of our board of directors with a $2,000,000 credit limit. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company exceeded the $2,000,000 principal borrowing limit by an aggregate additional borrowing total of $ 1,037,624 . Excel Family Partners, LLLP verbally committed to funding the Company’s operating cash requirements in good faith while the parties finalize negotiations of amended demand note agreement. The amendment is expected to be finalized by the end of February 2022.  See Notes 4, 10, and 13.

Overview
KeyStar Corp. (the “Company,” “we”, “us” and “our”) was incorporated on April 16, 2020, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as KeyStar Corp. The wholly-owned subsidiary was formed on December 21, 2021, under the State of Nevada, as UG Acquisition Sub, Inc.
KeyStar Corp., through its Zensports branded offerings is a Sports wagering operator that offers traditional sports book plus peer-to-peer wagering through its ZenSports mobile platform. The Zensports platform offers a traditional sports book where customers can bet against the house, as well as a peer-to-peer sports betting marketplace. With ZenSports’ peer-to-peer marketplace, customers can create their own bets with their own odds and terms. Peer-to-peer bets can be shared with friends or via the app’s mobile two-sided marketplace, right from their phone.
Prior to September 15, 2022, our business consisted of the retail sale of masks and similar products, and convention services (together, “Prior Business”). Through our e-commerce sales channel, we sold KN-95 facemasks, disposable facemasks, and disinfectant wipes through an online store in the United States of America. Through our convention sales channel, we offered convention services, which connect US buyers to Chinese manufacturers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional conventions were postponed in the United States. Accordingly, our convention services had been intended to offer online (or virtual) convention services to potential customers. However, as a result of the commencement of the lifting of many travel restrictions, we adjusted our convention services from coordinating virtual conventions to focusing on certain traditional on-site convention services. Through our KeyStarCorp.com website, we offered trade show booth staffing, trade show booth design, manufacturing, and turn-key trade show booths. The above is collectively described as our historical operations.
On August 26, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to purchase certain technological assets from ZenSports, Inc. The assets were purchased to allow us to offer gambling and entertainment opportunities through technology, principally the online gaming technology and use of the name ZenSports. We did not acquire all the assets of the Company, the assets we didn’t purchase include, among other assets, ZenSport’s legal entity name “ZenSports, Inc.” and those assets related to ZenSports’ physical casino called the Big Wheel Casino, located in Lovelock, Nevada. These technological assets now comprise the underlying technology in our Sports wagering operator business through ZenSports mobile platform.

On September 12, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Excel Members, LLC (“Excel”), a company controlled by Bruce Cassidy, the chairman of our board of directors, to acquire certain assets of Excel a company of which a Company controlled by Mr. Cassidy is the manager, and effectively has a controlling interest. Excel acquired certain assets of a company, Ultimate Gamer, LLC, which was formerly an Esports tournament company, through the assignment for the benefit of the creditor’s court process.
On September 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement to assign all of the Prior Business’ rights, including certain of its assets and liabilities, to TopSight Corporation (“TopSight”), a company owned by Zixiao Chen, our former Chief Financial Officer until her resignation effective December 17, 2021. TopSight’s services were terminated concurrently.
As a result of the foregoing transactions, we have effectively ceased operations relating to our Prior Business and commenced operations relating to both B2B and B2C offerings within online sports betting, eSports, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) fintech (collectively, “New Business”). With our New Business, augmented by net new development of products and services, we intend to pursue global business opportunities through a platform we’ve designed to be a flexible foundation for corporate growth.
Through our ZenSports brand, we will be offering a modern, full-featured, native mobile, and global online sports betting platform incorporating a sports book, peer-to-peer betting, fiat ($, €, £, ¥, etc.), and digital currency for betting, eSports wagering, loyalty, and player retention.
Through our Ultimate Gamer brand, we expect to offer a modern, full-featured mobile and PC-based eSports tournament management platform designed to improve the overall experience and reduce digital friction for the 3.24 billion gamers that seek the ability to curate their online gaming experience in a personalized manner.
Through our Burstive brand, we expect to offer comprehensive financial services utilizing a DeFi backbone that will incorporate a blockchain-based digital currency and marketplace infrastructure. Burstive is integrated with our ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer brands, and together they provide differentiation in their respective markets and a foundation for success for white-label partners in online sports betting, eSports, e-commerce, and financial services.
Effective January 10, 2023, Mr. John Linss (“Linss”) resigned as a member of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) and as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Executive Officer, President, and Chief Technology Officer pursuant to the terms of a Separation Agreement and Release dated the same date.
On January 10, 2023, the Board appointed Mark Thomas as the new Chief Executive Officer, Principal Executive Officer, President, and Chief Technology Officer of the Company. Prior to accepting the new position Mr. Thomas was Company’s Chief Product Officer and was the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of ZenSports, Inc.
As part of the change in Chief Executive Officers, the Board and Mr. Thomas laid out a plan to change the Company’s business focus from the aforementioned comprehensive platform capability that enables both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer offerings within the online sports betting, eSports, and fintech/digital currency markets. Currently, we are not pursuing a global licensing strategy for obtaining online gaming licenses and a go-to-market strategy to monetize our assets. As a result of the above change in leadership and per communications with the Board, we have repositioned our business model to a singular focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) sports betting in one targeted jurisdiction, Tennessee, for up to a two-year period.  Management is in the process of finalizing and executing the change in business focus.
Being a start-up company, our Prior Business had limited revenues and limited operating history. Our New Business continues in a start-up mode as we aggregate our recent asset acquisitions and continue the development of our comprehensive platform capability. At present, we have submitted the full application for approval to the Tennessee Sports Wagering Advisory Counsel (SWAC) for approval. We believe we can be licensed in as quickly as three months and continue to work directly with SWAC, legal counsel and internally to build out our platform’s capabilities in order to facilitate and expedite the licensing process in order to monetize our assets. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to raise funds in order to support our strategic organic growth.

Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022, and 2021
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of $1,707,972 and $839,780, respectively, and net income (loss) from discontinued operations of $0 and $5,884, respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of $3,109,647 and $864,347, respectively, and net income (loss) from discontinued operations of $(9,380) and $6,776, respectively.
For the three and six months that ended December 31, 2022, there were no revenues from our continuing operations. Revenues from continuing operations are not expected to commence until we have been approved for gaming licensing and have begun Sports Betting operations. In February 2023, we applied for a gaming license in Tennessee. We expect the license to be approved and to commence generating revenues in Tennessee within three to six months.
The significant driver to our losses is principally related to salary, wages, and contracting fees to ready our acquired technology for operating in Tennessee. In addition, legal, professional and jurisdictional licensing fees associated with our licensing activities in Tennessee and legal fees associated with fundraising.  Licensing costs all contribute to our losses and are expected to increase over the coming months as we get closer to securing a gaming license and launching our sports betting operations.
During the three and six months that ended December 31, 2022, we closed on the two above-noted acquisitions and spun off our Prior Business. We funded these activities by securing funding of $650,000 for the issuance of 2,166,665 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, an aggregate of $1,430,000 from the issuance of 1,430,000 of our common stock from private placements, and from an increase in our related party demand line of credit from $250,000 to $2,000,000 on which we drew down $1,749,126 in principal borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts payable and accrued expenditures, and capital expenditures, including the costs associated with internally developed software and attaining Gaming licenses.
As of December 31, 2022, we had total current assets of $132,245 and total current liabilities of $3,309,374, and a total working capital deficit of $(3,177,429). Net cash used in operating activities increased by $2,135,959 during the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is principally the result of the increase in a net loss of $2,261,456, a $824,968 increase in operating assets and liabilities offset by a one-time reduction of $821,307 non-cash loss on extinguisment of debt and an increase in non-cash related party compensation of $111,240.
The increase in net loss is primarily a result of our transitioning from our Prior Business to our New Business which resulted in a $3,3037,623 increase in operating expenses, offset by a reduction in other expenses of $729,324. The increase in operating expenses is principally comprised of an increase in salaries and wages of $2,051,908, operating expenses of $293,939, sales and marketing expenses of $130,277 and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $559,859. The increase in general and administrative is principally comprised of legal and professional fees associated with our asset acquisitions, fundraising, licensing, and other legal and professional costs associated with our transition from our Prior Business to our New Business.
4
The reduction in operating expenses is principally the result of a one-time non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $821,307 for the comparable prior reporting period compared to $0 in the current reporting period.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,856,806 during the six months that ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is principally the result of the acquisition of certain assets of ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer, the costs associated with the disposition of our Prior Business, and the costs of readying our New Business for gaming licensing and technical operations.
Cash paid for the acquisitions of certain assets of ZenSports was $1,511,647. Cash associated with the disposition of our Prior Business was $77,000, principally related to the settlement of a related demand note payable to TopSight for $35,000, the accrued expenses payable to Ms. Chen of $20,000, and the payment of $22,000 for 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock owned by TopSight, a company owned by our former Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we capitalized $222,824 for software principally for our gaming app, and capitalized $39,041 for legal and professional costs for our Tennesee gaming license.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $4,017,189 during the six months that ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months that ended December 31, 2021. The increase is principally from fundraising and financing used in our acquisitions and to support operations.
The increase in net cash provided by financing is comprised of proceeds of $650,000 for the issuance of 2,166,665 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, the receipt of $102,760 from subscriptions receivable relating to a prior offering of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, an aggregate of $1,430,000 from the issuance of 1,430,000 of our common stock from private placements, and an increase of $1,834,430 from draw downs on our related party demand line of credit.
We were incorporated on April 16, 2020. Since inception, our efforts and operations from our Prior Business to the date of disposition have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities, resulting in negative cash flows and an accumulated deficit from inception through disposition on September 15, 2022. During the six months that ended December 31, 2022, we closed on acquisitions of certain assets of ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer and divested our Prior Business.
We purchased the assets of ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer so we could offer gambling, eSports entertainment, and DeFi opportunities through the acquired technology we are currently enhancing. In January 2023, John Linss our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) resigned and was replaced by our new CEO Mark Thomas. Mr. Thomas was the founder and remains the CEO of ZenSports, Inc., the company we acquired our sports betting technology from. As a result of this change in leadership and consultation with the Board, we have adjusted our business plan to solely focus on sports betting in one jurisdiction, Tennessee, for the foreseeable future. Our current management team believes this new focus will facilitate the revenue generation process more quickly and cost-effectively by focusing on our limited resources.
As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report, we have ceased all operations relating to our Prior Business and commenced executing our adjusted business plan for our New Business. Since our New Business has no history of generating revenues or operating successfully, we will be dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions, including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through the placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement our business plan. Because of our limited operating history, it is difficult to predict our capital needs on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. We will have limited capital available to us if we are unable to raise money through private equity offerings or find alternate forms of financing, which we do not have in place at this time.
We do not expect significant revenues in the short term as we transition from our Prior Business to our New Business and until we secure jurisdictional gaming licenses allowing us to generate revenues from our Sports Betting capabilities. We expect to incur significant increases in operating costs as we incur the costs of transitioning from our Prior Business to our New Business and begin to execute our adjusted New Business operating plan. The expected significant increases in costs will include, but not be limited to, costs relating to obtaining gaming licenses, technology development, sales and marketing, and legal and professional fees.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balancesheet arrangements.
Going Concern
As of December 31, 2022, we have a working capital deficit of $3,177,429. We had a net loss from continuing operations of $3,109,647 for the six months ended
December 31, 2022. We currently have no customers and we do not expect to generate significant revenues in the short term as we transition from our Prior Business to our New Business. We cannot generate sports betting revenues until we secure a jurisdictional gaming license.
We expect to incur significant increases in operating costs as we incur the costs of transitioning from our Prior Business to our New Business and begin to execute our adjusted New Business operating plan. The expected significant increases in costs will include, but not be limited to, costs relating to obtaining gaming licenses, technology development, sales and marketing, and legal and professional fees.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Because of these conditions, we will require additional working capital to develop business operations. Management’s plans are to raise additional working capital through the sale of debt and/or equity instruments as well as to generate revenues once we attain a gaming license . There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve the level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If adequate working capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks
A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
