Basis of Presentation
Thermon Group Holdings, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “we,” “our,” or the “Company” herein. We are one of the largest providers of highly engineered industrial process heating solutions for process industries. We offer a full suite of products (heating units, heating cables, temporary power solutions, tubing bundles, industrial heating blankets and chillers), services (engineering, installation and maintenance services) and software (design optimization and wireless and network control systems) required to deliver comprehensive solutions to some of the world's largest and most complex projects.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial information. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"). In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, and the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and General Economic Environment The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand for our products and services. We are still experiencing effects of lockdowns in certain parts of Asia, which are impacting our results in our Asia-Pacific ("APAC") segment. The effect of loosening pandemic restrictions outside of APAC, along with pent-up demand from periods of stagnant lockdown and uncertainty have combined to strengthen customer demand from most regions we serve, especially in North America. During periods of the pandemic we have experienced, and may experience in the future, a decline in the demand of our products and services or disruptions in raw materials or labor required for manufacturing that has in the past, and may in the future, materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and overall financial performance. We have experienced increased costs across our global supply chain as we focus on meeting growing demand from our customers. In certain circumstances, we have had issues with a lack of availability of certain raw materials as well as increases in costs of our raw materials due to: use of alternate suppliers, higher freight costs, increased lead times, and expedited shipping. We have also had to increase our inventory of certain items to ensure availability in the face of supply chain disruptions. We continue to monitor the pandemic restrictions and other effects the pandemic may have on our business.
On April 11, 2020, the Canadian government officially enacted the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (the “CEWS”) for the purposes of assisting employers in financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic and of reducing potential layoffs of employees.
We recorded no transactions related to CEWS for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. We recorded $ 199
and $ 1,448
related to CEWS to "Cost of sales" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. We recorded $ 4
and $ 504
related to CEWS to "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. We anticipate no benefit from the CEWS program in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), as the program ended in October 2021. Use of Estimates Generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. While management has based its assumptions and estimates on the facts and circumstances existing at December 31, 2022, actual results could differ from those estimates and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the corresponding revenues and expenses as of the date of the financial statements. The operating results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for fiscal
2023. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents 7     The Company maintains restricted cash related to certain letter of credit guarantees and performance bonds securing performance obligations.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and restricted cash included in other non-current assets reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows. December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 35,363   $ 32,566   Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 5,813   2,496   Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 26   341   Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statements of cash flows $ 41,202   $ 35,403       Amounts shown in restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets represent those required to be set aside by a contractual agreement, which generally contain cash deposits pledged as collateral on performance bonds and letters of credit. Additionally, due to the uncertain nature of whether we can repatriate certain funds from our Russian subsidiary, we have classified $ 3,084
of the cash and cash equivalents held in our Russian subsidiary as restricted cash and included the related balance in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Amounts shown in restricted cash in other non-current assets represent such agreements that require a commitment term longer than one year.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Business Combinations -
In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, ("ASU") 2021-08 -
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
(ASC 805). ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. Under this "Topic 606 approach," the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the contracts. This is a departure from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities at fair value. The ASU is effective for all public business entities in annual and interim periods with fiscal years starting after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating this ASU and will consider early adoption with future acquisitions, if any. 2.
Acquisition Powerblanket On May 31, 2022 (the "Acquisition Date"), Thermon Holding Corp., as buyer, acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Powerblanket (“Powerblanket”) from Glacier Capital LLC, as seller (the "Acquisition"). Powerblanket is a leading North American supplier of heated blankets built upon patented heat spreading technology and portable industrial chillers. The Acquisition increases our exposure to growing industrial and commercial end-markets through its freeze protection, temperature control and flow assurance solutions. We have integrated Powerblanket into our United States and Latin America ("US- LAM") reportable segment. From the period May 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022, Powerblanket contributed $ 11,848
in Sales and $ 1,302
in
Net income/(loss) to our consolidated operating results. For the three months ended
December 31, 2022, Powerblanket contributed $ 7,881
in Sales and $ 2,000
in
Net income/(loss) to our consolidated operating results. The initial purchase price for the Acquisition was $ 35,000 , subject to an adjustment for net working capital acquired at closing. Subsequent to the Acquisition Date, and commensurate with the purchase agreement, we increased the purchase price by $ 299
for net working capital acquired. We financed the Acquisition through the use of our Revolving Credit Facility as well as cash on hand. Powerblanket's revenue structure does not result in material contract assets or liabilities.
Acquisition Costs In accordance with GAAP, costs incurred to complete the Acquisition are expensed as incurred. Total acquisition costs, which represent transaction costs, legal fees, and third-party professional fees were $ 278 , of which $ 126
were incurred in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. No acquisition costs were incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Acquisition costs are reflected in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). Purchase Price Allocation We have accounted for the Acquisition according to the business combinations guidance found in ASC 805 -
Business Combinations , henceforth referred to as acquisition accounting. Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. We used primarily Level 2 inputs to allocate the purchase price to the major categories of assets and liabilities shown below, with the exception of the contract- 8 based intangible asset, which was valued using Level 3 inputs. The carrying values of inventories, property, plant and equipment as well as leased assets approximated their respective fair values. During the measurement period, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the Acquisition Date that, if known, would have resulted in revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date, we will revise the preliminary purchase price allocation. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values will be reflected as if the adjustments had been completed on the Acquisition Date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be included in current period earnings.

Fair Value Measurements Fair Value
We measure fair value based on authoritative accounting guidance, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands on required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Inputs are referred to as assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of inputs in the valuation process are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy. • Level 1 — uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities we have the ability to access. • Level 2 — uses observable inputs other than quoted prices in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. • Level 3 — uses one or more significant inputs that are unobservable and supported by little or no market activity, and that reflect the use of significant management judgment.  9 Financial assets and liabilities with carrying amounts approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value because of their short maturities. At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, no assets or liabilities were valued using Level 3 criteria, except for those acquired in our recent acquisition of Powerblanket, discussed in Note 2, "Acquisition."  Information about our financial assets and liabilities is as follows:   December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022     Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Valuation Technique Financial Assets         Deferred compensation plan assets $ 6,020   $ 6,020   $ 5,391 $ 5,391 Level 1 - Active Markets Foreign currency contract forwards assets 80   80   105 105 Level 2 - Market Approach Financial Liabilities   Outstanding borrowings from revolving line of credit $ 24,500   $ 24,500   $ —   $ —   Level 1 - Active Markets Outstanding principal amount of senior secured credit facility 108,279   108,521   129,000   128,355   Level 2 - Market Approach Deferred compensation plan liabilities 5,416   5,416   4,837   4,837   Level 1 - Active Markets Foreign currency contract forwards liabilities 76   76   —   —   Level 2 - Market Approach At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms. As the quoted price is only available for similar financial assets, the Company concluded the pricing is indirectly observable through dealers and has been classified as Level 2.
Additionally, we acquired certain assets and liabilities as disclosed in Note 2, "Acquisition" at fair value according to purchase price accounting. Deferred Compensation Plan     The Company provides a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees where payroll contributions are made by the employees on a pre-tax basis. Included in “Other non-current assets” in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were $ 6,020  and $ 5,391 , respectively, of deferred compensation plan assets held by the Company. Deferred compensation plan assets (mutual funds) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). The Company has a corresponding liability to participants of $ 5,416  and $ 4,837  included in “Other non-current liabilities” in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Deferred compensation plan expense/(income) is included as such in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, and therefore is excluded from "Selling, general and administrative expenses." Deferred compensation plan expense/(income) was $ 464
and $ 292
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $( 499 ) and $ 610  for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expenses and income from our deferred compensation plan were offset by unrealized gains and losses for the deferred compensation plan included in "Other income/expense" on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). Our unrealized losses and (gains) on investments were $( 484 ) and $( 314 ), respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 450
and $( 620 ) for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Trade Related Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to address the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures arise from intercompany transactions as well as third party accounts receivable or payable that are denominated in foreign currencies.
Our forward contracts generally have terms of
30
days. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes or designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. We adjust the carrying amount of all contracts to their fair value at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are included in "Other income/expense" on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). These gains and losses are designed to offset gains and losses resulting from
10 settlement of receivables or payables by our foreign operations which are settled in currency other than the local transactional currency. The fair value is determined by quoted prices from active foreign currency markets (Level 2). Fair value amounts for such forward contracts on our condensed consolidated balance sheets are either classified as accounts receivable, net or accrued liabilities depending on whether the forward contract is in a gain (accounts receivable, net) or loss (accrued liabilities) position. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the notional amounts of forward contracts were as follows: Notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts by currency December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Euro $ 1,000   $ —   Canadian Dollar —   4,000   South Korean Won —   2,250   Mexican Peso 1,500   —   Australian Dollar —   1,000   Total notional amounts $ 2,500   $ 7,250   Foreign currency gains or losses related to our forward contracts in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss) were a gain of $ 102
and a loss of $( 637 ) in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and losses of $( 510 ) and $( 861 ) for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Gains and losses from our forward contracts were offset by transaction gains or losses incurred with the settlement of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net foreign currency transactions resulted in
a gain of $ 193
and losses of $( 949 ), respectively, and losses of
$( 140 )
and
$( 1,634 )
in the nine months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 . 4.
Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income) Impairment and other charges/(income) In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we identified a triggering event in our EMEA reportable segment. Given the continuing depressed economic conditions resulting from the Russo-Ukrainian war, including sanctions related thereto, the Company conducted a strategic assessment of its operations in its Russian subsidiary and we concluded that there was uncertainty in whether the Company could realize significant future economic benefits. Therefore, we recorded a total charge of $ 8,334
in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The charges were comprised of the following: Charge Financial statement impact Amount Increase in Current Expected Credit Loss, or "CECL," allowance for credit loss for certain accounts receivable Accounts receivable, net; Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 835   Increase in inventory reserves Inventories, net; Cost of sales 4,831   Contract asset adjustment Contract assets; Restructuring and other charges/(income) 327   Prepaid expenses and other current assets adjustment Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Income tax receivable; Restructuring and other charges/(income) 1,477   Impairment of Property, plant and equipment, net Property, plant and equipment, net;
Restructuring and other charges/(income) 367   Impairment of Operating lease right-of-use assets
Operating lease right-of-use assets; Restructuring and other charges/(income) 389   Impairment of Other non-current assets Deferred income taxes, Other non-current assets; Restructuring and other charges/(income) 108     $ 8,334   All charges described above were recorded in our Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") reportable segment, with the exception of $ 241
of cost of sales from an increase in inventory reserves in our Canada reportable segment. Additionally,
11 we reclassified $ 3,084
of cash in our Russian subsidiary to restricted cash due to due to the uncertain nature of whether we can repatriate certain funds from our Russian subsidiary. The Company will continue to evaluate sales to international customers with a presence in the Russian Federation and engage in those sales to the extent permissible with various international sanctions.
Please refer to Note 7, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information on impairment, and Note 14, "Subsequent Events," for more information regarding the Company's operations in the Russian Federation. Fiscal 2022 charges/(income) In the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $( 103 ) for severance-related activity in our Canadian segment, which was recorded to "Restructuring and other charges/(income)" in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). Additionally, we recorded $( 311 ) in cash receipts related to receivables existing prior to the sale of our South Africa business, which was completed in fiscal 2021. Restructuring and other charges/(income) by reportable segment were as follows:  Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 United States and Latin America $ —   $ —   $ —   $ ( 46 ) Canada —   —   —   ( 186 ) Europe, Middle East and Africa (1) 2,668   —   2,668   ( 182 ) Asia-Pacific —   —   —   —     $ 2,668   $ —   $ 2,668   $ ( 414 ) (1) - these charges relate to the Company's Russian subsidiary and were included in "Restructuring and other charges/(income)" on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). See the section labeled "Impairment and other charges/(income)" above for a full detail of charges.

equity awards, respectively and for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
39,517
and
139,843
equity awards, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted net income/(loss) per common share, as they would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
The number of common share equivalents, which includes options and both restricted and performance stock units, is computed using the treasury stock method. With regard to the performance stock units, we assume that the associated performance targets will be met at the target level of performance for purposes of calculating diluted net income/(loss) per common share until such time that it is probable that a ctual performance will be above or below target. 12 6.
Inventories Inventories consisted of the following: December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 60,605   $ 41,389   Work in process 5,483   6,294   Finished goods 32,601   25,802   98,689   73,485   Valuation reserves ( 7,271 ) ( 1,835 ) Inventories, net $ 91,418   $ 71,650   7.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment as of December 31, 2022, is as follows:   United States and Latin America Canada Europe, Middle East and Africa Asia-Pacific Total Balance as of March 31, 2022 $ 62,725   $ 122,318   $ 19,087   $ 8,624   $ 212,754   Goodwill acquired (1) 18,620   —   —   —   18,620   Foreign currency translation impact —   ( 9,465 ) ( 714 ) —   ( 10,179 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 81,345   $ 112,853   $ 18,373   $ 8,624   $ 221,195   (1) - Refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more information on the goodwill acquired through our recent acquisition of Powerblanket. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. We perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If required, we also perform a quantitative analysis using the income approach, based on discounted future cash flows, which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations, and the market approach, which is based on market multiples of guideline public companies. The most significant inputs in the Company's quantitative goodwill impairment tests are projected financial information, the weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for similar transactions. Our annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we identified the disruptions to our business from the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war as an indicator of potential impairments in our EMEA reporting unit. We performed our annual goodwill, intangible and tangible impairment assessments including our indefinite life trademarks. Based on the goodwill impairment assessment, there was no impairment of goodwill, intangible or tangible assets or our indefinite life trademarks as of the respective reporting periods.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we identified a triggering event in our EMEA reportable segment. The depressed economic conditions resulting from the Russo-Ukrainian war as well as the related sanctions were contributing factors in our decision to test our EMEA reportable segment under ASC 350 and ASC 360. Based on the results of our quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We did, however, segregate our Russian subsidiary as a new asset group for long-lived asset impairment-testing purposes and determined that the assets relating to our Russian subsidiary were not recoverable under ASC 360. We recorded an impairment charge of $ 756 , which includes Property, plant and equipment, net as well as Operating lease right-of-use assets. Refer to Note 4," Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)," for more information. Separately, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we added $ 18,620
of goodwill as part of our recent acquisition of Powerblanket, which is discussed further in Note 2, "Acquisition." The newly acquired goodwill is allocated to our US-LAM segment. We believe the goodwill acquired in this recent acquisition represents synergies from combining operations in addition to the already identifiable assets. We anticipate being able to deduct goodwill for tax purposes. We will continue to monitor our reporting units' goodwill and asset valuations and test for potential impairments, as appropriate. If overall economic conditions, our key end markets, or factors specific to the Company deteriorate significantly, it could negatively impact the Company's future impairment tests. Our total intangible assets consisted of the following: 13 Gross Carrying Amount at December 31, 2022 Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount at December 31, 2022 Gross Carrying Amount at March 31, 2022 Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount at March 31, 2022 Products $ 61,510   $ ( 31,780 ) $ 29,730   $ 66,669   $ ( 29,445 ) $ 37,224   Trademarks 47,288   ( 1,888 ) 45,400   45,222   ( 1,517 ) 43,705   Developed technology 14,831   ( 6,297 ) 8,534   9,946   ( 5,933 ) 4,013   Customer relationships 113,041   ( 102,105 ) 10,936   113,413   ( 103,900 ) 9,513   Certifications 439   —  439   453   —  453   Contract-based 1,280   ( 157 ) 1,123   —   —   —   Total $ 238,389   $ ( 142,227 ) $ 96,162   $ 235,703   $ ( 140,795 ) $ 94,908   8.

On September 29, 2021, Thermon Group Holdings, Inc., as a credit party and a guarantor, Thermon Holding Corp. (“THC” or the “U.S. Borrower”) and Thermon Canada Inc. (the “Canadian Borrower” and together with THC, the “Borrowers”), as borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time (the “Lenders”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the “Agent”), which was further amended on November 19, 2021. The Credit Agreement is an amendment and restatement of that certain Credit Agreement dated October 30, 2017 by and among Borrowers, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), and provides for the following credit facilities described below (collectively, the “Facilities”). • Revolving Credit Facility: A USD $ 100,000
five -year secured revolving credit facility made available to the U.S. Borrower. The Revolving Credit Facility includes sub-limits for letters of credit and swing-line loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). • U.S. Term Loan Facility: A USD $ 80,000
five -year secured term loan A (the “U.S. Term Loan”) made available to the U.S. Borrower (the “U.S. Term Loan Facility”); and 14 • Canadian Term Loan Facility: A CAD $ 76,182
five -year term loan A (the “Canadian Term Loan” and, together with the U.S. Term Loan, the “Term Loans”) made available to the Canadian Borrower (the “Canadian Term Loan Facility,” and together with the U.S. Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loan Facilities”). Proceeds of the Facilities were used at closing to repay and refinance the Borrowers’ existing indebtedness under the Prior Credit Agreement and pay all interest, fees and expenses related thereto, and thereafter are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for incremental term loans and incremental revolving commitments in an amount not to exceed USD $ 100,000 . Maturity and Repayment Each of the Facilities terminates on September 29, 2026. Commencing January 1, 2022, each of the Term Loans will amortize as set forth in the table below, with payments on the first day of each January, April, July and October, with the balance of each Term Loan Facility due at maturity. Installment Dates Original Principal Amount January 1, 2022, through October 1, 2022 1.25   % January 1, 2023, through October 1, 2024 1.88   % January 1, 2025, through July 1, 2026 2.50   % Guarantees The U.S. Term Loan and the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and all of the U.S. Borrower’s current and future wholly owned domestic material subsidiaries (the “U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors”), subject to certain exceptions. The Canadian Term Loan is guaranteed by the Company, the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors and each of the wholly owned Canadian material subsidiaries of the Canadian Borrower, subject to certain exceptions. Security The U.S. Term Loan and the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first lien on all of the assets of the Company, the U.S. Borrower and the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors, including 100% of the capital stock of the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first tier material foreign subsidiaries of the Company, the U.S. Borrower and the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Canadian Term Loan is secured by a first lien on all of the assets of the Company, the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors, the Canadian Borrower and the material Canadian subsidiaries of the Canadian Borrower, including 100% of the capital stock of the Canadian Borrower’s material Canadian subsidiaries. Interest Rates and Fees The U.S. Borrower will have the option to pay interest on the U.S. Term Loan and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at a base rate, plus an applicable margin, or at a rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Canadian Borrower will have the option to pay interest on the Canadian Term Loan at a prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or at a rate based on the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or "CDOR," plus an applicable margin.
Under the applicable Facilities, the margin for base rate loans and Canadian prime rate loans is
62.5
basis points and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans and CDOR loans is
162.5
basis points; provided that, following the completion of one full fiscal quarter after the closing date, the applicable margins will be determined based on a leverage-based performance grid.
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, the U.S. Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of unutilized revolving commitments of
0.25 % per annum, provided that, following the completion of one full fiscal quarter after the closing date, the commitment fee will be determined based on a leverage-based performance grid. Voluntary Prepayment
The Borrowers will be able to voluntarily prepay the principal of the loans outstanding under each of the Facilities without penalty or premium (subject to breakage fees) at any time in whole or in part. Mandatory Prepayment 15 Each Borrower is required to repay its respective Term Loan with certain asset sale and insurance proceeds and certain debt proceeds. Debt Issuance Costs In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we incurred fees to third parties in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement described above. The debt issuance costs of $ 1,265
were capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 2,569 , which was recorded to Other income/(expense) on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). Financial Covenants In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company is required, on a consolidated basis, to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. On the last day of any period of four fiscal quarters ending during a period set forth below, the Company must maintain a consolidated leverage ratio that does not exceed the ratios for such period set forth below (each of which ratios may be increased by 0.50:1.00 for each of the four fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions at the election of the U.S. Borrower): Fiscal Quarter Ending Consolidated Leverage Ratio September 30, 2021, through September 30, 2022 3.75:1.00 December 31, 2022, and each fiscal quarter thereafter 3.50:1.00 In addition, on the last day of any period of four fiscal quarters ending on or after September 30, 2021, the Company must maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.25 :1.00. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and there is no material uncertainty about our ongoing ability to comply with our covenants.
Other Covenants
The Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to certain exclusions) that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Borrowers) to: • incur additional indebtedness; • grant liens; • make fundamental changes; • sell assets; • make restricted payments; • enter into sales and leasebacks; • make investments; • prepay certain indebtedness; • enter into transactions with affiliates; and • enter into restrictive agreements. The covenants are subject to various baskets and materiality thresholds, with certain of the baskets to the restrictions on the repayment of subordinated or unsecured indebtedness, restricted payments and investments being available only when the Company’s pro forma leverage ratios are less than a certain level. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, judgment defaults, actual or asserted failure of any guaranty or security documents to be in full force and effect and change of control. If such an event of default occurs, the Agent will be entitled to take various actions, including the termination of the commitment for the Revolving Credit Facility, the acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement and certain other actions that a secured creditor is customarily permitted to take following a default.     At December 31, 2022, we had $ 24,500
in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had
$ 73,655
of available borrowing capacity thereunder after taking into account the borrowing base and
$ 1,845
o f outstanding letters of credit and the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. The Term Loans bear interest at the LIBOR rate or CDOR rate, as applicable, in each case plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage
16 ratio (as described above). The interest rates on the Term Loan Facilities on December 31, 2022 were
5.93 %
for the Canadian Term Loan Facility,
5.42 %
for the U.S. Term Loan Facility, and
5.63 %
for the
U.S. Revolving Credit Facility. Interest expense has been presented net of interest income on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). 10.
Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies We are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business. Some of these proceedings may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us, which may adversely affect our financial results. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in various disputes, which may or may not be settled prior to legal proceedings being instituted and which may result in losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, relating to such unresolved disputes. As of December 31, 2022, management believes that adequate reserves have been established for any probable and reasonably estimable losses. Expenses related to litigation reduce operating income. We do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings or disputes would have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, long-term results of operations, or cash flows. It is possible, however, that charges related to these matters could be significant to our results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period.
In January 2020, the Company received service of process in a class action application in the Superior Court of Quebec, Montreal, Canada related to certain heating elements previously manufactured by THS and incorporated into certain portable construction heaters sold by certain manufacturers. The Company believes this claim is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the claim. While the Company continues to dispute the allegations, in March 2021, it reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiff and other defendants to resolve this matter without admitting to any liability; such agreement remains subject to the agreement of the parties on the terms of a definitive settlement agreement. Settlement of this matter on the agreed terms will require the Company to contribute an amount that would not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The settlement is subject to, among other things, approval by the Superior Court. Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees At December 31, 2022, the Company had in place letter of credit guarantees and performance bonds securing certain performance obligations of the Company. These arrangements totaled
$ 29,742 . Of this amount, $ 1,259
is secured by cash deposits at the Company’s financial institutions and an additional $ 1,845
represents a reduction of the available amount of the Company's short-term and long-term revolving lines of credit. In addition to the arrangements totaling $ 29,742 , our Indian subsidiary also has $ 4,383
in non-collateralized customs bonds outstanding to secure the Company's customs and duties obligations in India.

Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location, as well as revenues recognized at point in time and revenues recognized over time, as we believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue recognized at a point-in-time based on when control transitions to the customer is generally related to our product sales. Point-in-time revenue does not typically require engineering or installation services. Revenue recognized over time occurs on our projects where engineering or installation services, or a combination of the two, are required. We recognize revenue related to such projects in a systematic way that reflects the transfer of goods or services, or a combination of goods and services, to the customer.
Disaggregation of revenues from contracts with customers for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 17 Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Revenues recognized at point in time Revenues recognized over time Total Revenues recognized at point in time Revenues recognized over time Total United States and Latin America $ 34,762   $ 24,988   $ 59,750   $ 19,695   $ 30,132   $ 49,827   Canada 32,725   10,446   43,171   25,358   5,696   31,054   Europe, Middle East and Africa 6,643   4,582   11,225   7,896   5,041   12,937   Asia-Pacific 4,268   3,696   7,964   4,654   2,141   6,795   Total revenues $ 78,398   $ 43,712   $ 122,110   $ 57,603   $ 43,010   $ 100,613   Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 Revenues recognized at point in time Revenues recognized over time Total Revenues recognized at point in time Revenues recognized over time Total United States and Latin America $ 82,627   $ 70,150   $ 152,777   $ 50,565   $ 52,360   $ 102,925   Canada 83,512   26,638   110,150   64,490   16,938   81,428   Europe, Middle East and Africa 17,811   12,993   30,804   21,218   23,148   44,366   Asia-Pacific 15,565   8,813   24,378   15,810   8,561   24,371   Total revenues $ 199,515   $ 118,594   $ 318,109   $ 152,083   $ 101,007   $ 253,090   Performance Obligations     At December 31, 2022, revenues associated with our open performance obligations totaled $ 164,653 . Within this amount, approximately $ 14,276
will be earned as revenue in excess of
one year . We expect to recognize the remaining revenues associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations within 12 months.
Contract Assets and Liabilities     As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, contract assets were $ 16,597
and $ 19,626 , respectively. There were no losses recognized on our contract assets for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, except as described in Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)." As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, contract liabilities were $ 9,780
and $ 8,010 , respectively. The majority of contract liabilities at March 31, 2022 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2023. We typically recognize revenue associated with our contract liabilities within 12 months. 12.
Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was
29.1 % and
32.2 % for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In connection with the strategic assessment related to our Russian subsidiary, the Company released accrued withholding taxes on earning repatriations for a discrete tax benefit of $ 1,033
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. We do not expect to generate further tax benefits in Russia. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded discrete tax expenses of $ 301
related to withholding taxes in Canada and $ 430
related to an increase in withholding tax rate in our Russian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2022, we have established a long-term liability for uncertain tax positions in the amount of $ 943 . As of December 31, 2022, the tax years for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2022, remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions. 13.
Segment Information We maintain  four  reportable segments based on  four  geographic countries or regions in which we operate: (i) United States and Latin America ("US-LAM"), (ii) Canada, (iii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and (iv) Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Within our  four  reportable segments, our core products and services are focused on the following markets:
chemical and petrochemical, oil, gas, power generation, commercial, food and beverage, rail and transit, and other, which we refer to as our "key end markets." We offer a full suite of products (heating units, heating cables, industrial heating blankets and related products, temporary power solutions and tubing bundles), services (engineering, installation and maintenance services)
18 and software (design optimization and wireless and network control systems) required to deliver comprehensive solutions to some of the world's largest and most complex projects.
Profitability within our segments is measured by operating income. Profitability can vary in each of our reportable segments based on the competitive environment within the region, the level of corporate overhead, such as the salaries of our senior executives and the level of research and development and marketing activities in the region, as well as the mix of products and services. For purposes of this note, revenue is attributed to individual countries or regions on the basis of the physical location and jurisdiction of organization of the subsidiary that invoices the material and services.      Total sales to external customers, inter-segment sales, depreciation expense, amortization expense, income from operations, property, plant and equipment, net and total assets for each of our
four
reportable segments are as follows:

Subsequent Events      As a result of the continued impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war, including sanctions related thereto, the Company conducted a strategic assessment of its operations in the Russian Federation, and, on January 31, 2023, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) authorized the Company to withdraw from its operations in the Russian Federation (the “Russia Exit”) through a planned disposition of its Russian subsidiary. Consequently, in addition to the loss described in Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)," the Company could recognize an additional $ 4
million to $ 7  million of loss. We expect to complete the Russia Exit by the first quarter of our fiscal 2024, subject to the receipt of regulatory approval by the government of the Russian Federation and certain lenders under the Company's Facilities. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in our financial condition and results of our operations.

Any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and could influence whether any forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this quarterly report ultimately prove to be accurate.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required to do so under applicable securities laws. Business Overview and Company History We are one of the largest providers of highly engineered industrial process heating solutions for process industries. For over 65 years, we have served a diverse base of thousands of customers around the world in attractive and growing markets, including chemical and petrochemical, oil and gas, power generation, commercial, rail and transit, and other, which we refer to as our "key end markets." We offer a full suite of products (heating units, heating cables, temporary power solutions, tubing bundles, industrial heating blankets and chillers), services (engineering, installation and maintenance services) and software (design optimization and wireless and network control systems) required to deliver comprehensive solutions to some of the world's largest and most complex projects. With a legacy of innovation and continued investment in research and development, Thermon has established itself as a technology leader in hazardous or classified areas, and we are committed to developing sustainable solutions for our customers. We serve our customers through a global network of sales and service professionals and distributors in more than 30 countries and through our eight manufacturing facilities on three continents. These global capabilities and longstanding relationships with some of the largest multinational oil and gas, chemical processing, power and engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") companies in the world have enabled us to diversify our revenue streams
21 and opportunistically access high growth markets worldwide. During YTD 2023 and YTD 2022, approximately 55% and 59%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from outside of the United States. Revenue.   Our revenues are derived from providing customers with a full suite of innovative and reliable process heating solutions, including advanced heating and filtration solutions for industrial and hazardous area applications. Revenue recognized at a point in time based on when control transitions to the customer is generally related to our product sales. Point in time revenue does not typically require engineering or installation services. Revenue recognized over time occurs on our projects where engineering or installation services, or a combination of the two, are required. We recognize revenue related to such projects in a systematic way that reflects the transfer of goods or services, or a combination of goods and services, to the customer.
We maintain four reportable segments based on four geographic countries or regions in which we operate: (i) United States and Latin America ("US-LAM"), (ii) Canada, (iii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and (iv) Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Within our four reportable segments, our core products and services are focused on the following markets:
chemical and petrochemical, oil, gas, power generation, commercial, rail and transit, food and beverage, and other, which we refer to as our "key end markets."
We believe that our pipeline of planned projects, in addition to our backlog of signed purchase orders, provides us with some visibility into our future revenue. Historically, we have experienced few order cancellations, and the cancellations that have occurred in the past have not been material compared to our total contract volume or total backlog. The small number of order cancellations is attributable in part to the fact that a large portion of our solutions are ordered and installed toward the end of large project construction. Our backlog at December 31, 2022, was $164.7 million, as compared to $156.2 million at March 31, 2022. The timing of recognition of revenue out of backlog is not always certain, as it is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays, many of which are beyond our control (such as customers' delivery schedules and levels of capital and maintenance expenditures). When delays occur, the recognition of revenue associated with the delayed project is likewise deferred. Cost of sales.
Our cost of sales primarily includes the costs of raw material items used in the manufacturing of our products, costs of ancillary products that are sourced from external suppliers and construction labor cost. Additional costs of revenue include contract engineering costs directly associated to projects, direct labor costs, shipping and handling costs, and other costs associated with our manufacturing/fabrication operations. The other costs associated with our manufacturing/fabrication operations are primarily indirect production costs, including depreciation, indirect labor costs, warranty-related costs, and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance. Key raw material costs include polymers, copper, stainless steel, insulating material, and other miscellaneous parts related to products manufactured or assembled as part of our heat tracing solutions. Raw material costs have been stable in the past; however, we face challenges from time to time with temporary shortages related to the global supply chain issues that have persisted since COVID-19 pandemic in certain raw materials as well as an increase in costs of these materials due to use of alternate suppliers, higher freight costs, increased lead times, expedited shipping and other inflationary factors. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to mitigate temporary raw material shortages or be able to pass along such cost increases, including the potential impacts of tariffs or supply chain challenges, to our customers in the future, and if we are unable to do so, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Operating expenses.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") are primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for sales, marketing, pre-sales engineering and administrative personnel, plus other sales related expenses as well as other costs related to research and development, insurance, professional fees, the global integrated business information system, and provisions for bad debts. In addition, our deferred compensation expense includes a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees where payroll contributions are made by the employees on a pre-tax basis. The expense/income associated with our deferred compensation plan is titled "Deferred compensation plan expense/(income)" on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss).
Key drivers affecting our results of operations.   Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, including those described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 26, 2022, and in any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we have filed or may file with the SEC, including those described below. These factors include the following: • Impact of product mix.  Typically, our customers require our products as well as our engineering and construction services. The level of service and construction needs affect the profit margin for each type of revenue.
We tend to experience lower margins from our design optimization, engineering, installation and maintenance services, which are typically large projects tied to our customers capex budgets and are comprised of more than $0.5 million in total revenue. For clarity, we will refer to these as "Over time large projects." Our results of operations in recent years have been impacted by the various construction phases of Over time large projects. We are typically designated as the heat tracing provider of choice by the project owner. We then engage with multiple
22 contractors to address incorporating various heat tracing solutions throughout the overall project. Our largest projects may generate revenue for several quarters. In the early stages of an Over time large project, our revenues are typically realized from the provision of engineering services. In the middle stages, or the material requirements phase, we typically experience the greatest demand for our heat tracing cable, at which point our revenues tend to accelerate. Revenues tend to decrease gradually in the final stages of a project and are generally derived from installation services and demand for electrical panels and other miscellaneous electronic components used in the final installation of heat tracing cable, which we frequently outsource from third-party manufacturers.
Projects which do not require installation and maintenance services are smaller in size and representative of maintenance, repairs and small upgrades necessary to improve efficiency and uptime. These small projects are typically tied to our customers operating expense budgets with improved profit margins, and are generally less than $0.5 million in total revenue. We will refer to such projects as "Over time small projects." The most profitable of our sales are derived from selling our heating products, for which we recognize revenue at a point in time. We also tend to experience lower margins from our outsourced products, such as electrical switch gears and transformers, than we do from our manufactured products. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by our mix of products and services.
We estimate that Point in time and Over time revenues have each made the following contribution as a percentage of total revenue in the periods listed: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Point in time 64  % 57  % 63  % 60  % Over time: 36  % 43  % 37  % 40  % Small projects 14  % 15  % 15  % 16  % Large projects 22  % 28  % 22  % 24  % Our Over time revenue includes (i) products and services which are billed on a time and materials basis, and (ii) fixed fee contracts for complex turnkey solutions. For our time and materials service contracts, we recognize revenues as the products and services are provided over the term of the contract and have determined that the stated rate for installation services and products is representative of the stand-alone selling price for those services and products. Our turnkey projects, or fixed fee projects, offer our customers a comprehensive solution for heat tracing from the initial planning stage through engineering/design, manufacture, installation and final proof-of-performance and acceptance testing. Turnkey services also include project planning, product supply, system integration, commissioning and on-going maintenance. Turnkey solutions, containing multiple deliverables, are customer specific and do not have an alternative use and present an unconditional right to payment, and thus are treated as a single performance obligation with revenues recognized over time as work progresses. For revenue recognized under fixed fee turnkey contracts, we measure the costs incurred that contribute towards the satisfaction of our performance obligation as a percentage of the total cost of production (the “cost-to-cost method”), and we recognize a proportionate amount of contract revenue, as the cost-to-cost method appropriately depicts performance towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. Changes to the original cost amount may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis. Sales and gross profits are adjusted using the cumulative catch-up method for revisions in estimated contract costs. Reviews of estimates have not generally resulted in significant adjustments to our results of operations. Point in time revenue represents goods transferred to customers at a point in time and is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control upon shipment.
• Cyclicality of end-users' markets.
Demand for our products and services depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures of our customers and end users, in particular those in the energy, oil, gas, chemical processing and power generation industries, and firms that design and construct facilities for these industries. These customers' expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns. Large projects historically have been a substantial source of revenue growth, and large project revenues tend to be more cyclical than maintenance and repair revenues. A sustained decrease in capital and maintenance spending or in new facility construction by our customers could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and our business, financial condition and results of operations.
23 • Acquisition strategy.
In recent years, we have been executing on a strategy to grow the Company through the acquisition of businesses that are either in the process heating solutions industry or provide complementary products and solutions for the markets and customers we serve. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more discussion of our recent acquisition.
Recent Developments As a result of the continued impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war, including sanctions related thereto, the Company conducted a strategic assessment of its operations in the Russian Federation, and, on January 31, 2023, the Board authorized the Company to withdraw from its operations in the Russian Federation (the "Russia Exit"). We expect to execute the Russia Exit by the first quarter of our fiscal 2024. However, the Russia Exit is subject to the receipt of regulatory approval by the government of the Russian Federation and certain lenders under the Company's Facilities. As a result, the timing of the Russia Exit is uncertain. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)" and Note 14, "Subsequent Events" for more information. On May 31, 2022, our subsidiary Thermon Holding Corp., as buyer, acquired Powerblanket, (“Powerblanket”), from Glacier Capital LLC, as seller (the "Acquisition"). Powerblanket is a leading North American supplier of heated blankets built upon patented heat spreading technology, and portable industrial chillers. The purchase price for the acquisition was $35.3 million. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more information. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand for our products and services. We are still experiencing effects of lockdowns in Asia, which are impacting our results in our APAC segment. The effect of loosening pandemic restrictions outside of APAC, along with pent-up demand from periods of stagnant lockdown and uncertainty have combined to strengthen customer demand from most regions we serve, especially in North America. During periods of the pandemic we experienced, and we may in the future experience, a decline in the demand of our products and services or disruptions in raw materials or labor required for manufacturing that has in the past, and may in the future, materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and overall financial performance. We continue to monitor the pandemic restrictions and other effects the pandemic may have on our business.
24 Results of Operations - Three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021      The following table sets forth our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and indicates the amount of change and percentage change between periods.

Revenues increased in Interim 2023 primarily due to strong performance in our Canada and US-LAM reportable segments, which grew revenues $12.1 million, or 39%, and $9.9 million, or 20%, respectively, compared to Interim 2022. Revenues in these segments were bolstered in part by strong demand in our upstream and downstream Oil and Gas end markets. Additionally, our recent acquisition of Powerblanket in the US-LAM segment contributed $7.9 million in revenue growth in Interim 2023. In our APAC segment, revenues increased by $1.2 million, or 17%, compared to Interim 2022. Revenues in APAC benefited from some recovering business activity coming off of the effects of extended COVID-19-related lockdowns in the region. Revenue in our EMEA segment contracted in Interim 2023, with a decline of $(1.7) million, or (13)%, compared to Interim 2022. Impacting revenue in EMEA were the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian war to our Russian subsidiary, as well as the overall recessionary environment which resulted in fewer projects and less volume and consequently, greater competition. Separately, revenue was negatively impacted in Interim 2023
by foreign exchange rates by $5.2 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the Company's foreign currency-denominated operations. Point in time revenues in Interim 2023 were $78.4 million, or 64%, of total sales, while Over time revenues were $43.7 million, or 36%. This compares to 57% Point in time revenues and 43% Over time revenues in Interim 2022. Refer to the "Overview" section above for definitions of Point in time and Over time revenue. 25 Gross profit and margin.
The higher gross profit in Interim 2023 is primarily attributable to strong Point in time and Over time sales in our US-LAM and Canada segments coupled with improved gross margin due to customer price increases and operational efficiencies. These positive drivers were partially offset by $4.8 million, or 396 bps, associated with the charges in our Russian subsidiary in addition to incremental costs from global supply chain challenges. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)" for more information regarding the charges in our Russian subsidiary. Selling, general and administrative expenses .
The increase in SG&A expenses in Interim 2023 was driven by greater sales activity resulting in higher salaries & benefits, performance-based incentive compensation, sales commissions, as well as increased travel and marketing costs. Additionally, the acquisition of Powerblanket added approximately $2.0 million of incremental SG&A expenses not present in Interim 2022. SG&A as a percent of sales was 25.3% in Interim 2023 versus 22.0% in Interim 2022. This increase in SG&A as a percent of sales was attributable in part to greater stock compensation expense associated with performance-based shares and higher bad debt expense, which includes $0.8 million related to the charges in our Russian subsidiary.
Deferred compensation plan expense/(income).
The increase in deferred compensation plan expense in Interim 2023 is attributable in part to increases in compensation deferred by certain employees as well as market fluctuations in the underlying balances as compared to Interim 2022. To note, this compensation plan expense/(income) is materially offset in other income/(expense) where the Company records market gains/(losses) on the related investment assets. Refer to Note 3, "Fair Value Measurements," for more information. Amortization of intangible assets.
Amortization of intangible assets in Interim 2023 increased over Interim 2022, as we began to amortize more intangible assets following our acquisition of Powerblanket in the first fiscal quarter of the 2023. Please refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more information regarding our acquisition. Restructuring and other charges/(income).
Restructuring and other charges/(income) was $2.7 million in Interim 2023 and zero in Interim 2022. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)" for more information. Interest expense, net.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher average interest rate during Interim 2023, which was approximately 5% versus approximately 2% during Interim 2022. See Note 9, "Debt," for additional information on our long-term debt. Other income/(expense).
The increase in other income is primarily due to foreign currency gains, net in Interim 2023 versus losses, net in Interim 2022. The remaining variance is attributable to relatively more gains on the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan than in the prior year due to market fluctuations. These gains are materially offset by increased deferred compensation plan expense/(income) as noted above.
Income tax expense/(benefit).
Our effective tax rate was 34.4% and 23.3% in Interim 2023 and Interim 2022, respectively. The increase in rate is almost entirely due to the Company's decision to exit its operations in the Russian Federation. During Interim 2023, w e recorded a total pretax charge of $8,334 for which the Company does not anticipate receiving any tax benefits, except for releasing
$1.0 million in Interim 2023 related to estimated withholding taxes at our Russian subsidiary. Refer to Note 12, “Income Taxes,” for additional detail.
Net income/(loss).
The change in net income/(loss) is explained by the changes noted in the sections above. 26 Results of Operations - Nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The following table sets forth our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and indicates the amount of change and percentage change between periods. (Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease)   2022 2021 $ % Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:         Sales $ 318,109  $ 253,090  $ 65,019  26  % Cost of sales 184,508  154,084  30,424  20  % Gross profit 133,601  99,006  34,595  35  % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 83,046  66,820  16,226  24  % Deferred compensation plan expense/(income) (499) 610  (1,109) (182) % Amortization of intangible assets 7,072  6,613  459  7  % Restructuring and other charges/(income) 2,668  (414) 3,082  (744) % Income/(loss) from operations 41,314  25,377  15,937  Other income/(expenses): Interest expense, net (4,120) (5,029) 909  (18) % Other income/(expense) (592) (3,517) 2,925  (83) % Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes 36,602  16,831  19,771  117  % Income tax expense/(benefit) 10,637  5,424  5,213  96  % Net income/(loss) $ 25,965  $ 11,407  $ 14,558  128  % As a percent of sales: Change in basis points Gross profit 42.0  % 39.1  % 290 bps Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.1  % 26.4  % -30 bps Income/(loss) from operations 13.0  % 10.0  % 300 bps Net income/(loss) 8.2  % 4.5  % 370 bps Effective tax rate 29.1  % 32.2  % Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 (“YTD 2023”) Compared to the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 (“YTD 2022”) Revenues .
Revenue increased in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022 due to strong performance in our US-LAM and Canada segments. US-LAM revenue increased $49.9 million, or 48%, while Canada revenue increased $28.7 million, or 35%. Revenues in these segments were bolstered in part by strong demand in our upstream and downstream Oil and Gas end markets. Additionally, our recent acquisition of Powerblanket in the US-LAM segment contributed $12.0 million in revenue growth in YTD 2023. These increases were partly offset by contraction in our EMEA segment, with a decrease in revenue of $(13.6) million, or (31)%. Revenue in our APAC segment was flat compared to YTD 2022. The ongoing effects of the Russo-Ukrainian war as well as the overall recessionary environment impacted the results in EMEA, while lingering COVID-19 lockdowns and their effects has delayed recovery in APAC. Separately, revenue was negatively impacted in YTD 2023
by foreign exchange rates by approximately, $11.2 million. Point in time revenue and Over time revenue comprised 63% and 37% of sales in YTD 2023, respectively, and 60% and 40% in YTD 2022, respectively. Gross profit and margin.
Gross profit increased $34.6 million on greater sales volumes and greater profitability with gross margin improving by 290 bps. We delivered increased sales in both Over time sales as well as Point in time sales during YTD 2023, while more profitable point in time sales grew as a percent of the mix. Furthermore, YTD 2023 gross margin was augmented by improved gross margin due to customer price increases as well as operational efficiencies. However, these positive drivers were partially offset by $4.8 million, or 152 bps, associated with the charges in our Russian subsidiary, as well
27 as incremental costs from global supply chain challenges. Separately, gross margin in YTD 2022 was diluted, in part, by warranty costs associated with the operational execution of a large project in our US-LAM segment that was completed in a prior year, which was somewhat offset by benefits from the Canadian Emergency Wage program ("CEWS"). Refer to Note 1, "Basis of Presentation," for more information on CEWS. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)" for more information regarding the charges in our Russian subsidiary. Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.2 million in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022 driven by costs associated with greater sales activity resulting in increased salaries and benefits, incentive pay, commissions, travel, and marketing costs. In addition, costs increased in YTD 2023 due to the acquisition of Powerblanket. However, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased by 30 bps, which is attributable to continued sales growth coupled with prudent cost management. Deferred compensation plan expense/(income).
Deferred compensation plan expense/(income) generated income in YTD 2023 due to market fluctuations in the underlying balances owed to employees. This compensation plan expense/(income) is materially offset in other income/(expense) where the Company recorded market gains/(losses) on related investment assets. Refer to Note 3, "Fair Value Measurements," for more information. Restructuring and other charges/(income).
Restructuring and other charges/(income) was $2.7 million in YTD 2023
and (0.4) million in YTD 2022. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring and Other Charges/(Income)" for more information. Amortization of intangible assets.
Amortization of intangible assets increased in YTD 2023 as compared to YTD 2022, as we began to amortize more intangible assets following our acquisition of Powerblanket in the first fiscal quarter of the 2023. Activity within these accounts is driven by periodic straight-line amortization of our acquired intangibles.
Interest expense, net.
Interest expense, net decreased in YTD 2023 as compared to YTD 2022 due primarily to lower average outstanding principal. Refer to Note 9, "Debt," for more information on our outstanding debt. Other income/(expense).
The decrease in Other income/(expense) in YTD 2023 was primarily due to the debt extinguishment costs recognized in YTD 2022 that were absent in YTD 2023, as well as greater losses, net on foreign currency transactions in YTD 2022. The remaining change is attributable to market fluctuations in the underlying investments associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. These unrealized gains and losses on investments were materially offset by deferred compensation plan expense/(income) as noted above.     Income taxes . Income tax expense was $10.6 million in YTD 2023 on pre-tax income of $36.6 million compared to income tax expense of $5.4 million in YTD 2022 on pre-tax income of $16.8 million, an increase of $5.2 million in income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% and 32.2% in YTD 2023 and YTD 2022, respectively. The YTD 2023 rate was impacted by the charges in our Russian subsidiary. Specifically, during Interim 2023, w e recorded a total pretax charge of $8,334 for which the Company does not anticipate receiving any tax benefits, except for releasing
$1.0 million in Interim 2023 related to estimated withholding taxes at our Russian subsidiary. During YTD 2022, we recorded discrete tax items totaling $0.7 million primarily related to withholding taxes in Canada and Russia. Net income/(loss).
The change in net income/(loss) is explained by the changes noted above. Contingencies     See Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included above in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this quarterly report, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.
28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service needs and potential future acquisitions.  At December 31, 2022, we had $35.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We manage our global cash requirements by maintaining cash and cash equivalents at various financial institutions throughout the world where we operate. Approximately $9.4 million, or 27%, of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various institutions and approximately $26.0 million, or 73%, of these amounts were held in accounts outside of the United States with various financial institutions. While we require cash needs at our various foreign operations, excess cash is available for distribution to the United States through intercompany dividends or debt reduction in Canada. We had $3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held in our Russian subsidiary at December 31, 2022. Due to the uncertain nature of whether we can repatriate certain funds from our Russian subsidiary, $3.1 million was classified as restricted and therefore, not included in the cash and cash equivalents balance noted above. Please refer to Note 1, "Basis of Presentation," for more information regarding our restricted cash. Generally, we seek to maintain a cash and cash equivalents balance between $30.0 and $40.0 million. We will encounter periods where we may be above or below this range, due to, for example, inventory buildup for anticipated seasonal demand in fall and winter months, related cash receipts from credit sales in months that follow, debt maturities, restructuring activities, larger capital investments, severe and/or protracted economic downturns, acquisitions, or some combination of the above activities. The Company continues to manage its working capital requirements effectively through optimizing inventory levels, doing business with credit-worthy customers, and extending payments terms with its supplier base. Future Cash Requirements Our future capital requirements depend on many factors as noted throughout this report. We believe that, based on our current level of operations and related cash flows, plus cash on hand and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We had $24.5 million of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022. The $24.5 million was borrowed to support the acquisition of Powerblanket. Although subject to change and not required by our Credit Facility, we intend to pay back the outstanding balance within the next twelve months. Please refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more information regarding our acquisition.
For fiscal 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 2.0% to 2.5% of revenue. Additionally, we expect to pay $10.2 million in principal payments on our long-term debt, as well as $3.5 million related to our leased assets in the next twelve months. See further details in Note 9, "Debt," in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this quarterly report. We also have payment commitments of $3.4 million, mostly related to long-term information technology contracts, of which $2.0 million are due within the next twelve months.
Strategic Investments Our long term plan includes investments in three key areas as we look to profitably grow the Company beyond its existing installed base.
First, we expect to diversify our revenues into adjacent markets like commercial, food & beverage, transportation and other non-oil and gas industries where we can continue to differentiate our offerings through quality, safety and customer service, while also aligning Thermon’s strategy around the energy transition toward a more sustainable global economy.
Second, we anticipate a multi-decades investment trend to emerge based on the rapidly increasing desire for industrial customers to electrify equipment to reduce their carbon footprint, which represents an opportunity for the Company. Thermon's process heating expertise will be a key factor in a successful, sustainable transition, and we expect to invest in additional resources to quickly respond to changing customer demand. Finally, we will continue expanding our technology-enabled maintenance solutions, like our recently launched Genesis Network, which helps our customers more efficiently and safely monitor and maintain their heating systems by utilizing our software, analytics, hardware and process heating maintenance expert services.
These three initiatives will include incremental investments, as evidenced by our investment in our legacy business as well as our recent acquisition of Powerblanket, over a multi-year period, that we expect will result in a more diversified, sustainable, and profitable company over time. 29 Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows Nine months ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Increase/(Decrease) Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 31,605   $ 13,746   $ 17,859  Investing activities ( 40,309 ) ( 2,685 ) (37,624) Financing activities 6,729   ( 17,287 ) 24,016  Free Cash Flow: (1) Cash provided by operating activities $ 31,605  $ 13,746  $ 17,859  Less: Cash used for purchases of property, plant, and equipment ( 5,173 ) ( 2,920 ) (2,253) Plus: Sales of rental equipment 163   235   (72) Free Cash Flow $ 26,595  $ 11,061  $ 15,534  (1) "Free Cash Flow" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, net of sales of rental equipment and proceeds from sales of land and buildings. Free Cash Flow is one measure management uses internally to assess liquidity. Our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows increased in YTD 2023 as compared to YTD 2022 primarily due to an increase in net income of $14.6 million and less investments in net working capital accounts of $6.4 million, partly offset by relatively less non-cash items of $3.1 million.
Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing increased in YTD 2023 as compared to YTD 2022 primarily due to the acquisition of Powerblanket for $35.3 million on May 31, 2022. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisition," for more information. Additionally, we increased our capital expenditures by $2.3 million in YTD 2023 as compared to YTD 2022, mostly for machinery and equipment, including Temporary Power Solutions rental assets, as well as information technology assets. Financing Cash Flows Financing cash flows increased in YTD 2023 versus YTD 2022 primarily due to the drawdown on our Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $32.0 million, of which we paid back $7.5 million in YTD 2023. The Revolving Credit Facility borrowings were used to acquire Powerblanket, as mentioned above.
Credit Facilities
On September 29, 2021, Thermon Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), as a credit party and a guarantor, and its subsidiaries Thermon Holding Corp. (“THC” or the “U.S. Borrower”) and Thermon Canada Inc. (the “Canadian Borrower” and together with THC, the “Borrowers”), as borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time (the “Lenders”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the “Agent”). The Credit Agreement is an amendment and restatement of that certain Credit Agreement dated October 30, 2017 by and among Borrowers, the lenders time to time party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), and provides for the credit facilities described in Note 9, "Debt," in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this quarterly report.
We had $24.5 million of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2022. Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to evaluating our cash flow generation based upon operating, investing, and financing activities, the Company believes that the non-GAAP measure used in this section may provide investors and key stakeholders with another important perspective regarding our performance. The Company does not intend for this non-GAAP metric to be a substitute for the related GAAP measure, nor should it be viewed in isolation and without considering all relevant GAAP measurements. Moreover, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 30 We define “Free Cash Flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, net of sales of rental equipment as well as proceeds from sales of land and buildings. This metric should not be interpreted to mean the remaining cash that is available for discretionary spending, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, or other purposes, as it excludes significant, mandatory obligations, such as principal payments on the Company’s long-term debt facility. Free cash flow is one measure that the Company uses internally to assess liquidity. Free Cash Flow totaled $26.6 million for YTD 2023 as compared to $11.1 million for YTD 2022, the drivers of which are explained above under "Results of Operations." Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the Company’s contractual obligations during YTD 2023. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any interest in entities commonly referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities. See the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed on May 26, 2022, for further details. Critical Accounting Polices Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 26, 2022, for a discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation,” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included above in Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this quarterly report for information on recent accounting pronouncements, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Foreign currency risk relating to operations.  We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Approximately 55% of our YTD 2023 consolidated revenue was generated by sales from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally sell their products and services in the local currency, but obtain a significant amount of their products from our manufacturing facilities located elsewhere, primarily the United States, Canada and Europe. Significant changes in the relevant exchange rates could adversely affect our margins on foreign sales of products. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries incur most of their expenses (other than intercompany expenses) in their local functional currency. These currencies include the Canadian Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar, South Korean Won, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, and Japanese Yen.  During YTD 2023, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates consisted primarily of the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the Russian Ruble. The market risk related to the foreign currency exchange rates is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on a weighted average of the market rates in effect during the relevant period. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would result in a net decrease in net income of $1.7 million for YTD 2023. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would result in a net increase in net income of $2.0 million for YTD 2023. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $0.1 million decrease in net income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $0.1 million net increase in net income for YTD 2023. Given a net loss for our Russian subsidiary in YTD 2023, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Ruble would result in a $0.9 million increase in net income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Ruble would result in a net decrease in net income of approximately $1.1 million for YTD 2023.
The geographic areas outside the United States in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary. Nonetheless, these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from, among other things, certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in U.S. dollars rather than their respective functional currencies. The net impact of foreign currency transactions on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss) were losses of $(0.1) million and $(1.6) million in YTD 2023 and YTD 2022, respectively. 31 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.5 million in notional forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to currencies. These forward contracts were in place to offset in part the foreign currency exchange risk to intercompany payables due from our foreign operations to be settled in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2022, the Company could not secure foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to the Russian Ruble. See Note 3, “Fair Value Measurements” to our unaudited condensed financial statements included above in Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this quarterly report for further information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts. We estimate that our sales were negatively impacted by $11.2 million in YTD 2023 when compared to foreign exchange translation rates that were in effect in YTD 2022. Foreign currency impact on revenue is calculated by comparing actual current period revenue in U.S. dollars to the theoretical U.S. Dollar revenue we would have achieved based on the weighted-average foreign exchange rates in effect in the comparative prior periods for all applicable foreign currencies. At each balance sheet date, we translate our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency to U.S. dollars. The balances of our foreign equity accounts are translated at their historical value. The difference between the current rates and the historical rates are posted to our currency translation account and reflected in the shareholders’ equity section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized effects of foreign currency translations were losses of $17.6 million and $3.8 million in YTD 2023 and YTD 2022, respectively. The comparative decrease in YTD 2023 foreign currency translation losses is primarily due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar as compared to YTD 2022. Foreign currency translation gains or losses are reported as part of comprehensive income or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss). Foreign currency transactions gains and losses are included in net income or loss as part of other income and expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss).      Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk relating to debt.  Borrowings under our Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility incur interest expense that is variable in relation to the LIBOR and CDOR rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had $108.3 million of outstanding principal under our Term Loan Facilities and $24.5 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rates on the Term Loan Facilities on December 31, 2022 were 5.93%
for the Canadian Term Loan Facility,
5.42%
for the U.S. Term Loan Facility, and 5.63%
for the
U.S. Revolving Credit Facility. Based on the outstanding borrowings, a 1% change in the interest rate would result in a $1.1 million increase or decrease, as applicable, in our annual interest expense.
Commodity price risk.   We use various commodity-based raw materials in our manufacturing processes. Generally, we acquire such components at market prices and do not typically enter into long-term purchase commitments with suppliers or hedging instruments to mitigate commodity price risk. As a result, we are subject to market risks related to changes in commodity prices and supplies of key components of our products. Raw material costs have been stable historically; however, in recent periods we have experienced, and may continue to experience, various shortages in certain raw materials as well as an increase in costs of these materials due to: use of alternate suppliers, higher freight costs, increased lead times, and expedited shipping. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to mitigate temporary raw material shortages or be able to pass along such cost increases, including the potential impacts of tariffs or supply chain challenges, to our customers in the future, and if we are unable to do so, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II
