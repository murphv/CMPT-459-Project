Table of Contents AZENTA, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) ​ ​ 1. Nature of Operation
Azenta, Inc. (“Azenta”, or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of life sciences sample exploration and management solutions for the life sciences market.
The Company supports its customers from research to clinical development with its sample management, automated storage, and genomic services expertise to help bring impactful therapies to market faster. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the markets it serves, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in customer demand, acceptance of new products, development by its
competitors
of new technological innovations, risk of disruption in its supply chain, the implementation of tariffs and export controls, inflation, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with domestic and foreign regulatory authorities and agencies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had varying impacts on our financial results.
In the first two years of the pandemic, any marginal adverse impact was more than offset by incremental orders related to virus research, COVID testing and vaccine development and commercialization in 2021 and through the first half of 2022. There has been limited COVID-related demand after the second fiscal quarter of 2022, and therefore, our revenue trends since then have been negatively impacted when compared to prior periods.
Future impacts on the Company’s financial results are not fully determinable, as the continuing impact of the pandemic on the economy and markets which the Company serves is as yet unknown, but will be dependent, in part, on future variants of the virus and vaccine effectiveness against these variants and new or prolonged government responses to the pandemic.
The Company’s financial results will also depend on variables including reduced demand from its customers, the degree that the supply chain may be constrained which could impact its delivery of products and services and the potential negative impact on its operations if there is an outbreak among the Company’s employees, as well as the amount of incremental demand caused by research and treatments in the areas of COVID-19 or related threats. ​ ​ 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of December 31, 2022, and its results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2022 was derived from audited annual financial statements but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted and, accordingly, the accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). 8
Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are associated with recording accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations, long-lived assets, derivative financial instruments, deferred income taxes, warranty obligations, revenue over time, and stock-based compensation expense. The Company assesses the estimates on an ongoing basis and records changes in estimates in the period they occur and become known. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the Company’s business, including results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. This includes results from new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and any actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets. The Company has made estimates of the impact of COVID-19 within its financials. ​ Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ​ Significant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, as well as intangibles and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations may be based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as our current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates that may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results. ​ Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the arrangement is settled. ​ Foreign Currency Translation Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other income (expenses), net” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $ 0.9
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses were $ 1.9
million during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The determination of the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is based on their financial and operational environment and is the local currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency at period-end exchange rates, while revenue, expenses, gains and losses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translations are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and
9
Table of Contents presented as a component of comprehensive income or loss in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (loss).
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these transactions carry foreign exchange risk in Germany, the United Kingdom and China. The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations. The arrangements typically mature in three months or less and they do not qualify for hedge accounting. Net gains and losses related to these contracts are recorded as a component of “Other income (expenses), net” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and are as follows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

Table of Contents Hedging Activities
On February 1, 2022, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the United States dollar and the Euro. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreement, the Company notionally exchanged approximately
$ 1.03
billion for approximately
€ 915
million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately
1.196 % . The designated notional amount is
$ 960
million and the actual interest rate is
1.283 % .
The
1.283 %
rate was in the range of the market value for that day and is the true interest rate on the notional amount. The Company designated the cross-currency swap as a hedge of net investments against one of our Euro denominated subsidiaries which requires an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. At the maturity of the cross currency-swap on February 1, 2023, the Company delivered a notional amount of
€ 852
million and received a notional amount of
$ 960
million at an exchange rate of
1.1261 , which includes a gain of
$ 29.2
million.
This cross-currency swap is marked to market at each reporting period, representing the fair values of the cross-currency swap and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive items, net,” on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Interest accrued on the cross-currency swap is recorded within “Interest income” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss of
$ 57.1
million to “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” and recorded “Interest income” of
$ 3.1
million on this instrument for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration liability and derivative instruments at fair value. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820,
Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC 820”) establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices or observable inputs other than quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities. Contingent consideration liabilities that are recorded at fair value are based on level 3 inputs. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses and Sales Returns Trade accounts receivable do not bear interest and are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses representing its best estimate of expected credit losses related to its existing accounts receivable and their net realizable value. The Company determines the allowance based on a number of factors, including an evaluation of customer credit worthiness, the age of the outstanding receivables, economic trends, historical experience and other information over the payment periods. The Company reviews and adjusts the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the Company determines that the balances are not recoverable. Provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company determines the allowance for sales returns based on its best estimate of expected customer returns. Provisions for sales returns are recorded in "Revenue" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Leases The Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate and finance leases for non-real estate.
The classification of a lease as operating or finance and the determination of the right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and lease liability are determined at lease inception. The ROU asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, an incremental borrowing rate is used based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar
11
Table of Contents term of the lease payments at commencement date. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company’s lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. Fixed payments for non-lease components are combined with lease payments and accounted for as a single lease component which increases the amount of the ROU asset and liability. The ROU asset for operating leases is included within “Other assets” and the ROU asset for finance leases is included within “Property, plant, and equipment, net” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term lease liabilities for both operating leases and finance leases are included within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term lease liabilities for operating leases and finance leases are included within “Long-term operating lease liabilities”, and “Other long-term liabilities”, respectively, in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Discontinued Operations Disposition of Semiconductor Automation Business
On September 20, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor automation business to THL and the Company determined that the semiconductor automation business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the Company’s financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $ 2.9
billion in cash. As part of the transaction, the Company recorded an $ 18.1
million liability related to retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards for former employees of the Company that were conveyed with the transaction.
The Company paid
$ 0.6
million during the year ended September 30, 2022 and remitted the remaining payments to THL in November 2022, and THL directly paid the Company’s former employees.
Following the completion of the sale, the Company no longer serves the semiconductor market. In connection with the closing of the sale, the Company and THL entered into a transition services agreement, to which both the Company and THL will provide each other with certain transition services related to finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, compliance, facilities, legal and research and development support, for time periods ranging from
three
to
24 months .
In addition, the Company entered into
two
separate lease agreements for leases back to the Company for portions of the facilities that previously served as its corporate headquarters in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and were sold to THL as part of the sale agreement.
Each lease provides for

The Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Marketable securities reported as current assets represent investments that mature within one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term marketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date.
Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets until the security is sold or matures. Gains or losses realized from sales of marketable securities are computed based on the specific identification method and recognized as a component of "Other income (expenses), net" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had sales and maturities of marketable securities of $ 607.2
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. There were insignificant sales of marketable securities in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The following is a summary of the amortized cost and the fair value, including accrued interest receivable as well as unrealized gains (losses) on the short-term and long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​      Gross      Gross      ​ ​ ​ Amortized ​ Unrealized  ​ Unrealized  ​ ​ ​ ​ Cost ​ Losses ​ Gains ​ Fair Value December 31, 2022:

Table of Contents The Company reviews the marketable securities for impairment at each reporting period to determine if any of the securities have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. The Company considers factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company believes that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, it writes down the investment to its fair value and recognizes the credit loss in earnings and the non-credit loss in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of the available evidence.
​ 5. Business Combinations The Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the following acquisitions at their fair values as of the acquisition date, from a market participant’s perspective. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results of operations. The finalization of the assignment of fair values will be completed within one year after the respective acquisition date.
Acquisition Completed in Fiscal Year 2023 ​ B Medical Systems S.á r.l. ​ On
October 3, 2022 , the Company acquired B Medical Systems S.á r.l. and its subsidiaries ("B Medical"), for a purchase price of approximately $ 432.2
million including contingent consideration, which the company estimated the fair value to be $ 17
million as of the measurement date. B Medical is a market leader in temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions that enables the delivery of life-saving treatments to more than
150
countries worldwide. B Medical’s results of operations are reported in the Company’s Life Sciences Products reportable segment from the date of acquisition. The Company paid a total initial cash purchase price at closing of $ 424
million, as adjusted for cash acquired and other items pursuant to the Agreement. B Medical Systems Holdings S.A (the “Seller”) is eligible to earn up to approximately € 50
million in contingent consideration based upon achievement of certain financial metrics by B Medical and its subsidiaries. Included in the purchase price, the Company repaid B Medical’s outstanding debt of $ 43.1
million prior to September 30, 2022 which was classified in prepaid assets as of September 30, 2022. In addition, as of September 30, 2022, the Company had recorded $ 381
million in short-term restricted cash, which was reserved to complete the acquisition on October 3, 2022.
The contingent consideration payment is based on achievement of certain revenue targets over the
one-year
period from October 3, 2022 to September 30, 2023.
Pursuant to ASC 805,
Business Combinations
(“ASC 805”), the Company recorded its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation based on future revenue projections, revenue growth rates of comparable companies, implied volatility and applying a risk adjusted discount rate.
Each quarter, the Company is required to remeasure the fair value of this liability as assumptions change over time and any resulting adjustments in the fair value of this liability are recorded in “Operating expenses” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
This fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.
This fair value measurement is directly impacted by the Company’s estimate of future incremental revenue growth of the business.
Accordingly, if actual revenue growth is higher or lower than the estimates within the fair value measurement, the Company would record additional charges or gains.
As of December 31, 2022, the contingent consideration liability was
$ 18.5
million. The total purchase price was allocated to B Medical’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values as of October 3, 2022, as set forth below:

432,160 ​ In performing the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of B Medical’s business. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as the Company continues to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities. As part of the purchase price allocations, the Company determined the identifiable intangible assets were completed technology, trademarks, customer relationships and backlog.
The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using the income approach, and the cash flow projections were discounted using a
13 %
rate.
The cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rate applied was benchmarked with references to the implied rate of return from the transaction and the weighted average cost of capital.
The weighted average life of completed technology is
10 years , customer relationships is
16 years , trademarks is
5 years
and backlog is
1 year .
The intangible assets acquired are amortized over their respective weighted average life using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
The calculation of the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded to goodwill.
Goodwill of
$ 219.1
million largely reflects the potential expansion of the Company's cold chain capabilities by adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature controlled specimens in the Company's Life Sciences Products reportable segment. The goodwill is
not
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The revenues and net loss from B Medical included in the Company's consolidated results for the reporting period since acquisition were $ 41.8
million and $ 4.7
million, respectively. The Company incurred $ 8.7
million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of which $ 4.7
million was incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022.  The following unaudited pro forma information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition had taken place on October 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction actually occurred at the beginning of these periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

million of transaction costs, $ 5.4
million of reversal of debt interest expense and $ 1.6
million expensed as a reversal of R&D capitalization.  The pro forma information does not include any anticipated costs savings or other effects of the integration of B Medical.  Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations.
​ Acquisition Completed in Fiscal Year 2022 ​ Barkey Holding GmbH ​ On
July 1, 2022 , the Company acquired Barkey Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (“Barkey”), a leading provider of controlled-rate thawing devices for customers in the medical, biotech and pharmaceutical industries, head quartered in Leopoldshöhe, Germany. The Company has included the financial results of the acquired operations within the Life Sciences Products segment. The total cash purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $ 84.8
million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition brings innovative products and capabilities that extend the Company’s extensive cold chain of condition portfolio of products and services, while also expanding our customer reach in the fast-growing cell and gene therapy space. The allocation of the consideration included $ 3.0
million of customer relationships, $ 29.0
million of technology, $ 57.8
million of goodwill, $ 9.8
million of deferred tax liabilities, and several other assets and liabilities. The weighted useful life of all the intangible assets acquired is
15 years . The goodwill and intangibles are
not
tax deductible. The Company did not present a pro forma information summary for its consolidated results of operations for the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2022 because such results were immaterial. ​ 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of net book value over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. The Company elected April 1 st
as its annual goodwill impairment assessment date. If the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that fair values of the reporting units are below their carrying values, the Company performs additional impairment tests during interim periods to evaluate goodwill for impairment. No triggering events indicating goodwill impairment occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Please refer to Note 8, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal year 2022. In accordance with ASC 350,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , the Company initially assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, it performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting exceeds its carrying value. 18

​ 8. Income Taxes
The
Company
recorded
an
income
tax
benefit
of
$ 4.6
million
during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The benefit was primarily driven by the pre-tax loss from operations and a $ 1.3
million deferred tax benefit resulting from the extension of a tax incentive in China.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 4.7
million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The tax benefit was primarily driven by a $ 4.8
million discrete stock compensation windfall benefit for tax deductions that exceeded the associated book compensation expense.
​ The
Company
evaluates
the
realizability
of
its
deferred
tax
assets
by tax-paying
component and
assesses the
need for
a valuation
allowance
on
an annual and a quarterly basis.
The Company evaluates
the profitability of
each
tax-paying component
on
a
historical
cumulative
basis
and
a
forward-looking
basis
in the course of
performing
this
analysis.
The
Company maintains
a U.S.
valuation
allowance
related
to the
realizability of
certain
state tax
credits and
state
net
operating loss carry-forwards,
as
well
as a
valuation
allowance
against net
deferred
tax
assets
on certain
foreign
tax-paying components as of December 31, 2022. The Company has generated recent pre-tax tax losses but is in an overall deferred tax liability position where future taxable temporary differences are sufficient to offset future deductible temporary differences. The Company continues to monitor historical cumulative income and may record an adjustment to the valuation allowance if there is a shift to the deferred tax asset position in a future period. The Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities involve judgment and estimation, and they are monitored based on the best information available. The Company recognizes interest related to
21
Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits as
a component
of the income tax provision
or benefit.
The Company recognized minimal interest
expense
related
to
its
unrecognized
tax
benefits
during
the
three
months
ended
December 31, 2022. The
Company is subject to
U.S. federal,
state,
local and foreign income taxes in various
jurisdictions.
The amount
of
income
taxes
paid
is
subject
to
the
Company’s
interpretation
of
applicable
tax
laws
in
the
jurisdictions
in which it files. In
the
normal course of
business,
the
Company is
subject
to
income tax
audits in
various
global
jurisdictions
in which
it
operates.
The
years
subject
to
examination
vary
for
the
U.S.
and
international
jurisdictions,
with
the
earliest tax
year being
2017 . Based on the
outcome
of
these
examinations
or
the
expiration
of
statutes
of
limitations
for specific jurisdictions,
it
is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently anticipates that it is reasonably possible that
the unrecognized
tax benefits
and
accrued
interest
on those benefits will be reduced by
$ 1.6
million
in the next twelve months
due to
statute of limitations expirations. These
unrecognized tax benefits would impact the
effective tax rate if recognized. ​ ​ 9. Other Balance Sheet Information The following is a summary of accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ September 30,  ​ ​      2022      2022      Accounts receivable ​ $

The Company may issue to eligible employees options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, restricted stock and other equity incentives which vest upon the satisfaction of a performance condition and/or a service condition. In addition, the Company issues shares to participating employees pursuant to an employee stock purchase plan, and stock awards and deferred restricted stock units to its directors in accordance with its director compensation program.
The stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units for continuing operations was $ 1.9
million and $ 2.6
million, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The stock-based compensation expense for employee stock purchase plan for continuing operations was $ 0.3

694 ​ Total stock-based compensation expense ​ $
2,105 ​ $
7,891 ​ ​ The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the Company’s common stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant. For awards that vest based on
23
Table of Contents service conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that vest subject to performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense ratably over the performance period if it is probable that performance condition will be met and adjusted for the probability percentage of achieving the performance goals. The Company makes estimates of stock award forfeitures and the number of awards expected to vest. The Company considers many factors in developing forfeiture estimates, including award types, employee classes and historical experience. Each quarter, the Company assesses the probability of achieving the performance goals. Current estimates may differ from actual results and future changes in estimates. The Company grants restricted stock units that vest over a required service period and/or achievement of certain operating performance goals. Restricted stock units granted with performance goals may also have a required service period following the achievement of all or a portion of the performance goals. The following table reflects restricted stock units and stock awards, granted during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​      Time-Based      Stock      Performance- ​ ​ Total Units ​ Units ​ Grants ​ Based Units Three months ended December 31, 2022

59,776
24    89,548 ​ Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants Restricted stock units granted with a required service period typically have
three-year
vesting schedules in which
one-third
of awards vest at the first anniversary of the grant date,
one-third
vest at the second anniversary of the grant date and
one-third
vest at the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the award holders meeting service requirements. Stock-Based Awards – Board of Directors
The stock-based awards granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors include stock awards, restricted stock awards, deferred stock and restricted stock units.
Certain members of the Board of Directors have elected to defer receiving their annual stock awards and related quarterly dividends until they attain a certain age or cease to provide services as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Annual deferred restricted stock units granted during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were vested upon issuance.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants Performance-based restricted stock units are earned based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The criteria for performance-based awards are weighted and have threshold, target and maximum performance goals.
Performance-based awards granted in fiscal year 2023, 2022 and 2021 allow participants to earn
100 % of the restricted stock units if the Company’s performance meets or exceeds its target goal for each applicable financial metric, and up to a maximum of
200 % if the Company’s performance for such metrics meets or exceeds the maximum or stretch goal. Performance below the minimum threshold for each financial metric results in award forfeiture. Performance goals will be measured over a
three-year
period for each year’s awards and at the end of the period to determine the number of units earned by recipients who continue to meet the service requirement. Around the third anniversary of each year’s awards’ grant date, the Company’s Board of Directors determines the number of units earned for participants who continue to meet the service requirements on the vest date. 24

6.1
million shares of common stock from the Dealer, representing approximately
70 %

The final number of shares to be repurchased by the Company will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement. At settlement, the Dealer may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company, or under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment, at its election, to the Dealer. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement is scheduled to occur by the end of the Company’s third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances, as set forth in the ASR Agreement.

million in revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 from contract liability.
​ Remaining Performance Obligations.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations within contracts with an original expected contract term that is greater than one year and for which fulfillment of the contract has started as of the end of the reporting period. The aggregate amount of transaction consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 was $ 89.8
million. The following table summarizes when the Company expects to recognize the remaining performance

89,767 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cost to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract The Company capitalizes sales commissions when incurred if they are (i) incremental costs of obtaining a contract, (ii) expected to be recovered and (iii) have an expected amortization period that is greater than one year. As part of the Company’s cumulative effect adjustment upon the initial adoption of ASC 606, incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract were capitalized and have been classified as deferred commissions within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts primarily relate to sales commissions and are being amortized over a
60-month
period, which represents the average period of contract performance. The Company did not capitalize any sales commissions during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as the amount of sales commissions that qualified for capitalization during the reporting period was insignificant. Sales commissions incurred during the reporting period have been expensed as incurred. These costs are recorded within “Selling, general and administrative” expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company has concluded that none of its costs incurred in fulfillment of customer contracts meet the capitalization criteria. The Company will account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities and recognize the associated expense when control of the product has transferred to the customer.
​ 14. Segment and Geographic Information Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The Company operates in
two
reportable segments: the Life Sciences Products segment and the Life Sciences Services segment. These reportable segments also represent the Company’s operating segments .

​ 15. Significant Customers
The Company had one individual customer that accounted for
20 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This individual customer is a distributor shipping to end users in
17
countries. This customer also accounted for
12 % of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. The Company had no individual customer that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2022. ​ 16. Commitments and Contingencies Tariff Matter In fiscal year 2021, as part of the Company’s continued integration of GENEWIZ, which was acquired in November 2018, the Company initiated a review during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with the assistance of a third party consultant, of the transaction value that the Company has used to calculate tariffs on inter-company imports of samples shipped from its GENEWIZ business. As a result of the third-party review and in light of a new interpretation surrounding the valuation method used to calculate the estimated transaction value, the Company revised its estimate of the tariffs owed as a result and recorded a liability of $ 6.1
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company submitted a payment in the amount of $ 5.9
million to the customs authorities during 2022, related to November 2021 and prior periods. The customs authorities will review the Company’s calculation of tariffs for these periods and determine if any further tariffs are owed. The Company does not expect to incur any significant penalties associated with the tariffs.
Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2022, the Company had non-cancellable commitments of $ 65.4
million, comprised of purchase orders for inventory of $ 38.7
million and information technology related commitments of $ 26.7
million. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. The Company may also have certain indemnification obligations pursuant to claims made under the definitive agreement it entered into with Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) in connection with the Company’s sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal
30
Table of Contents year 2018.
However, as of the date of this report, the Company believes that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Edwards asserted claims for indemnification under the definitive agreement relating to alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to customer warranty claims and inventory .In addition, in January 2023, Edwards filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York seeking indemnification from the Company under such definitive agreement with respect to a third-party warranty claim, that was included as part of their initial claims, of approximately
$ 1.0
million and other related damages, including interest and attorney’s fees.
The Company cannot determine the probability of any losses or outcome of these claims including the amount of any indemnifiable losses, if any, resulting from these claims at this time, however, the Company believes that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. If the resolution of these claims results in indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable indemnification deductibles and indemnification escrow established under the definitive agreement, Edwards would be required to seek recovery under the representation and warranty insurance Edwards obtained in connection with the closing of the transaction.
The Company believes that any indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable deductibles and indemnification escrow established in the definitive agreement would be covered by such insurance.
If Edwards is unable to obtain recovery under its insurance, however, it could seek recovery of such indemnifiable losses, if any, directly from the Company. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, there can be no assurance that the Company’s assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome, and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. ​ 17. Fair Value Measurement
The fair value measurement guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value: ​ Level 1 Inputs:
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset and liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 Inputs:
Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Inputs:
Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities and reflect an entity’s own assumptions in pricing assets or liabilities since they are supported by little or no market activity. The Company measures certain assets, including the cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. ​ 31

Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.
Available-For-Sale Securities
Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of municipal securities, bank certificate of deposits and U.S. government-backed securities, and as such are classified as Level 1.
Investments classified as Level 2 consist of debt securities that are valued using matrix pricing and benchmarking because they are not actively traded. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. 32
Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Contracts
Foreign exchange contract assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value based on observable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of an active market for these contracts. Net Investment Hedge
Net investment hedge assets are measured and reported at fair value based on observable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of an active market for these contracts. Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration
Acquisition-related contingent consideration is measured and reported at fair value using the real options method based on the unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value and classified with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The amount is contingent based on the acquired business’ performance for a one-year period from October 3, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Please refer to Note 5, “Business Combinations” for further detail. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the arrangement is settled. There were no changes to the fair value of contingent consideration for the period ended December 31, 2022. Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
​ 18. Subsequent Event ​ On
February 2, 2023 , the Company acquired Ziath Ltd and its subsidiaries (‘Ziath’).
Based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, Ziath is a leading provider of 2D barcode readers for life sciences applications. Founded in 2005, Ziath’s innovative 2D barcode readers are a key component of the laboratory automation workflow serving pharmaceutical, biotech and academic customers worldwide.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, describes principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition and liquidity as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates that require significant judgment and thus have the most significant potential impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our MD&A is organized as follows: ● Overview . This section provides a general description of our business and operating segments as well as a brief discussion and overall analysis of our business and financial performance, including key developments affecting the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ● Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
This section discusses accounting policies and estimates that require us to exercise subjective or complex judgments in their application. We believe these accounting policies and estimates are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. ● Results of Operations.
This section provides an analysis of our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. ● Liquidity and Capital Resources.
This section provides an analysis of our liquidity and changes in cash flows as well as a discussion of contractual commitments. You should read the MD&A in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the related MD&A contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on November 25, 2022, or the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read “Information Related to Forward-Looking Statements” below for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. ​ Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic We have implemented business continuity plans designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize the disruption to ongoing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had varying impacts on our financial results.
In the first two years of the pandemic, any marginal adverse impact was more than offset by incremental orders related to virus research, COVID testing and vaccine development and commercialization in 2021 and through the first half of 2022. There has been limited COVID-related demand after the second fiscal quarter of 2022, and therefore, our revenue trends since then have been negatively impacted when compared to prior periods.
During the third quarter ended June 30, 2022, we experienced a two-week facility closure in Suzhou, China. as a result of local government protocols and mandates. We will continue monitoring and assessing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including as a result of the elimination of COVID-related restrictions in China. Our financial results will also depend on variables including reduced demand from our customers, the degree that the supply chain may be constrained which could impact our delivery of products and services and the potential negative impact on our operations if there is an outbreak among our employees, as well as the amount of incremental demand caused by research and treatments in the areas of COVID-19 or related threats.

43,320 ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Results of Operations –
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 28% as compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year period driven by an 80% increase in our Life Sciences Products segment primarily due to the acquisition of B Medical and Barkey. Gross margin was 41.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 48.0% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses increased $34.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, mainly driven by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, with some increase in research and development expenses. We reported an operating loss of $27.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to operating loss of $0.3 million for the corresponding prior fiscal year period mainly due to the increase in operating expenses. Loss from continuing operations was $11.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a profit of $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a $0.0 million net income from discontinued operations as compared to income of $40.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
​ December 31, 2022 Compared to September 30, 2022 Cash Flows and Liquidity -
Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as presented on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is on a total company basis and were $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to $2.3 billion as of September 30,  2022. The decrease of $861 million was attributable primarily to outflows of $373 million related to the purchase of B Medical and $500 million related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into in November 2022. Cash outflows for operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $27.0 million, primarily due to payment of retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards for the semiconductor automation business. Investing inflows of $56.4 million include $607 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by $12.8 million for capital expenditures and $371.6 million paid for the acquisition of B Medical.
Financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 include the outflows related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement. The effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced our cash balance by $50 million as of December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, intangible assets, goodwill, inventories, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions, both in general and specifically in relation to the life science industry, that serve as a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily determinable based on information from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our Life Sciences Products segment revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 80% as compared to the corresponding prior year period driven by the acquisitions of B Medical and Barkey. Excluding B Medical and Barkey, we experienced decreased demand and associated revenue for COVID-19 related consumables and instruments; which was partially offset by increased revenue in our automated cold sample management systems.
Our Life Sciences Service segment revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 1% as compared to the corresponding prior year period driven by a 4% year-over-year decrease in our genomics business; mainly from lower synthesis revenue. Sample repository solutions revenue increased 7% year-over-year, attributable to higher revenue from storage services.
We estimate that revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $1 million in the aggregate as compared to COVID-19-related revenue of approximately $11 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in this revenue was primarily due to lower demand for consumables related to COVID-19 testing. Revenue generated outside the United States was $90.6 million, or 51% of total revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $50.1 million, or 36% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. One customer accounted for 20% of our consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This individual customer is a distributor shipping to end users in 17 countries. There were no customers with more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021. 39

The increase in operating loss was due to an increase in operating expense of $34.2 million, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $6.8 million. Within operating expenses, research and development expenses increased $1.1 million and selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $31.9 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher merger and acquisition costs and costs related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into in November 2022, as well as continued investment in the business to build out the commercial and laboratory support infrastructure.
Life Sciences Products segment adjusted operating income decreased $1.1 million and adjusted operating margin decreased 5.1 percentage points for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year period.
The decrease in adjusted operating income was driven by an increase in operating expenses of $18.3 million (primarily due to the addition of B Medical), partially offset by an increase in gross margin of $10.3 million.
Adjusted operating income for our Life Sciences Products segment excludes charges for amortization related to completed technology of $2.9 million and $0.2 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and $2.8 million purchase accounting impact on inventory for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Please refer to Note 14, “Segment Information” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Life Sciences Services segment adjusted operating income decreased $10.9 million and adjusted operating margin decreased 12.5 percentage points for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year period.
The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven by higher operating expenses of $7.4 million and a decrease in gross margin of $3.5 million.
Adjusted operating income for our Life Sciences Services segment excludes charges for amortization related to completed technology of $1.3 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Life Sciences Products segment gross margin decreased 8.7 percentage points for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding fiscal year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting inventory basis for B Medical.
Cost of revenue included $2.9 million amortization of completed technology and $2.9 million for purchase accounting impact on inventory for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $0.2 million of charges for amortization related to completed technology for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Excluding the impact of the amortization of completed technology and purchase accounting impact on inventory, margins decreased 2.7 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the mix of products sold in our consumables and instruments and cryogenic stores businesses.
Life Sciences Services segment gross margin decreased 3.3 percentage points driven by decreased gross margin in both the genomic services business and sample repository solutions business. The decrease in the genomic services business was due to the impact of lower sales, higher labor costs and continued investment in the business. The decrease in gross margin in the sample repository solutions business is mainly driven by higher labor costs and lower transport sales. Cost of revenue included $1.3 million and $1.6 million of charges for amortization related to completed technology for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Excluding the impact of the amortization of completed technology, Life Sciences Services margins decreased 3.6 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. ​ ​ 41

Unallocated corporate expenses increased $7.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year period primarily due to higher merger and acquisition costs and costs related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into in November 2022.
Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges increased by $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The three months ended December 31, 2022 includes restructuring charges related to the separation of personnel.
Costs savings from these actions are expected to be realized in the next twelve months.
Non-Operating Income (Expenses)
Interest income –
We recorded interest income of $10.7 million for the three months ended December 31 2022, as compared to $0.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. This increase in interest income is due to interest earned on the proceeds from the sale of the semiconductor automation business, including interest accrued on a net investment hedge, during the three month period ended December 31, 2022.
Please refer to the
Derivative Financial Instruments
section of Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Interest expense –
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we recorded interest expense of $0.0 million as compared to $0.5 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our previously outstanding term loan was settled on February 1, 2022 using the proceeds from the sale of the semiconductor automation business.
Other income (expenses), net –
We recorded other income of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The change for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year period is primarily due to foreign exchange gains in the 2022 period, but losses in the 2021 period.
​ Income Tax Provision / Benefit We recorded
an

benefit
of
$4.6
million
during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The benefit
was primarily driven by the pre-tax loss from operations and a $1.3 million deferred tax benefit resulting from the extension of a tax incentive in China.
We recorded an income tax benefit $4.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The tax benefit was primarily driven by a $4.8 million discrete stock compensation windfall benefit for tax deductions that exceeded the associated book compensation expense. Discontinued Operations There was no revenue from discontinued operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Revenue from discontinued operations was $203.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. There was no net income from discontinued operation for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net Income from discontinued operations was $37 million for the three months ended December31, 2021. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by our company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor automation business, and which remained as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.

Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We believe that we have adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. The current global economic environment, including the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, make it difficult for us to predict longer-term liquidity requirements with sufficient certainty. We may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results
​ The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows stated on a total company consolidated basis and excludes the impact of discontinued operations. Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 consist of the following (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      September 30, 2022      Cash and cash equivalents ​ $

As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $615.9 million, of which $521.8 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for the United States operations, we would need to repatriate these funds.  As a result of changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in U.S. federal income tax. We had marketable securities of $828 million and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without a material adverse impact.
Cash outflows for operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $27.0 million, primarily due to payment of retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards for the semiconductor automation business. Investing inflows of $53 million include $607 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by $12.8 million for capital expenditures and $372 million paid for the acquisition of B Medical.
Financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 include $500 million of outflows related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement. The effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced our cash balance by $50 million as of December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents Capital Resources Share Repurchase Program On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $50 million of our common stock, or the 2015 Repurchase Program. On November 4, 2022, our Board of Directors terminated the 2015 Repurchase Program and approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, or the 2022 Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions (including under an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement), or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock under the 2022 Repurchase Program, and share repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of the 2022 Repurchase Program, we entered into an ASR agreement for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock on November 23, 2022, and repurchased and retired 6.1 million shares. See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about the ASR agreement. Contractual Obligations and Requirements At December 31, 2022, we had non-cancellable commitments of $65.4 million, comprised primarily of purchase orders for inventory of $38.7 million, and information technology related commitments of $26.7 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2022, we had no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. ​ Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting investment return on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term and long-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Exposure Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist principally of money market securities that are short-term in nature. At December 31, 2022, our aggregate short-term and long-term investments were $828 million, consisting mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities and municipal securities. At December 31, 2022, we had $783 million amount of securities in an unrealized loss position. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.8 million change in interest income earned during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
On February 1, 2022, in connection with the completion of the sale of its semiconductor automation business, we used $49.7 million of the cash proceeds from the sale of the semiconductor automation business to extinguish the total remaining outstanding balance of our former term loan. We also closed our revolving credit facility of which had no borrowings.
The term loan had a variable interest rate which subjected us to interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate risk exposure resulted from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate. Currency Rate Exposure We have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these transactions carrying foreign exchange risk are in Germany, the United Kingdom, and China. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 24% and 38% of our total sales, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries, which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale. 45
Table of Contents In the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $102.8 million and $80.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, and primarily relate to the Euro, British Pound, and the Chinese yuan. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency gains of $0.9 million and losses of $1.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021 would result in an approximate change of $1.4 million and less than $3.1 million, respectively, in our net income during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this report, and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, the Company’s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. In October 2022, we acquired B Medical Systems S.á r.l. and its subsidiaries (“B Medical”). We are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of B Medical and integrating B Medical into our internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with SEC Staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for a period of one year following the date on which the acquisition is completed, we have excluded B Medical’s internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The total assets and total revenues of B Medical represent 11% and 23%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 5, “Business Combinations – Acquisition Completed in Fiscal Year 2023” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Change in Internal Controls . Except for the acquisition of B Medical noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings
We are subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. However, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that our assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. ​ Item 1A.
Risk Factors You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We may disclose changes to risk factors or additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

1,000 ​ ​ (1) On November 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, or the 2022 Repurchase Program, and terminated our previously authorized $50 million share repurchase program. On November 23, 2022, as part of the 2022 Repurchase Program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or the ASR Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, or the Dealer, for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock.
Approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock, representing approximately 70% of the total shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement were received by us and retired and the Average Price Paid Per Share is calculated based on 70% of the amount we initially paid under the ASR Agreement and the number of shares of common stock initially delivered to us. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement, and the average price paid per share, will be determined at the settlement of the ASR Agreement and will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement.
