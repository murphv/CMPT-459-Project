Commitments and Contingencies On March 17, 2022, Walter E. Ryan and Ryan Asset Management, LLC, purported stockholders of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), filed a putative class action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (C.A. No. 2022—0255) against the Company and the former directors of Maxim. The complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duties by the individual defendants in connection with Maxim’s agreement, as part of the merger negotiations with the Company, to suspend Maxim dividends for up to four quarters prior to the closing of the Company's acquisition of Maxim. The complaint further alleges that the Company aided and abetted that alleged breach of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs seek damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plaintiffs’ costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees, costs and other expenses. The Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to these allegations; however, the Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential losses, if any.

Revenue Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which the Company’s product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and the Company's methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, the Company reclassifies revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of revenue within, each end market.

Derivatives Foreign Exchange Exposure Management  — The total notional amounts of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments of cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Philippine Pesos, Thai Baht, South Korean Won and Japanese Yen as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were $ 310.3
million and $ 307.1
million, respectively.
The fair values of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were as follows: Fair Value At Balance Sheet Location January 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 8,631   $ —   Forward foreign currency exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ —   $ 18,050   As of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the total notional amounts of undesignated hedges related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts were $ 334.9

The following table presents the gross amounts of the Company's forward foreign currency exchange contract derivative assets and liabilities and the net amounts recorded in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:   January 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 Gross amounts of recognized liabilities $ ( 1,815 ) $ ( 19,846 ) Gross amount of recognized assets 16,914   2,862   Net assets (liabilities) presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets $ 15,099   $ ( 16,984 ) Interest Rate Exposure Management
— The Company's current and future debt may be subject to interest rate risk.
The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce the effects of changes in interest rates.
During fiscal 2023, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions related to its outstanding $ 1,000.0  million aggregate principal amount of
2.1 % senior unsecured notes (the 2031 Notes) where the Company swapped the notional amount of its $ 1,000.0  million of fixed rate debt at
2.1 % into floating interest rate debt through April 1, 2031. The fair value of the swaps at inception was
zero
and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. The interest rate swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges.
The Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged benchmark interest rate risk and the offsetting gain or loss on the related interest rate swaps were recorded as follows: 10 January 28, 2023 Balance Sheet location Loss on Swaps Gain on Note Accrued liabilities $ 5,078   $ —   Long term debt $ —   $ 5,078   For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on derivatives included in and reclassified out of AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts, see Note 3,

Debt On June 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a
five year
unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 2.5  billion (subject to certain terms and conditions).
In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, replacing the LIBOR interest rate provisions with interest rate provisions based on a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a
10
basis point credit spread adjustment.
After the amendment, revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) at the Company's option.
Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable adjusted term SOFR plus a margin based on the Company's Debt Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) from time to time of between
0.690 % and
1.175 %. As of January 28, 2023, the Company had
no
outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility but may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. Note 12 –
Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 were below the U.S. statutory tax rate of
21.0 %, due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to the Company's operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which it earns income.
The Company's effective tax rate also includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses which began in fiscal 2023 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
The mandatory capitalization requirement decreases the Company's effective tax rate primarily by increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrealized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, could decrease by as much as $ 129.0  million within the next twelve months due to the completion of tax audits, including any administrative appeals.
The Company has numerous audits ongoing throughout the world including: an IRS income tax audit for the fiscal years ended November 3, 2018 and November 2, 2019; a pre-acquisition IRS income tax audit for Maxim's fiscal years ended June 27, 2015 through August 26, 2021; various U.S. state and local audits and various international audits. The Company's U.S. federal income tax returns prior to the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 are no longer subject to examination, except for the applicable Maxim pre-acquisition fiscal years noted above. 11 Note 13 –
New Accounting Pronouncements Standards to Be Implemented Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities.
Under the new guidance (ASC 805-20-30-28), the acquirer should determine what contract assets and/or contract liabilities it would have recorded under ASC 606 (the revenue guidance) as of the acquisition date, as if the acquirer had entered into the original contract at the same date and on the same terms as the acquiree. The recognition and measurement of those contract assets and contract liabilities will likely be comparable to what the acquiree has recorded on its books under ASC 606 as of the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
ASU 2021-08 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended November 2, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, for any period for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
However, adoption in an interim period other than the first fiscal quarter requires an entity to apply the new guidance to all prior business combinations that have occurred since the beginning of the annual period in which the new guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the adoption date of ASU 2021-08 and the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations. Note 14 –
Subsequent Events On February 14, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash dividend of $ 0.86
per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2023 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2023 and is expected to total approximately $ 435.0
million. 12 ITEM 2.

Results of Operations Overview (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and percentages)   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 3,249,630  $ 2,684,293  $ 565,337  21  % Gross margin % 65.4  % 52.2  % Net income $ 961,474  $ 280,077  $ 681,397  243  % Net income as a % of revenue 29.6  % 10.4  % Diluted EPS $ 1.88  $ 0.53  $ 1.35  255  % Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market.
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of revenue within, each end market. 13 Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022   Revenue % of Revenue* Y/Y% Revenue % of Revenue* Industrial $ 1,690,202  52  % 26  % $ 1,340,284  50  % Automotive 718,165  22  % 29  % 557,634  21  % Communications 487,986  15  % 18  % 412,754  15  % Consumer 353,277  11  % (5) % 373,621  14  % Total revenue $ 3,249,630  100  % 21  % $ 2,684,293  100  % * The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding. Revenue increased 21% in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of broad-based demand for our products sold into the Industrial, Automotive and Communications end markets, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the Consumer end market primarily due to weakening market trends. Revenue by Sales Channel The following table summarizes revenue by sales channel.
We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers.
Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.
Three Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Revenue % of Revenue* Revenue % of Revenue* Channel    Distributors $ 2,011,323  62  % $ 1,653,054  62  %    Direct customers 1,195,534  37  % 1,003,181  37  %    Other 42,773  1  % 28,058  1  % Total revenue $ 3,249,630  100  % $ 2,684,293  100  % * The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding. As indicated in the table above, the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel has remained relatively consistent in the periods presented, but can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand. Gross Margin   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross margin $ 2,124,341  $ 1,401,997  $ 722,344  52  % Gross margin % 65.4  % 52.2  % Gross margin percentage increased by 1,320 basis points in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of additional cost of goods sold of $271.4 million related to a nonrecurring fair value adjustment recorded to inventory as a result of the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) included in the three-month period ended January 29, 2022.
The remainder of the increase primarily related to favorable product mix and synergies related to the acquisition of Maxim. Research and Development (R&D)   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change R&D expenses $ 414,095  $ 426,780  $ (12,685) (3) % R&D expenses as a % of revenue 13  % 16  % 14 R&D expenses decreased in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of lower salary and benefit expenses and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher R&D employee-related variable compensation expenses.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth.
We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings.
Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A)   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change SMG&A expenses $ 326,284  $ 297,365  $ 28,919  10  % SMG&A expenses as a % of revenue 10  % 11  % SMG&A expenses increased in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of higher variable compensation expenses, salary and benefit expenses and discretionary spending, partially offset by lower acquisition-related transaction costs. Amortization of Intangibles   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Amortization expenses $ 253,142  $ 253,367  $ (225) —  % Amortization expenses as a % of revenue 8  % 9  % Amortization expenses were relatively flat in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Special Charges, Net   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Special charges, net $ —  $ 59,728  $ (59,728) n/a Special charges, net as a % of revenue —  % 2  % Special charges, net decreased in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of the integration of Maxim and continued organizational initiatives to better align our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan.
Operating Income   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Operating income $ 1,130,820  $ 364,757  $ 766,063  210  % Operating income as a % of revenue 34.8  % 13.6  % The year-over-year increase in operating income in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $565.3 million, which contributed to an increase in gross margin of $722.3 million, and decreases of $59.7 million in special charges, net and $12.7 million in R&D expenses, offset by an increase of $28.9 million in SMG&A expenses . 15 Nonoperating Expense (Income)   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change Total nonoperating expense (income) $ 57,347  $ 41,202  $ 16,145  The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense (income) in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior year was the result of higher interest expense related to our debt obligations and lower net gains from other investments. Provision for Income Taxes   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change Provision for income taxes $ 111,999  $ 43,478  $ 68,521  Effective income tax rate 10.4  % 13.4  % The effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 were below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.
Our pretax income for the three-month periods ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%.
The Company's effective tax rate for the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 also includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses which began in fiscal 2023 under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The mandatory capitalization requirement decreased our effective tax rate primarily by increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. See Note 12,
Income Taxes , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.
Net Income   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Net Income $ 961,474  $ 280,077  $ 681,397  243  % Net Income as a % of revenue 29.6  % 10.4  % Diluted EPS $ 1.88  $ 0.53  Net income increased in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a $766.1 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $68.5 million increase in provision for income taxes and a $16.1 million increase in nonoperating expense (income). Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 28, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was $1,670.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $386.6 million
was held in the United States and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. 16 We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.   Three Months Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,406,305  $ 856,413  Net cash provided by operations as a % of revenue 43  % 32  % Net cash used for investing activities $ (176,056) $ (103,309) Net cash used for financing activities $ (1,030,359) $ (937,268) The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by changes in working capital. Investing Activities Investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities during the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for capital expenditures. Financing Activities
Financing cash flows generally consist of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used for financing activities during the three-month period ended January 28, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of higher common stock repurchases partially offset by the early termination of debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Working Capital January 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 $ Change % Change Accounts receivable $ 1,629,870  $ 1,800,462  $ (170,592) (9) % Days sales outstanding* 48  50  Inventory $ 1,522,942  $ 1,399,914  $ 123,028  9  % Days cost of sales in inventory* 118  107  _______________________________________ * We use the average of the current quarter and prior quarter ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively.
Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory include accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value as a result of the acquisition of Maxim. The decrease in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings. Inventory increased primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
Current liabilities were relatively flat at approximately $2,433.7 million at January 28, 2023 and approximately $2,442.7 million at the end of fiscal 2022.
This was due to higher income taxes payable offset by lower accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 17 Debt
As of January 28, 2023, our debt obligations consisted of the following: Principal Amount Outstanding 2024 Notes, due October 2024 $ 500,000  2025 Notes, due April 2025 400,000  2026 Notes, due December 2026 900,000  Maxim 2027 Notes, due June 2027 59,788  2027 Notes, due June 2027 440,212  2028 Notes, due October 2028 750,000  2031 Notes, due October 2031 1,000,000  2032 Notes, due October 2032 300,000  2036 Notes, due December 2036 144,278  2041 Notes, due October 2041 750,000  2045 Notes, due December 2045 332,587  2051 Notes, due October 2051 1,000,000  Total debt $ 6,576,865  The indentures governing our outstanding notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. Revolving Credit Facility
Our Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021 and as amended, provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions).
We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.
Stock Repurchase Program In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under our common stock repurchase program.
Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of January 28, 2023, an additional $4.3 billion remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options as well as for our employee stock purchase plan. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant.
18 Capital Expenditures Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $176.2 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be between approximately 6% and 8% of revenue, which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to expand internal manufacturing capacity.
These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing.
Dividends On February 14, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.86 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2023 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2023 and is expected to total approximately $435.0 million.
We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods.
The payment of any future quarterly dividends, or a future increase in the quarterly dividend amount, will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Contractual Obligations There have not been any material changes during the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022. New Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 13,
New Accounting Pronouncements,
in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There were no material changes in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 to the information provided under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022.
19 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There were no material changes in the three-month period ended January 28, 2023 to the information provided under Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022 . ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures (a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 28, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 28, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended January 28, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 20 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
