Reverse
Merger
On
May 17, 2021, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Kun Peng
International Holding Limited (“KP International”), a limited liability company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands on April 20, 2021, and (ii) the five members of KP International to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of KP International in exchange for the issuance to those members of an aggregate of
34,158,391
shares of our common stock (“Reverse Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, and as a
condition to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company also agreed to enter into
an agreement with Wenhai Xia (“the Stockholder”), to cancel an aggregate of
15,535,309
shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the Stockholder. The Reverse Acquisition was closed on May 17, 2021 (“Closing Date”).
For
accounting purpose, the transaction with KP International was treated as a reverse acquisition and KP International is deemed to be
the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will
be reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prior to the Reverse Acquisition will be those of KP
International and its consolidated subsidiaries and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of KP International, and the
accompanying consolidated financial statements after consummation of the Reverse Acquisition will include the assets and liabilities
of KP International and its subsidiaries and VIE, historical operations of KP International and its subsidiaries and VIE, and
operations of the Company from the Closing Date of the Reverse Acquisition. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements’ share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchanged shares in the Reverse
Acquisition. The equity structure of the Company was retrospectively adjusted under ASC Topic 805-40. As of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, there were
400,000,000
and
40,000,000
shares issued and outstanding, respectively.
Authorized
Shares and Name Change
Effective
as of September 9, 2021, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the Company’s authorized capital to
210,000,000
authorized shares of Capital Stock with
200,000,000
designated as $ 0.0001
par value common stock, and
10,000,000
designated as $ 0.0001
par value preferred stock.
Effective
October 12, 2022, we increased our authorized common stock from
200,000,000
shares, par value $ 0.0001 , to
1,000,000,000
shares, par value
$ 0.0001 , and on October 18, 2022, we effected a 10:1 forward stock split after which we have
400,000,000
shares of common stock issued
and outstanding.
On
November 8, 2022, the Company changed its name from CX Network Group, Inc. to Kun Peng International Ltd. and its trading symbol was
changed to “KPEA.”
On
November 11, 2022, the Company received an electronic notice that OTC Markets had approved its application for uplisting from OTC Pink
to the OTCQB Venture Market (OTCQB). The Company’s securities commenced trading on the OTCQB at the market open on November 14,
2022. The Company’s shares trade on the OTCQB under the current ticker symbol, “KPEA.”
Kun
Peng International Holding Limited
Kun
Peng International Holding Limited (“KP International Holding”) was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on April 20,
2021. On May 3, 2021, KP International Holding purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Kunpeng (China)
Industrial Development Company Limited (“KP Industrial”), incorporated in Hong Kong on August 11, 2017, at a cash
consideration of $ 0.129
(HK$ 1 ).
After the ownership transfer, KP International Holding became the sole shareholder of KP Industrial. KP International Holding is a
holding company.
Kunpeng
(China) Industrial Development Company Limited
Kunpeng
(China) Industrial Development Company Limited (“KP Industrial”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Hong
Kong under the name of Jing Jin Ji Investment Group Co., Limited (“Jing Jin Ji”) on August 11, 2017. The share capital
of KP Industrial is
10,000
ordinary shares at $ 1,292
(HKD 10,000 )
and was wholly owned by an individual. On November 9, 2018, Jing Jin Ji changed its name to “Kunpeng (China) Industrial
Development Company Limited” and it filed a Certificate of Change of Name with the Hong Kong Company Registry on the same day.
Although it was incorporated in 2017, it did not commence operations until July 2020 as it focused on exploring business
opportunities in its initial phase and on developing our online mobile application, King Eagle Mall, through its subsidiary, King
Eagle (China) Co., Ltd. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of KP International on May 3, 2021.
Kun
Peng (Hong Kong) Industrial Development Limited
Kun
Peng (Hong Kong) Industrial Development Limited (“KP (Hong Kong)”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Hong
Kong on June 21, 2021. It is a holding company and is wholly owned by Kun Peng International Holding Limited. The share capital of this
entity upon formation is $ 0.13
(HK$ 1 ).
King
Eagle (China) Co., Ltd.
King
Eagle (China) Co., Ltd. (“King Eagle (China)”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Beijing Economic Technological
Development Zone in the People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”) on March 20, 2019 with a registered capital of approximately
$ 15
million (RMB 100
million). King Eagle (China) was a wholly owned subsidiary of KP Industrial at the time of establishment. KP Industrial
transferred its approximately $ 2.2
million (RMB
15
million) or
15 % to Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd, a limited liability company incorporated
in Beijing, the PRC, on November 2, 2020.
8
On
March 26, 2021, Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd entered into equity transfer agreements with KP Industrial and Guoxin Zhengye. Both Guoxin
Ruilian Group Co., Ltd and Guoxin Zhengye are wholly owned by a common shareholder, Guoxin United Holdings Group Co., Ltd. Under the
agreements, Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd agreed to transfer its
8 % ownership in King Eagle (China) to Guoxin Zhengye and the
remaining
7 % ownership in King Eagle (China) to KP Industrial on April 20, 2021. After the transfer, KP Industrial and Guoxin Zhengye, respectively,
became the
92 % and
8 % shareholders of King Eagle (China). Guoxin Zhengye agreed to transfer its
8 % ownership interest in
King Eagle (China) to KP Industrial on August 26, 2022. As a result of the transfer, KP Industrial is the sole shareholder of King Eagle
(China).
Some of the business engaged in by King Eagle (Tianjin) is restricted or
prohibited for foreign investment under PRC regulations. Therefore, King Eagle (China) has entered into VIE Agreements with King Eagle
(Tianjin) and its shareholders. We do not own any equity interests in King Eagle (Tianjin), but control and receive the economic benefits
of its business operations through the VIE Agreements. The VIE Agreements enable us to provide King Eagle (Tianjin) with consulting services
on an exclusive basis in exchange for all of its annual profits, if any. In addition, we are able to appoint its senior executives and
approve all matters requiring approval of its shareholders. The VIE Agreements are comprised of a Consulting Service Agreement, Business
Operation Agreement, Proxy Agreement, Equity Disposal Agreement, and Equity Pledge Agreement.
Under
current Chinese laws and regulations, the Company believes that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders
of King Eagle (Tianjin) were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold KP International; such
SAFE registration was effected on May 14, 2021. These shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) will have to register their equity pledge
arrangement as required under the Equity Pledge Agreement with King Eagle (China). The Company faces uncertainty with respect to future
actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect King Eagle (Tianjin)’s financial performance and the enforceability
of the VIE Agreements.
King
Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd.
King
Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd. (“King Eagle (Tianjin)”) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Tianjin
Pilot Free Trade Zone in the People’s Republic of China on September 2, 2020, with a registered capital of approximately
$ 1.5
million (RMB
10
million). We do not own any of the equity of King Eagle (Tianjin). It is owned by multiple individuals: Chengyuan Li (approximately
45.5 %),
Xiujin Wang (approximately
10.5 %),
Yuanyuan Zhang (approximately
10 %),
Jinjing Zhang, Wanfeng Hu, Cuilian Liu, and Zhizhong Wang (each of whom owns approximately
6 %),
and Zhandong Fan and Hui Teng (each of whom owns approximately
5 %).
Those shareholders also indirectly owned KP International Holding prior to its acquisition by the Company through two British Virgin
Islands entities: Kunpeng Tech Limited and Kunpeng TJ Limited. Additionally, Chengyuan Li is a director and Yuanyuan Zhang is Chief
Financial Officer of the Company.

condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and its variable
interest entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances within the Company have been eliminated
upon consolidation.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions
The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that impact the presented amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the presented amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results
may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include the collectability
of receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets and intangibles, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets,
valuation of accruals for expenses and tax due.
Reclassification
Certain
amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the prior period net income, accumulated
deficit, net assets, or total shareholders’ deficit.
Going
Concern
The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America which contemplate continuation of the Company on a going concern basis. The going-concern basis assures that
assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial
statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern depends on the liquidation of its current assets and business
developments. In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its
operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements,
operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred cash
outflows from operating activities of $ 242,912 ,
a net loss of $ 760,313
and a
negative working capital of $ 5,086,513 .
Although the businesses and markets in mainland China have reopened as mainland China has relaxed its COVID-19 policies and
controls, cases of COVID-19 have increased significantly, particularly in the metropolitan areas,
which
may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities.
In addition, our online
sales during the first quarter of 2023 were slack, and there is a delay in the approval process for our permit for the construction
of Smart Kiosks due to the closure of government agencies in the affected areas in the PRC. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
10
The Company continues to monitor its operations
to help refine the Company’s financial liquidity. Options under consideration in the review process include, but are not limited
to, increasing sales through the Company’s online business ,
reducing
overhead costs, obtaining advances of funds from the Company’s stockholders and directors, or financing through the issuance of
shares. Since the first quarter of 2022, the Company has been focusing on increasing its revenue through its new online platform, Kun
Zhi Jian, to explore wholesale markets. This online platform focuses on promoting and selling our own brand of preventive health care
products to wholesalers. The Company also launched advertising campaigns to promote its own brand. The Company streamlined its administrative
overhead costs. For example, we reduced the compensation and benefits of our executives and decreased office supplies expense.
In
order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through its online
platforms and streamlining its overhead costs or obtaining
financing from its stockholders or directors. As we expect the COVID-19
pandemic and restrictive governmental controls in the PRC will be gradually softened, each of our service agents plans to launch three
marketing campaigns every week to promote our own brand products, particularly thermal therapy cabins. However, the Company cannot provide
any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its business plan, or that financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the group by providing
adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.
COVID-19
Outbreak
Businesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China
relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. However, a number of major metropolitan areas in the PRC,
such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Dalian, and Guiyang, experienced a COVID-19 resurgence, which caused restrictions on our
service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. Shortage of logistics and delivery capacity in those affected communities
precluded our customers from placing orders online. Due to closures and access restriction in certain affected areas and government agencies,
the approval process of our applications for the construction of Smart Kiosks was postponed, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face
customer services and increasing our market share.
The
Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care
and health related household products on its new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022,
to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications
for construction permits for Smart Kiosks.
While
we do not expect that the virus will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time, it
is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the
severity of the situation with COVID-19 in the PRC. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate
its potential exposure.
Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
attributable to the holders of our common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the holders of our common stock, as adjusted
for the effect of dilutive common stock equivalents, if any, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common
stock equivalents outstanding during the period. However, common stock equivalents are not included in the denominator of the diluted
earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.
11
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Our entity in the British Virgin Islands uses the U.S. dollar. Our entities in
the PRC and Hong Kong use the local currencies, Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), as their respective functional currencies
as determined based on the criteria of ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Translation.”
Assets
and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Income and expense accounts are translated at the
average translation rates and equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments resulting from this process
are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange
rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations
as incurred.
Translation
adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to $ 140,757
and $ 279,367 ,
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and a certain amount of cash kept in electronic wallets, “e-wallets.”
We consider all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain accounts with various financial institutions
in the PRC and in e-wallets. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, cash balances held in PRC banks are uninsured. Monies that
are held in e-wallets are deemed equivalent to cash, are highly liquid, and are relatively unsafe compared to cash in banks .
We have not experienced any losses in bank accounts or e-wallets and believe we are not exposed to significant
risks with respect to our cash in bank accounts and low risk with respect to our cash kept in e-wallets.
Financial
Instrument
The
carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash, other receivables, accrued liabilities and other payables approximate fair value
because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Gains and losses on dispositions of property and
equipment are included in operating income (loss). Major additions, renewals, and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and
repairs are recognized as expense as incurred.
Depreciation

Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements,”, for fair value measurements of financial
assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted
to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
ASC
820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy are as follows:
●
Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
●
Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.
The
Company’s financial assets and liabilities include cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.
Related
Party Transactions
The
Company follows the ASC 850-10, “Related Party Disclosures” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related
party transactions.
Pursuant
to section 850-10-20, related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities
would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825–10–15,
to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and income-sharing
trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company;
f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and
g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership
interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
13
The
condensed consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation
arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that
are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures
shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no
amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented; and c) such other information
deemed necessary to an understanding of the nature of the related party transactions.
Comprehensive
(Loss) Income
Other
comprehensive (loss) income refers to revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included
in comprehensive income but are excluded from net (loss) income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’
equity. Our other comprehensive (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is comprised of sales of goods and represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of goods. Revenue
was recorded on a gross basis, net of surcharges and value added tax (“VAT”) of gross sales. The Company recorded revenue
on a gross basis because the Company is the primary obligor of the sales arrangements, has latitude in establishing prices, has discretion
in suppliers’ selection, and assumes credit risks on receivables on gross sales from customers.
The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU
2014-09”) using the full retrospective transition method. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact
on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in its consolidated financial statements.
The
Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its
obligations under each of its agreements:
●
identify the contract with a customer;
●
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
●
determine the transaction price;
●
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
●
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Consistent
with the criteria of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” we recognize revenue when performance obligations are
satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point
in time, we also consider the following indicators to assess whether control of a promised good or service is transferred to the customer:
(i) right to payment; (ii) legal title; (iii) physical possession; (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership; and (v) acceptance
of the good or service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward
complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.
14
We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred
to customers of King Eagle Mall and our new online platform. Revenue is measured at the transaction price, which is based on the amount
of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods to our customers. The revenue mainly includes
two customer types: retail (“King Eagle Mall” online platform) and wholesale (“Kun Zhi Jian,” our new online platform).
The revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers.
Deferred
Revenue
Deferred
revenue results from transactions where the Company has received the payments from the customers but revenue recognition criteria under
the five-step model of ASC Topic 606 have yet to be met. Once all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied, the revenues will
be recognized upon the transfer of risk and rewards to the customers in the consolidated statement of operations. We anticipated the
majority of the revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year 2023. Management agreed that the amount received is non-refundable; however,
this term is not bound by any agreement. Thus, customers may have the right to challenge and demand the advances to be refunded
under relevant Commercial Laws or regulations.
Accrued
Product Liability
The Company records accruals for product liability when deemed probable
and estimable based on facts and circumstances and prior claims experience. Accruals for product credit are valued based upon the Company’s
prior claims experience, including defective goods and goods lost in transit. As we have experienced insignificant amounts of goods returned
and claims from goods lost in transit in the past, our product liability is insignificant; therefore, management believes product liability
accrual as at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 is negligible.
Discount
allowed - Accrued Store-Credit
We provide store-credit, “Golden Beans,” to our customers after
sales of goods to them. The Golden Beans can be utilized against their future purchases with restrictions and expiry date. The amount
utilized will be recognized as direct discount as and when the sales arise, and the price net of this discount has been controlled and
set by management to ensure that the sales will always result in a gross profit. As such, we do not accrue any liability from this store-credit
as there is no present obligation arising from Golden Beans as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, and the utilization of these
Golden Beans is not expected to result in an outflow from the Company’s resources embodying economic benefits.
Lease
Under
ASC Topic 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present
value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future
lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The
Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable lease term in calculating the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
The
Company may recognize the lease payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operation on a straight-line basis over the lease
terms and variable lease payments in the periods in which the obligations for those payments are incurred, if any. The lease payments
under the lease arrangements are fixed.
The
Company elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company to carry-forward its historical lease classification, its
assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and its initial direct costs for any lease that exists prior to adoption of
the new standard.
The
Company also elected to apply the short-term lease exception for lease arrangements with a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement.
Lease terms used to compute the present value of lease payments do not include any option to extend, renew, or terminate the lease that
the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise upon the lease inception. Accordingly, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities
do not include leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
15
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development (R&D) expenses are all costs associated with the original development and design of the product as well as any intellectual
property (IP) generated during the development phase, including patents and copyrights. Research and development expenses are included
in the overall operating expenses and reflected as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations.
We purchase the consumer preventive health food and health related household
products sold on our platforms from our suppliers and we did not develop, design, or manufacture those products. Moreover, although we
have built our online platform and mobile commerce in-house, the compensation costs for our in-house technology team were not significant.
Accordingly, instead of capitalizing the compensation costs of our in-house technology team as research and development on the Balance
Sheet or presenting them as research and development expenses, we included these amounts in employee compensation and benefit expenses
within general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Selling
Expenses
Selling expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional service
fees to service agents and other costs incurred by our sales and marketing department, such as staff costs, office supplies, and other
incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers.
Our
selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 728,792
and $ 3,265,453 , respectively. We
recognized the marketing and promotional service expense when our service agents performed marketing activities, promotions, and
exhibitions for our business and products. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded marketing and
promotional service fees to our service agents in an amount of $ 546,660
and $ 3,020,635 ,
respectively.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards
Income
Taxes . In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic
740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which modifies and eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of
ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” This standard was effective for KPIL after September 30, 2021. The Company evaluated that this new
guidance does not have a significant impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Financial
Instruments . In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,”Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
(Topic 326)” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial
instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. Originally, ASU 2016-13 was effective for fiscal years, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, FASB issued
ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic
842).” This ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for public companies that are considered smaller reporting companies
as defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and evaluated that this new guidance does not have a significant
impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
the period from December 2022 through January 2023, the FASB has not issued additional accounting standards updates.

17
A
VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such
as through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of
the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary
and must consolidate the VIE. King Eagle (China) is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary of
King Eagle (Tianjin) because it has both of the following characteristics:
(1)
The
power to direct activities at King Eagle (Tianjin) that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance, and
(2)
The
obligation to absorb losses of, and the right to receive benefits from, King Eagle (Tianjin) that could potentially be significant
to such entity.
Pursuant
to the Contractual Arrangements, King Eagle (Tianjin) pays service fees equal to all of its net profit after tax payments to King Eagle
(China). At the same time, to King Eagle (China) is obligated to absorb all of their losses. The Contractual Arrangements are designed
so that King Eagle (Tianjin) operates to the benefit of King Eagle (China) and ultimately the Company.
Based on the foregoing VIE Agreements,
King Eagle (China) has effective 100% full control of King Eagle (Tianjin), which enables King Eagle (China) to receive all of King Eagle
(Tianjin)’s expected residual returns and absorb its expected losses. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the accounts of King
Eagle (Tianjin) and its subsidiaries for the periods presented herein, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 810-10,
“Consolidation.”
Accordingly, the accounts of King Eagle (Tianjin) are consolidated in the
accompanying financial statements pursuant to ASC 810-10, “Consolidation.” In addition, the financial positions and results
of operations of the Company’s subsidiaries are included in the Company’s financial statements.
The
Company consolidated its VIE as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The carrying amounts and classification of the VIE’s
assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

On March 31, 2021, King Eagle (Tianjin) entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd., which, at that time, was our related party. Guoxin
Star Network Co. Ltd. was formerly our related party due to its being wholly owned by Guoxin Rulian Group Co. Ltd., which also owns Guoxin
Zhengye. Guoxin Zhengye was the
8 % shareholder of King Eagle (China) but transferred its entire ownership interest in King Eagle (China)
to KP Industrial on August 26, 2022.
Under
the Cooperation Agreement, King Eagle (Tianjin) is required to pay Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd. approximately $ 1.1
million
(RMB
7.5
million) for the franchise of the operation of Smart Kiosks. Both parties are entitled to exercise the Force Majeure Clause
of the contract. In April 2021, King Eagle (Tianjin) remitted $ 0.33
million (RMB 2,250,000 ) to Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd. The remaining obligation,
approximately $ 0.74
million (RMB 5.3

EQUITY
Effective
as of September 9, 2021, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the Company’s authorized capital
to
210,000,000
authorized shares of capital stock with
200,000,000
designated as $ 0.0001
par value common stock, and
10,000,000
designated
as $ 0.0001
par value preferred stock.
Effective
on October 12, 2022, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized number of shares
of the Company’s $ 0.0001
par value common stock from
200,000,000
shares to
1,000,000,000
shares
of common stock.
The
Company’s board of directors approved and declared a 10:1 forward split of its common stock on September 6, 2022. As a result
of the stock split, holders of pre-split shares of common stock have the right to receive post-split shares of common stock at a
ratio of ten (10) shares of post-split common stock for every one (1) share of pre-split common stock. The stock split had a record
date of September 16, 2022 and an effective date of October 18, 2022. No fractional shares are issuable as a result of the forward
stock split. After the forward stock split, there are
400,000,000
shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding. The par value per share remained unchanged at $ 0.0001
per share after the forward stock split.
Preferred
stock
The
Company’s authorized shares of preferred stock are
10,000,000
shares, with a par value of $ 0.0001
per share ,
which may be issued in series and with such voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative rights
as the board of directors shall determine in its sole discretion.
No
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Common
stock
With
the retrospective effect of the increase in authorized shares of common stock and 10:1 forward stock split, the Company’s authorized
shares of common stock were
1,000,000,000
and
1,000,000,000
shares with a par value of $ 0.0001 , as of December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, respectively. The issued and outstanding shares of common stock were
400,000,000
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30,
2022.
Reverse
acquisition
On
May 17, 2021, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Kun Peng
International Holding Limited (“KP International”), a limited liability company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands on April 20, 2021, and (ii) the five members of KP International to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of
KP International in exchange for the issuance to those members of an aggregate of
34,158,391
shares of our common stock (“Reverse Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, and as a
condition to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company also agreed to enter into
an agreement with Wenhai Xia (“the Stockholder”), to cancel an aggregate of
15,535,309
shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the Stockholder. The Reverse Acquisition was completed on May 17,
2021 (“Closing Date”).
For accounting purposes, the transaction with KP International was treated
as a reverse acquisition and KP International is deemed to be the acquirer with the Company as the acquired party. Consequently, the assets
and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prior to the
Reverse Acquisition will be those of KP International and its consolidated subsidiaries and will be recorded at the historical cost basis
of KP International, and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements after consummation of the reverse acquisition
will include the assets and liabilities of KP International and its subsidiaries and VIE, historical operations of KP International and
its subsidiaries and VIE, and operations of the Company from the Closing Date of the Reverse Acquisition. The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchanged shares in the
Reverse Acquisition. The equity structure of the Company was retrospectively adjusted under ASC Topic 805-40.
As
of December 31, 2022, there were
400,000,000
shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
22
Restricted
net assets :
Our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on us receiving distributions
of funds from our subsidiary or VIE. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends only out of a company’s
retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations and after it has met the PRC requirements
for appropriation to statutory reserves. Share capital of the PRC subsidiary and VIE included in the Company’s consolidated net
assets are also non-distributable for dividend purposes. The results of operations reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of King Eagle (China),
the foreign-invested enterprise, King Eagle (Tianjin), the VIE, and KP Tian Yu. The Company is required to set aside at least 10% of its
after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital.
In addition, the Company may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund
and staff bonus and welfare fund at its discretion. The statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash
dividends.
As
a result of the foregoing restrictions, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin), and KP Tian Yu are restricted in their ability to
transfer their net assets to the Company. Foreign exchange and other regulation in the PRC may further restrict these entities from
transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans, and advances. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the
Company had negative net assets, which included common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated deficit, and foreign exchange
translation adjustment of its subsidiaries in BVI, Hong Kong, and the PRC and of the VIE that are included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin), KP Tian Yu, and King Eagle
(Bejing) incurred negative net assets which amounted to $ 1,263,636 ,
$ 2,720,149 ,
$ 384,
and $ nil ,
respectively. As of September 30, 2022, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin), and KP Tian Yu had incurred negative assets in an
amount of $ 844,025 ,
$ 2,311,792,
and $ 351 ,
respectively. Accordingly, the Company did not accrue statutory reserve funds as of December 31, 2022 and September 30,
2022.

INCOME TAXES
The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the accounting standards that require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the
expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the accounting standards require
the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. The Company and its subsidiaries
file separate income tax returns.
United
States
Kun
Peng International Ltd is incorporated in the State of Nevada and is subject to United States federal income tax. No provision for
income taxes in the U.S. has been made as the Company has no U.S. taxable income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
British
Virgin Islands
KP
International is a holding company organized as an International Business Company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”),
and its principal operating subsidiaries are organized under the laws of Hong Kong and the laws of the PRC. KP International and its
subsidiaries are not subject to income taxes in the BVI.
Hong
Kong
The
two-tier profits tax rates system was introduced under the Inland Revenue (Amendment)(No.3) Ordinance 2018 (“the
Ordinance”) of Hong Kong and became effective for the assessment year 2018/2019. Under the two-tier profit tax rates regime,
the profits tax rate for the first $ 0.26
million (HKD
2
million) of assessable profits of a corporation will be subject to the lowered tax rate,
8.25 %,
while the remaining assessable profits will be subject to the legacy tax rate,
16.5 %.
Pursuant to the Ordinance, only one entity within a group of “connected entities” is eligible for the two-tier tax rate
benefit. An entity is a connected entity of another entity if (1) one entity has control over the other; (2) both entities are under
the control (more than 50% of the issued share capital) of the same entity; or (3) in the case of the first entity being a natural
person carrying on a sole proprietorship business, the other entity is the same person carrying on another sole proprietorship
business.
Since KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) are wholly owned and under the control
of KP International, these entities are connected entities. Under the Ordinance, it is an entity’s election to nominate the entity
that will utilize the two-tier profits tax rates on its profits tax return. The election is irrevocable. The Company elected KP (Hong
Kong) to utilize the two-tier profits tax rates. KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and, therefore, KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) were not subject to Hong Kong profits
tax for the periods reported.
Since
the two-tier profit tax rates regime is tentative, we applied the original profits tax rate,
16.5 %, for the calculation of deferred taxes
for our subsidiaries in Hong Kong.
PRC
The
PRC’s statutory income tax rate is
25 %.
The Company’s subsidiary and VIE registered in the PRC are subject to income tax rate of
25 %,

Uncertain
tax positions
The
Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business,
the Company is subject to examination by the respective jurisdictions, where applicable. The statute of limitations for the tax returns
varies by jurisdiction.
The statute of limitations for
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to assess the income tax returns of a taxpayer expires three years from the due date of the income tax
return or the date on which it was filed, whichever is later.
In accordance with the Hong Kong
profits tax regulations, a tax assessment by the IRD may be initiated within six years after the relevant year of assessment, but that
period is extendable to 10 years in the case of potential willful underpayment or evasion.
In accordance with the PRC Tax Administration Law on the Levying and Collection
of Taxes, the PRC tax authorities generally have up to five years to assess underpaid tax plus penalties and interest for PRC entities’
tax filings. In the case of tax evasion, which is not clearly defined in the law, there is no limitation on the tax years open for investigation.
Accordingly, the PRC entities remain subject to examination by the tax authorities based on the above.
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not accrue any liability, interest, or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions in the provision for income taxes in its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that its assessment
regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change over the next 12 months.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
of the Business
Due
to global health issues and the pandemic, people have increased their health and nutrition consciousness. We believe preventive care
is the most effective investment in health.
To
promote awareness of preventive care among the people in the PRC, we have developed and launched our mobile platform (King Eagle Mall).
With cooperation from Guoxin Star Nework Co. Ltd. (“Guoxin Star”), we also started planning the development of physical (Smart
Kiosk) platforms. Guoxin Star was formerly our related party due to its being wholly owned by Guoxin Ruilian which also owns Guoxin Zhengye.
Guoxin Zhengye was the 8% shareholder of King Eagle (China) but transferred its entire ownership interest in King Eagle (China) to KP
Industrial on August 26, 2022.
King
Eagle Mall
King Eagle Mall is a mobile social e-commerce platform that was launched
in July 2020 and that promotes preventive health care products and services as our core business. It adopts the S2B2C business model and
integrates many major health care products and services. We focus on health-related products and services. King Eagle Mall is designed
to enable health-related products to be sold by us and by third parties. King Eagle Mall’s products are divided into two sectors:
self-operated products and selected products, which promote preventive health care. Our team screens and examines products that are and
will be offered both by us and by affiliated merchants. Our major products include health care products, such as dietary supplements,
nutritional health foods, and beauty cosmeceuticals, and other categories (for instance, milk powder, dried fruits) of health foods for
supporting the cardiovascular system and bone joint health. We offer collagen peptides, probiotics, and health foods for improving blood
circulation and vein health, as well as household products which can promote and improve a healthier lifestyle for our members. We receive
customer orders and may arrange fulfillment with our merchants who are responsible for delivery arrangements or fulfill customer orders
through our outsourced networks.
As
of early February 2023, King Eagle Mall had approximately 9,530 members.
Kun
Zhi Jian (New Online Platform)
In
October 2022, King Eagle (Tianjin) introduced and implemented a new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, which focuses on promoting and selling
our own brand of preventive health care and health related household products to wholesalers. During the platform’s initial phase,
we also sell other well-known and high-quality health food products to enhance our reputation and market share. Beginning January 2023, the operation of our new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, was transferred to King Eagle (Beijing)
from King Eagle (Tianjin). This online platform
is operated at: http://api.kp-tj.com/roomapp/#/home.
Currently,
we focus on promoting and selling our own brand of thermal therapy cabins to wholesalers. Equipped with infrared lights and at high temperatures
similar to those of a hot spring, we believe this product helps enhance blood circulation and oxygen inhalation and improves insomnia.
In addition to the thermal therapy cabins, we focus on promoting and selling our own brand of health food products on this new platform.
As of February 2023, our new online platform had approximately 212 wholesaler members.
Smart
Kiosk
With
support and cooperation from Guoxim Star, we introduced the Smart Kiosk concept. The Smart Kiosk functions as a physical customer service
center and as community marketing for attracting customers, providing customer service, promoting our 500+ preventive health care and
health related household products, and introducing concepts of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 5G Internet connection is also available for
our customers to connect to our online application, King Eagle Mall, so that our customers can access King Eagle Mall and place orders
for our products.
The
construction of Smart Kiosks will be initiated and originally administered by Guoxin Star. However, since 2021, the central and local
governments of the PRC have imposed COVID-19 quarantines and closures in certain affected areas. Thus, the approval process for our applications
for construction permits of Smart Kiosks has been delayed by the local governmental agencies. Although mainland China relaxed its COVID-19
policies and controls in early December 2022, the number of cases of COVID-19 has increased tremendously. Currently, we estimate initiation
of the approval process at the local government agencies will be approximately the second half of 2023.
28
COVID-19
Update
Businesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China
relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. However, a number of major metropolitan areas in the PRC,
such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Dalian, and Guiyang, have experienced a COVID-19 resurgence. This has resulted in restrictions
on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. Shortage of logistics and delivery capacity in those affected
communities has preluded our customers from placing orders online. Due to closures and access restrictions imposed by government agencies
in certain affected areas, the approval process for our applications for the construction of Smart Kiosks has been postponed, which impacts
our plans for enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share.
The
Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care
and health related household products on its new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022,
to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also closely monitors the local governmental agencies regarding its applications
for construction permits for Smart Kiosks.
While
we do not expect that the COVID-19 virus will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this
time, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequences of the recurrence of COVID-19 variants on our future business performance
and liquidity due to the current severity of outbreaks of COVID-19 in the PRC. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving
situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.
Recent
Regulatory Developments in China
Under
current Chinese laws and regulations, the Company believes that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders
of King Eagle (Tianjin) were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold KP International, and such
SAFE registration was implemented on May 14, 2021. The shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) will have to register their equity pledge
arrangement as required under the Equity Pledge Agreement with King Eagle (China). The Company faces uncertainty with respect to future
actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect King Eagle (Tianjin)’s financial performance and the enforceability
of the VIE Agreements.
On
July 6, 2021, the PRC government issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, calling for: (i) tightening
oversight of data security, cross-border data flow, and administration of classified information, as well as amendments to relevant regulation
to specify responsibilities of overseas listed Chinese companies with respect to data security and information security; (ii) enhanced
oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies; and (iii) extraterritorial
application of China’s securities laws. As the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities were recently
issued, there are great uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation thereof. We will closely monitor further
developments.
In addition, on July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the
“CA”) issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), or the Measures, for public comment, which
proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may
affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million
users. The CA is currently soliciting comments and the Measures are subject to change. As we have fewer than one million users, we believe
that the Measures will not be applicable to us if they take effect in current form. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data
security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies, and
prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period. There are great uncertainties regarding the interpretation
and enforcement of PRC laws, rules, and regulations regarding data and privacy security. We may be required to change our data and other
business practices and be subject to regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in issuer growth
or engagement as a result of these laws and policies. Further, our consulting business with respect to overseas listing and capital raising
may be adversely affected.

Total
$ 452,118
$ 4,669,408
Our
retail revenue primarily included the sale of health care and health related household products to our retail customers via our mobile
application, King Eagle Mall, which was launched in July 2020. Our wholesale revenue came from our new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian,
which was launched in October 2022. This new online platform focuses on promoting and selling our own brand of preventive health care
related products, such as the thermal therapy cabin, to our wholesalers. We recognize our revenue on a gross basis, net of sub-charges
and value-added tax (“VAT”) of gross sales.
Compared
to the three months ended December 31, 2021, we generated substantially lower revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Our retail revenue from King Eagle Mall during the three months ended December 31, 2022 plummeted by 99% compared to the same period
in 2021. Due to the COVID-19 resurgence and significant rise of COVID-19 cases after the reopening in December 2022, the shortage of
logistics and delivery capacity in the affected communities and the slowdown of economic development in the PRC, we lowered the retail
price of our products. Accordingly, our retail revenue from King Eagle Mall decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Our new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, was launched in October 2022. Accordingly, we did not incur wholesale revenue during the three
months ended December 31, 2021.
30
Cost
of revenue
Our
cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $109,188 and $709,209, respectively. This primarily included
the purchase of health care and health related household products from our suppliers. We disaggregated our cost of revenue by customer
type, retail and wholesale, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

$ 709,209
We
incurred a lower cost of revenue related to our retail revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period
in 2021 because we generated lower retail revenue volume and amount from King Eagle Mall during the three months ended December 31, 2022
as discussed above. Since our new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, was launched in October 2022, we did not incur cost of goods sold related
to our wholesale revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Gross
profit
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the gross profit and margin for our retail business of King Eagle Mall amounted to
$12,522 or 59.4% and $3,960,199 or 84.8%, respectively. Our gross profit or margin for our retail business of King Eagle Mall for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 was substantially lower than that for the same period in 2021. As previously discussed, our retail
revenue amount decreased in the current period as we reduced the retail price for our products.
The
gross profit and margin for our wholesale business of Kun Zhi Jian for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $330,408
or 76.7% and $nil or 0%, respectively. Our new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, was launched in October 2022 and accordingly, we did not
incur revenue and cost of revenue related to our wholesale revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Operating
expenses
Our
operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses and selling expense. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, our total operating expenses were $1,103,616 and $3,647,354, respectively. We experienced a reduced amount of operating expenses
in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to the lower selling expense.
General
and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 were $374,824 and $381,901, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the decrease in general and
administrative expenses of $7,077 was chiefly triggered by lower employee compensation and benefits, which was offset by an increase in
professional service fees, transportation and gasoline, meals and entertainment, and depreciation. Our employee compensation and benefits
were reduced by $53,936 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Due to the economic downturn and the rise of COVID-19 cases in the
PRC, our administrative employee headcount was reduced by 9 from 33 employees for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 24 employees
for the same period in 2022. As our retail business slowed, we decreased our employee headcount to improve our liquidity.
31
The
decline in employee compensation and benefits was offset by an increase in each of following categories:
●
professional
service fees by $27,705. We incurred additional professional fees for exploring new business and setting up business events;
●
transportation
and gasoline by $9,232. Based on the limited ground and air transportation services available in the PRC due to COVID-19, our senior
management traveled by automobile to various major cities and communities to promote our brand and health care products. We also
incurred additional repair and maintenance services for our automobile due to higher mileage;
●
meals
and entertainment by $2,864. Our senior management incurred meal and hotel accommodation expenses during business travels to
various cities and communities; and
●
depreciation
and amortization by $6,466. Our depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was comparatively higher as we
incurred leasehold improvement expenditures for our new office location in August 2022.
Our
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were comprised of the following:

Selling
expense
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our selling expense,
which was primarily incurred by our sales and marketing department, was $728,792 and $3,265,453, respectively. Compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2021, our selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $2,536,661. The decrease was primarily
based on the decrease in service agent fees by $2,473,975 as marketing and promotional service fees to our service agents declined significantly
due to the rise in COVID-19 cases and intermittent lockdowns in certain local areas. Our employee compensation and benefit expense decreased
by $92,976 as we reduced the headcount in our sales and marketing department by six employees in the three months ended December 31, 2022,
from eight employees in the three months ended December 31, 2021 to two employees in the same period in 2022. To further streamline our
selling costs, we no longer engaged external customer support services in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our total selling
expense was offset by an increase in:
●
meal
and entertainment by $38,060, which were incurred by our sales and marketing team launching small scale promotions and marketing
activities; and
●
advertising
by $26,301 as we engaged a multi-media company to assist us with promotions of our Company and business operations on China Fortune
Network, an online platform providing professional investment and financial information to the local people in the PRC.

Other
income
Other income primarily included bank interest income, foreign exchange
gain or loss, and other service income. Our other income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $373 and $25,013, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred an additional source of income in the amount of $23,453 relating to online
technical support services provided to a corporate customer for our lutein supplement products. However, such service was not requested
for 2022 by this corporate customer due to the economic slowdown and low sales volume of the lutein supplement products. Compared to the
interest income of $1,560 earned in the three months ended December 31, 2021, our interest income in the same period in 2022 was $49 due
to a significantly lower average monthly cash balance in our bank accounts as a result of lower revenue.
Income
tax expense
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our income tax expense
was nil. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we generated a net loss before income tax and recognized a full valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets, which included net operating loss carry-forwards. Management believes it is more likely than not that
we will not recognize our net operating loss carry-forwards in the near future or before expiration. During the three months ended December
31, 2021, King Eagle (Tianjin) incurred book income before income tax and taxable income and utilized the net operating loss carry-forwards
to offset its entire taxable income. On the other hand, KPIL, the subsidiaries in Hong Kong, and King Eagle (China) incurred book loss
and tax loss. Therefore, we recognized a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these entities as we believe it is
more likely than not that these entities will not recognize their respective deferred tax assets in the near future.
Net
income (loss)
As a result of the factors discussed above, we posted a net loss in the
amount of $760,313 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income in the amount of $337,858 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021.
Foreign
currency translation adjustment
The functional currency for our operations in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan
or Renminbi (“RMB”); the functional currency for our operations in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar (“HKD”).
The financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using the period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities; equity is translated
at historical exchange rates; and average rates of exchange (for the period) are used for revenues and expenses and cash flows. Transaction
gains and/or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
are included in the results of operations as incurred. As a result of foreign currency translation, which is a noncash adjustment, we
reported a foreign currency translation (loss) of $(138,610) and a gain of $13,004 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Comprehensive
income (loss)
We
recognized a comprehensive loss of $898,923 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to comprehensive income of $350,862
for the same period in 2021.
33
Liquidity
and capital resources
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had cash and a cash equivalents balance of $25,320 and $267,131, respectively.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities totaled $242,912. Operating cash outflow was mainly attributable
to the net loss, $760,313, payments for payroll payable, $5,728, payments to lessors, $19,224 , and payments to third-party vendors, $7,467. The overall cash outflow was offset
by an increase in trade and other payable, $534,327, and amount due to related parties, $16,310.
Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $509, which was primarily related to the acquisition of trademarks.
There
was no financing activity for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Effect
of exchange rate change on cash totaled $1,610. The resulting change in cash for the period was a decrease of $241,811.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $679,690. Operating cash inflow was
mainly attributable to net income, $337,858, a decrease in prepayments to vendors, $103,754, an increase in amount due to related
parties, $741,889, and an increase in trade creditors, $361,576, which was offset by payments made to third-party vendors, $727,698,
an increase in advance to our employees, $30,413, a decrease in customers’ prepayment, $78,588, an increase in payroll
payments, $13,936, and an increase in indirect tax payments, $24,284.
Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $7,459, which was primarily related to the purchase of office and computer equipment.
There
was no financing activity for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Effect
of exchange rate change on cash totaled $(44,568). The resulting change in cash for the period was an increase of $627,663.
The
following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022:

We require cash of approximately $2.5 million within the next twelve months,
primarily related to third-party vendor payables. As of December 31, 2022, we received customer advances in the amount of approximately
$2.9 million. We anticipated the majority of our revenue will be recognized in fiscal year 2023. Management agreed that the amount received
is non-refundable. However, this term is not binding by any contractual agreement. Thus, the customers may have the right to challenge
and demand the advances be refunded under relevant Commercial Laws or regulations. Additionally, we had approximately $0.76 million commitment
related to purchase and service agreements and the cooperation agreement for Smart Kiosks as of December 31, 2022.
34
In an effort to support and maintain our financial position and operations,
to fulfill our contractual commitments, and to meet the demands from our customers for refund of their advanced payments, we will continue
to focus on increasing our revenue through our online platforms. In October 2022, we introduced and implemented our second online platform,
Kun Zhi Jian, which focuses on promoting and selling our own brand of health care related products, particularly the thermal therapy cabin,
to wholesalers and retailers. We will continue to engage service agents to promote our products and reduce our administrative overhead
costs, such as the restructuring of our administrative department. Simultaneously, our directors and stakeholders continue to financially
support our operations. We believe that such measures will improve our liquidity during the next twelve months. If we are not able to
increase revenue or obtain any financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
Going
Concern Consideration
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of
the Company on a going concern basis. The going concern basis assures that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the
ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
depends on the liquidation of its current assets and business developments. In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors
and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs
are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. For the three months ended December
31, 2022, the Company incurred cash outflows from operating activities of $242,912, a net loss of $760,313, and negative working capital
of $5,086,513. Although the businesses and markets in mainland China have reopened as mainland China has relaxed its COVID-19 policies
and controls, the number of cases of the COVID-19 increased significantly, particularly in metropolitan areas. Face-to-face marketing
activities of our service agents were restrained. Logistics and delivery capacity in those affected communities were limited. We also
lowered the retail price of our retail products on King Eagle Mall to retain our current customers and attract more sales turnover. As
a result, our online sales during the first quarter of 2023 were slack. Moreover, there was a delay in the approval process for the permit
for the construction of Smart Kiosks due to the closure of government agencies in the affected areas in the PRC. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
The Company continues to monitor its operations to help refine the Company’s
financial liquidity. Options under consideration in the review process include, but are not limited to, reduction of overhead costs, fund
advance from the Company’s stockholders and directors, or financing through the issuance of shares. Since the first quarter of 2022,
the Company has been focusing on increasing its revenue through its new online platform, Kun Zhi Jian, to explore the wholesale market.
This online platform focuses on promoting and selling our own brand of preventive health care products to wholesalers. The Company also
launched marketing campaigns to promote its own brand, particularly thermal therapy cabins. The Company streamlined its administrative
overhead costs. For example, we reduced the compensation and benefits of our executives and decreased office supplies expense.
In order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company
continues to focus on increasing its revenue through its online platforms and streamlining its overhead costs or obtaining a financing
from its stockholders or directors. As we expect the COVID-19 pandemic in the PRC will be gradually softened, each of our service agents
plans to launch three marketing campaigns every week to promote our own brand of products, particularly thermal therapy cabins. However,
the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its
business plan, or that financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the
group by providing adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support, credit risk support, or other benefits.
35
Future
Financings
We
will continue to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity
securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities, or if we are able, there is no guarantee
that existing shareholders will not be substantially diluted.
Critical
Accounting Policies
We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to make budgetary and financial statement assumptions. A complete
summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on
historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

4. Controls and Procedures
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We
maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15I under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure
controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on his evaluation as of the end
of the quarter ended December 31, 2022, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer and principal accounting manager,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required
to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting due to the existence of the following material weaknesses:
●
A
lack of sufficient and adequately trained internal accounting and finance personnel with appropriated understanding of U.S. GAAP
and SEC reporting requirement;
●
A
lack of segregation of duties within significant accounts;
●
A
lack of a functioning audit committee and a majority of outside directors on the Company’s board of director.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures
were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies
that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls
and that are considered to be material weaknesses as described herein above. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the company’s annual or quarterly financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the financial
statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going
basis. We are currently hiring additional personnel in financial reporting and accounting, and we are providing trainings to newly hired
personnel. In addition, once our cash position improves, we plan to hire an experienced controller and work to build an internal accounting
team with sufficient in-house expertise in US GAAP reporting. However, due to the limited cash flow we are currently having, we cannot
assure you when we will be able to implement those remediation methods.
Because
we are a smaller reporting company, this report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
(b)
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 covered by this report that has materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than the facts disclosed above.
