FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that relate to our plans, objectives, estimates, and goals.
Statements expressing expectations regarding our future, or projections or estimates relating to products, sales, revenues, expenditures, costs, strategies, initiatives, or earnings, are typical of such statements and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions and expectations about our future performance, considering the information currently available to management.
The words “believe,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “seek,” “strive,” and words of similar import, or the negative of such words, identify or signal the presence of forward-looking statements.
These statements are not statements of historical fact; they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or financial condition to differ materially from the expectations of future results, performance, or financial condition that we express or imply in any forward-looking statement.
Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
• the competitive nature of the textile industry and the impact of global competition;
• changes in the trade regulatory environment and governmental policies and legislation;
• the availability, sourcing, and pricing of raw materials;
• general domestic and international economic and industry conditions in markets where the Company competes, including economic and political factors over which the Company has no control;
• changes in consumer spending, customer preferences, fashion trends, and end uses for the Company’s products;
• the financial condition of the Company’s customers;
• the loss of a significant customer or brand partner;
• natural disasters, industrial accidents, power, or water shortages, extreme weather conditions and other disruptions at one of the Company’s facilities;
• the disruption of operations, global demand, or financial performance as a result of catastrophic or extraordinary events, including epidemics or pandemics such as strains of coronavirus (“COVID-19”);
• the success of the Company’s strategic business initiatives;
• the volatility of financial and credit markets;
• the ability to service indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and strategic business initiatives;
• the availability of and access to credit on reasonable terms;
• changes in foreign currency exchange, interest, and inflation rates;
• fluctuations in production costs;
• the ability to protect intellectual property;
• the strength and reputation of the Company’s brands;
• employee relations;
• the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees;
• the impact of climate change or environmental, health, and safety regulations;
• the impact of tax laws, the judicial or administrative interpretations of tax laws, and/or changes in such laws or interpretations; and
• other factors discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2022 or in the Company’s other periodic reports and information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
All such factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and may be beyond our control.
New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor on the Company.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made, except as may be required by federal securities laws.
In light of all the above considerations, we reiterate that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution you not to rely on them as such.

Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1.
Background Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969 (together with its subsidiaries, “UNIFI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a multinational company that manufactures and sells innovative recycled and synthetic products, made from polyester and nylon, primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers (UNIFI’s “direct customers”) that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial, and other end-use markets (UNIFI’s “indirect customers”).
We sometimes refer to these indirect customers as “brand partners.” Polyester products include partially oriented yarn (“POY”), textured, solution and package dyed, twisted, beamed, and draw wound yarns, and each is available in virgin or recycled varieties. Recycled solutions, made from both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste, include plastic bottle flake (“Flake”), polyester polymer beads (“Chip”), and staple fiber.
Nylon products include virgin or recycled textured, solution dyed, and spandex covered yarns. UNIFI maintains one of the textile industry’s most comprehensive product offerings that include a range of specialized, value-added and commodity solutions, with principal geographic markets in North America, Central America, South America, Asia, and Europe. UNIFI has direct manufacturing operations in
four
countries and participates in joint ventures with operations in Israel and the United States (“U.S.”).
2.
Basis of Presentation; Condensed Notes The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. As contemplated by the instructions of the SEC to Form 10-Q, the following notes have been condensed and, therefore, do not contain all disclosures required in connection with annual financial statements.
Reference should be made to UNIFI’s year-end audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). The financial information included in this report has been prepared by UNIFI, without audit.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal, recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods have been included.
Nevertheless, the results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and certain financial statement disclosures.
Actual results may vary from these estimates. All amounts, except per share amounts, are presented in thousands (000s), except as otherwise noted. The fiscal quarter for each of Unifi, Inc., its primary domestic operating subsidiaries and its subsidiary in El Salvador ended on January 1, 2023. Unifi, Inc.’s remaining material operating subsidiaries’ fiscal quarter ended on December 31, 2022. There were no significant transactions or events that occurred between Unifi, Inc.’s fiscal quarter end and such wholly owned subsidiaries’ fiscal quarter end. The three-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021 both consisted of 13 weeks.
The six-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021 both consisted of 26 weeks.
3.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Based on UNIFI’s review of Accounting Standards Updates issued since the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K, there have been no newly issued or newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on UNIFI’s consolidated financial statements.

Third-Party Manufacturer Third-party manufacturer revenue is primarily generated through sales to direct customers. Such sales represent satisfaction of UNIFI’s performance obligations required by the associated revenue contracts. Each of UNIFI’s reportable segments derives revenue from sales to third-party manufacturers. Service Revenue Service revenue is primarily generated, as services are rendered, through fulfillment of toll manufacturing of textile products or transportation services governed by written agreements. Such toll manufacturing and transportation services represent satisfaction of UNIFI’s performance obligations required by the associated revenue contracts.
REPREVE Fiber REPREVE Fiber represents UNIFI's collection of fiber products on our recycled platform, with or without added technologies. Variable Consideration
For all variable consideration, where appropriate, UNIFI estimates the amount using the expected value method, which takes into consideration historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect UNIFI’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which the customer is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Variable consideration has been immaterial to UNIFI’s financial statements for all periods presented.

ABL Facility Unifi, Inc. entered into the Sixth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) on September 2, 2022. The Sixth Amendment modified the Trigger Level of the Prior Credit Agreement, which relates to, among other things, the requirement to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio such that it occurs when Excess Availability falls below (a) for the period beginning on September 2, 2022 through and including the date that is
60
days after such date, $ 16,500
and (b) at all other times, the greatest of (i) $ 10,000 , (ii)

Unifi, Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited)   On October 28, 2022, Unifi, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a $ 230,000
senior secured credit facility (the “2022 ABL Facility”), including a $ 115,000
revolving credit facility and a term loan ("2022 ABL Term Loan") that can be reset up to a maximum amount of $ 115,000 , once per fiscal year, if certain conditions are met. The 2022 ABL Facility has a maturity date of
October 28, 2027 . The 2022 ABL Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $ 2,300
commencing on February 1, 2023.
Borrowings under the
2022 ABL Facility bear interest at SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin of
1.25 % to
1.75 %, or the Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of
0.25 % to
0.75 %, with interest paid on a monthly basis. Prior to entering the 2022 Credit Agreement, Unifi, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries maintained the Prior Credit Agreement that established a $ 200,000
senior secured credit facility (the “Prior ABL Facility”), including a $ 100,000
revolving credit facility and a term loan that could be reset up to a maximum amount of $ 100,000 , once per fiscal year, if certain conditions were met. The Prior ABL Facility had a maturity date of
December 18, 2023 .
Prior ABL Facility borrowings bore interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of
1.25 % to
1.75 %, or the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of
0.25 % to
0.75 %, with interest paid on a monthly basis. In connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, UNIFI recorded a $ 273
loss on debt extinguishment to interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Construction Financing In May 2021, UNIFI entered into an agreement with a third party lender that provides for construction-period financing for certain texturing machinery included in our capital allocation plans. UNIFI records project costs to construction in progress and the corresponding liability to construction financing (within long-term debt). The agreement provides for monthly, interest-only payments during the construction period at a rate of SOFR plus
1.25 %, and contains terms customary for a financing of this type.
Each borrowing under the agreement provides for
60
monthly payments, which will commence upon the completion of the construction period. In connection with this construction financing arrangement, UNIFI has borrowed a total of $ 8,122
and transitioned $ 3,222
of completed asset costs to finance lease obligations as of January 1, 2023.

Income Tax Expense   UNIFI’s (benefit) provision for income taxes for the six months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021 was calculated by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax book income and adjusting for discrete items that occurred during the period.
The effective tax rates for the three months and six months ended January 1, 2023 varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to losses for which UNIFI does not expect to realize a future benefit and a discrete tax benefit related to the recovery of certain Brazilian income taxes paid in prior years.
The effective tax rates for the three months and six months ended December 26, 2021 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, earnings taxed at higher rates in foreign jurisdictions, and deferred tax on unremitted earnings.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits UNIFI regularly assesses the outcomes of both completed and ongoing examinations to ensure that its provision for income taxes is sufficient. Certain returns that remain open to examination have utilized carryforward tax attributes generated in prior tax years, including net operating losses, which could potentially be revised upon examination.
7.
Shareholders’ Equity On October 31, 2018, UNIFI announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a share repurchase program (the “2018 SRP”) under which UNIFI is authorized to acquire up to $ 50,000
of its common stock. Under the 2018 SRP, purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date. Repurchases, if any, are expected to be financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the ABL Revolver and are subject to applicable limitations and restrictions as set forth in the ABL Facility. UNIFI may discontinue repurchases at any time that management determines additional purchases are not beneficial or advisable.   8

Stock-Based Compensation On
October 29, 2020 , UNIFI’s shareholders approved the Unifi, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan set the number of shares available for future issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2020 Plan to
850 .
No additional awards can be granted under prior plans; however, awards outstanding under a respective prior plan remain subject to that plan’s provisions. The following table provides the number of awards remaining available for future issuance under the 2020 Plan as of January 1, 2023:
Authorized under the 2020 Plan

On October 27, 2021, UNIFI’s shareholders approved the Unifi, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) as described in Unifi, Inc.’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on September 2, 2021. The ESPP reserved
100
Company shares, is intended to be a qualified plan under applicable tax law, and allows eligible employees to purchase Company shares at a
15 % discount from market value. ESPP activity is reflected as options exercised in the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
9.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Financial Instruments Grantor Trust The UNIFI, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”), established in fiscal 2022, is an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which certain key employees are eligible to participate.
The fair value of the investment assets held by the grantor trust established in connection with the DCP were approximately $ 2,897
and $ 2,196
as of January 1, 2023 and July 3, 2022, respectively, and are classified as trading securities within Other non-current assets.
The grantor trust assets have readily-available market values and are classified as Level 1 trading securities in the fair value hierarchy. Trading gains and losses associated with these investments are recorded to Other operating (income) expense, net. The associated DCP liability is recorded within Other long-term liabilities, and any increase or decrease in the liability is also recorded in Other operating (income) expense, net.
During fiscal 2023, we recorded net gains on investments held by the trust of $ 11 . Derivative Instruments UNIFI uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts or interest rate swaps to reduce its ongoing business exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
UNIFI does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Since June 2022, UNIFI has had
no
outstanding derivative instruments.   For the six months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, there were no significant changes to UNIFI’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and there were
no
transfers into or out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
UNIFI believes that there have been no significant changes to its credit risk profile or the interest rates available to UNIFI for debt issuances with similar terms and average maturities, and UNIFI estimates that the fair values of its debt obligations approximate the carrying amounts.
Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The financial statement carrying amounts of these items approximate the fair values due to their short-term nature.

Commitments and Contingencies Collective Bargaining Agreements While employees of UNIFI’s Brazilian operations are unionized, none of the labor force employed by UNIFI’s domestic or other foreign subsidiaries is currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Environmental On September 30, 2004, Unifi Kinston, LLC (“UK”), a subsidiary of Unifi, Inc., completed its acquisition of polyester filament manufacturing assets located in Kinston, North Carolina (“Kinston”) from Invista S.a.r.l. (“INVISTA”).
The land for the Kinston site was leased pursuant to a
99 -year ground lease (the “Ground Lease”) with E.I. DuPont de Nemours (“DuPont”).
Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program.
The program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern (“AOCs”), assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and remediate the AOCs to comply with applicable regulatory standards.
Effective March 20, 2008, UK entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at the Kinston site to DuPont.
This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved UK of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to UK’s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008.
At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same. UK continues to own property (the “Kentec site”) acquired in the 2004 transaction with INVISTA that has contamination from DuPont’s prior operations and is monitored by DEQ.
The Kentec site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DEQ to discontinue further remediation, other than natural attenuation.
Prior to transfer of responsibility to UK, DuPont and UK had a duty to monitor and report the environmental status of the Kentec site to DEQ. Effective April 10, 2019, UK assumed sole remediator responsibility of the Kentec site pursuant to its contractual obligations with INVISTA and received $ 180
of net monitoring and reporting costs due from DuPont.
In connection with monitoring, UK expects to sample and report to DEQ annually. At this time, UNIFI does not expect any active site remediation will be required but expects that any costs associated with active site remediation, if ever required, would likely be immaterial.

Business Segment Information UNIFI defines operating segments as components of the organization for which discrete financial information is available and operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by UNIFI’s principal executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Characteristics of UNIFI which were relied upon in making the determination of reportable segments include the nature of the products sold, the internal organizational structure, the trade policies in the geographic regions in which UNIFI operates, and the information that is regularly reviewed by the CODM for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. In the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2022, UNIFI realigned its operating and reportable segments to correspond with changes to its operating model, management structure, and organizational responsibilities, reflecting the manner in which business performance is evaluated, resources are allocated, and financial statement users can best understand the results of operations. Accordingly, UNIFI is now reporting the Americas Segment, Brazil Segment, and Asia Segment. The Americas Segment represents the combination of the previously reported Polyester Segment, Nylon Segment, and All Other category. There are no changes to the composition of the historical Brazil Segment and Asia Segment. Comparative prior period disclosures have been updated to conform to the new presentation. UNIFI has
three
reportable segments. • The operations within the Americas Segment exhibit similar long-term economic characteristics and primarily sell into an economic trading zone covered by the USMCA and CAFTA-DR to similar customers utilizing similar methods of distribution. These operations derive revenues primarily from manufacturing synthetic and recycled textile products with sales primarily to yarn manufacturers, knitters, and weavers that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, medical, and other end-use markets principally in North and Central America. The Americas Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S., El Salvador, and Colombia. • The Brazil Segment primarily manufactures and sells polyester-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, and other end-use markets principally in Brazil.
The Brazil Segment includes a manufacturing location and sales offices in Brazil. • The operations within the Asia Segment exhibit similar long-term economic characteristics and sell to similar customers utilizing similar methods of distribution primarily in Asia and Europe. The Asia Segment primarily sources synthetic and recycled textile products from third-party suppliers and sells to other yarn manufacturers, knitters, and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, and other end-use markets principally in Asia.
The Asia Segment includes sales offices in China, Turkey, and Hong Kong. UNIFI evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon Segment Profit, which represents segment gross (loss) profit plus segment depreciation expense. This measurement of segment profit or loss best aligns segment reporting with the current assessments and evaluations performed by, and information provided to, the CODM. The accounting policies for the segments are consistent with UNIFI’s accounting policies.
Intersegment sales are omitted from segment disclosures, as they are (i) insignificant to UNIFI’s segments and eliminated from consolidated reporting and (ii) excluded from segment evaluations performed by the CODM.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited)   In conjunction with the formation of UNFA, UNIFI entered into a supply agreement with UNF and UNFA whereby UNIFI agreed to purchase all of its first quality nylon POY requirements for texturing (subject to certain exceptions) from either UNF or UNFA.
The supply agreement has no stated minimum purchase quantities and pricing is typically negotiated every six months, based on market rates.
As of January 1, 2023, UNIFI’s open purchase orders related to this supply agreement were $ 1,722 . UNIFI’s raw material purchases under this supply agreement consisted of the following:

As of January 1, 2023 and July 3, 2022, UNIFI had combined accounts payable due to UNF and UNFA of $ 2,223
and $ 5,565 , respectively. UNIFI has determined that UNF and UNFA are variable interest entities and that UNIFI is the primary beneficiary of these entities, based on the terms of the supply agreement discussed above.
As a result, these entities should be consolidated with UNIFI’s financial results.
As (i) UNIFI purchases substantially all of the output from the two entities, (ii) the two entities’ balance sheets constitute
3 % or less of UNIFI’s current assets and total assets, and (iii) such balances are not expected to comprise a larger portion in the future, UNIFI has not included the accounts of UNF and UNFA in its consolidated financial statements and instead is accounting for these entities as equity investments.
As of January 1, 2023, UNIFI’s combined investments in UNF and UNFA were $ 2,430 .
The financial results of UNF and UNFA are included in UNIFI’s consolidated financial statements with a one-month lag, using the equity method of accounting and with intercompany profits eliminated in accordance with UNIFI’s accounting policy.
Other than the supply agreement discussed above, UNIFI does not provide any other commitments or guarantees related to either UNF or UNFA.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected UNIFI’s operations, along with material changes in financial condition, during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. A reference to a “note” in this section refers to the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. A reference to the “current period” refers to the three-month period ended January 1, 2023, while a reference to the “prior period” refers to the three-month period ended December 26, 2021.
A reference to the “current six-month period” refers to the six-month period ended January 1, 2023, while a reference to the “prior six-month period” refers to the six-month period ended December 26, 2021. Such references may be accompanied by certain phrases for added clarity. The current period and the prior period each consisted of 13 weeks. The current six-month period and the prior six-month period each consisted of 26 weeks.
Our discussions in this Item 2 focus on our results during, or as of, the three months and six months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, and, to the extent applicable, any material changes from the information discussed in the 2022 Form 10-K or other important intervening developments or information.
These discussions should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K for more detailed and background information about our business, operations, and financial condition.
Discussion of foreign currency translation is primarily associated with changes in the Brazilian Real (“BRL”) and changes in the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) versus the U.S. Dollar (“USD”). Weighted average exchange rates were as follows:

Overview and Significant General Matters
UNIFI focuses on delivering products and solutions to direct customers and brand partners throughout the world, leveraging our internal manufacturing capabilities and an enhanced global supply chain that delivers a diverse range of synthetic and recycled fibers and polymers. Our strategic initiatives include (i) leveraging our competitive advantages to grow market share in each of the major geographies we serve, (ii) expanding our presence in non-apparel markets with additional REPREVE ®
products, (iii) advancing the development and commercialization of innovative and sustainable solutions, and (iv) increasing brand awareness for REPREVE ® . We believe our strategic initiatives will increase revenue and profitability and generate improved cash flows from operations.
Current Economic Environment
The current economic environment and significant decrease in textile product demand has adversely impacted our consolidated sales and profitability in fiscal 2023. In addition to the current unfavorable economic environment and the inventory destocking measures taken by brands and retailers, the following pressures have continued from fiscal 2022 into fiscal 2023: (i) the impact of inflation on consumer spending, (ii) rising interest rates, (iii) the Russia-Ukraine conflict, (iv) global input cost volatility, and (v) supply chain disruption. UNIFI will continue to monitor these and other aspects of the current economic environment and work closely with stakeholders to ensure business continuity and liquidity.
Input Costs and Global Production Volatility
In addition to the escalation of input costs in fiscal 2022, UNIFI experienced inefficiencies in the global supply chain in connection with (i) freight costs and logistics slowdowns in foreign markets; (ii) a tighter labor pool in the U.S.; and (iii) suppressed productivity from our business partners resulting from pandemic-related lockdowns in certain regions, particularly Asia. Despite significant improvement in input and freight costs and a more stable labor pool during the current period, the global demand volatility and uncertainty that began in late fiscal 2022 has continued through the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as the threat of recession continues to create uncertainty for calendar 2023. The existing challenges and future uncertainty, particularly for rising input costs, labor productivity, and global demand, could worsen and/or continue for prolonged periods, materially impacting our consolidated sales and gross profit. Also, the need for future selling price adjustments in connection with inflationary costs could impact our ability to retain current customer programs and compete successfully for new programs in certain regions.
Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
UNIFI continuously reviews performance indicators to measure its success.
These performance indicators form the basis of management’s discussion and analysis included below:
• sales volume and revenue for UNIFI and for each reportable segment;
• gross (loss) profit and gross margin for UNIFI and for each reportable segment;
• net (loss) income and diluted EPS;
• Segment (Loss) Profit, which equals segment gross (loss) profit plus segment depreciation expense;
• unit conversion margin, which represents unit net sales price less unit raw material costs, for UNIFI and for each reportable segment;
• working capital, which represents current assets less current liabilities;
• Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), which represents net (loss) income before net interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense;
• Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude, from time to time, certain other adjustments necessary to understand and
15
compare the underlying results of UNIFI;
• Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, which represents net (loss) income calculated under GAAP, adjusted to exclude certain amounts which management believes do not reflect the ongoing operations and performance of UNIFI and/or for which exclusion may be necessary to understand and compare the underlying results of UNIFI;
• Adjusted EPS, which represents Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by UNIFI’s diluted weighted average common shares outstanding;
• Adjusted Working Capital, which equals receivables plus inventories and other current assets, less accounts payable and other current liabilities; and
• Net Debt, which represents debt principal less cash and cash equivalents.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Working Capital, and Net Debt (collectively, the “non-GAAP financial measures”) are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures are subjective, based on management’s belief as to which items should be included or excluded in order to provide the most reasonable and comparable view of the underlying operating performance of the business. We may, from time to time, modify the amounts used to determine our non-GAAP financial measures. When applicable, management’s discussion and analysis includes specific consideration for items that comprise the reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures better reflect UNIFI’s underlying operations and performance and that their use, as operating performance measures, provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets, among otherwise comparable companies.
Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of items (a) directly related to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and/or (b) that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis; (ii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; (iii) as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business; and (iv) as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance metric utilized in the determination of variable compensation. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because it serves as a high-level proxy for cash generated from operations and is relevant to our fixed charge coverage ratio.
Management uses Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted EPS (i) as measurements of net operating performance because they assist us in comparing such performance on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of (a) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis and (b) components of the provision for income taxes that we would not expect to occur as a part of our underlying taxable operations; (ii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; and (iii) as measures in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions.
Management uses Adjusted Working Capital as an indicator of UNIFI’s production efficiency and ability to manage inventories and receivables.
Management uses Net Debt as a liquidity and leverage metric to determine how much debt would remain if all cash and cash equivalents were used to pay down debt principal.

17
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales for the current period decreased by $65,198, or 32.4%, and consolidated sales volumes decreased 35.6%, compared to the prior period. The decreases occurred primarily due to lower volumes in the Americas and Asia Segments as a result of lower global demand in connection with the inventory de-stocking efforts of major brands and retailers, in addition to pandemic-related lockdowns in Asia, partially offset by higher selling prices in response to increasing raw material and input costs.
Consolidated weighted average sales prices increased 3.2%, primarily attributable to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material costs.
REPREVE ®
Fiber products for the current period comprised 31%, or $42,866, of consolidated net sales, down from 40%, or $81,524, for the prior period. The lower volumes and net sales in the Asia Segment, which has the highest portion of REPREVE ®
Fiber sales as a percentage of segment net sales, was the main driver for the lower REPREVE ®
Fiber sales.
Gross (Loss) Profit
Gross profit for the current period decreased by $24,890, or 147.4%, compared to the prior period. Gross profit decreased as a result of the decline in net sales, combined with weak fixed cost absorption for the Americas Segment, where utilization and productivity are materially impactful to gross profit. Although raw material costs for the Americas Segment have decreased meaningfully in fiscal 2023, the associated benefit was muted by low production levels, weak demand, and higher priced raw material inventory purchased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.
• For the Americas Segment, gross profit decreased due to weaker global demand and weak fixed cost absorption in connection with lower production, along with the impact of higher priced raw material inventory purchased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.
• For the Brazil Segment, gross profit decreased primarily due to the combination of high priced raw material inventory purchased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 and decreasing market prices in Brazil due to lower cost import competition.
• For the Asia Segment, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes in connection with weaker global demand and pandemic-related lockdowns in Asia.
SG&A
SG&A was generally flat as the prior period included a reduction in incentive compensation expense while the current period included lower discretionary spending.
Benefit for Bad Debts
The current period and prior period bad debt changes reflect no material activity.
Other Operating Expense, Net
The current period and prior period include foreign currency transaction (gains) losses of $(78) and $297, respectively in addition to $298 of severance costs recorded in the prior period.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased in connection with higher debt principal following continued capital investments and higher interest rates. Interest expense, net for the current period includes $273 of loss on debt extinguishment.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates
There was no material activity for the current period or the prior period.
Income Taxes
(Benefit) provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate were as follows:

(Benefit) provision for income taxes
$
(3,070
)
$

Effective tax rate
14.5
%
77.4
%
The effective tax rate is subject to variation due to a number of factors, including: variability in pre-tax book income; the mix of income by jurisdiction; changes in deferred tax valuation allowances; and changes in statutes, regulations, and case law. Additionally, the impacts of discrete and other rate impacting items are more pronounced when income (loss) before income taxes is lower.
The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior period to the current period is primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit related to the recovery of certain Brazilian income taxes paid in prior years, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the current period.
18
Net (Loss) Income
The decrease in net (loss) income was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit and the associated adverse impact of lower U.S. earnings on the effective tax rate.
Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily in connection with lower gross profit.
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP Financial Measures)
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted EPS decreased from the prior period to the current period, commensurate with the decrease in net (loss) income.
Segment Overview
Following is a discussion and analysis of the revenue and profitability performance of UNIFI’s reportable segments for the current period.
Americas Segment

(1) In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, UNIFI recorded a recovery of income taxes in connection with filing amended tax returns in Brazil relating to certain income taxes paid in prior fiscal years.
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales for the current six-month period decreased by $81,671, or 20.6%, and consolidated sales volumes decreased 28.6%, compared to the prior six-month period. The decreases occurred primarily due to lower volumes in the Americas and Asia Segments as a result of lower global demand in connection with the inventory de-stocking efforts of major brands and retailers, in addition to pandemic-related lockdowns in Asia, partially offset by higher selling prices in response to increasing raw material and input costs.
Consolidated weighted average sales prices increased 8.0%, primarily attributable to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material costs.
REPREVE ®
Fiber products for the current six-month period comprised 29%, or $92,045, of consolidated net sales, down from 39%, or $153,430, for the prior six-month period. The lower volumes and net sales in the Asia Segment, which has the highest portion of REPREVE ®
Fiber sales as a percentage of segment net sales, was the main driver for the lower REPREVE ®
Fiber sales.
Gross (Loss) Profit
Gross (loss) profit for the current six-month period decreased by $44,424, or 103.3%, compared to the prior six-month period. Gross profit decreased as a result of the decline in net sales, combined with weak fixed cost absorption for the Americas Segment, where utilization and productivity are materially impactful to gross profit. Although raw material costs for the Americas Segment decreased meaningfully in the current six-month period, the associated benefit was muted by low production levels, weak demand, and higher priced raw material inventory purchased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.
• For the Americas Segment, gross profit decreased due to weaker global demand and weak fixed cost absorption in connection with lower production.
• For the Brazil Segment, gross profit decreased primarily due to the combination of high priced raw material inventory purchased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 and decreasing market prices in Brazil due to lower cost import competition.
• For the Asia Segment, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes in connection with weaker global demand and pandemic-related lockdowns in Asia.
SG&A
SG&A for the current six-month period decreased compared to the prior six-month period, primarily due to (i) lower incentive compensation for the current six-month period and (ii) lower discretionary expenses, including marketing and advertising.
Provision (Benefit) for Bad Debts
The current six-month period and prior six-month period bad debt changes reflect no material activity.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
The current six-month period and prior six-month period include foreign currency transaction (gains) losses of $(803) and $530, respectively, in addition to $314 of severance costs in the prior six-month period.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased in connection with higher debt principal following continued capital investments and higher interest rates. Interest expense, net for the current six-month period includes $273 of loss on debt extinguishment.
22
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates
There was no material activity for the current six-month period or the prior six-month period.
Income Taxes
(Benefit) provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate were as follows:

Effective tax rate

%

%
The effective tax rate is subject to variation due to a number of factors, including: variability in pre-tax book income; the mix of income by jurisdiction; changes in deferred tax valuation allowances; and changes in statutes, regulations, and case law. Additionally, the impacts of discrete and other rate impacting items are more pronounced when income (loss) before income taxes is lower.
The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior six-month period to the current six-month period is primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit related to the recovery of certain Brazilian income taxes paid in prior years, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the current six-month period.
Net (Loss) Income
The decrease in net (loss) income was primarily attributable to the decrease in Americas gross profit and the associated adverse impact of lower U.S. earnings on the effective tax rate.
Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily in connection with lower gross profit.
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP Financial Measures)
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted EPS decreased from the prior six-month period to the current period, commensurate with the decrease in net (loss) income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Note 5, “Long-Term Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial statements includes the detail of UNIFI’s debt obligations and terms and conditions thereof.
Further discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources follow.
UNIFI’s primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and share repurchases.
UNIFI’s primary sources of capital are cash generated from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Revolver of its credit facility.
For the current six-month period, cash provided by operations was $7,272, and, at January 1, 2023, excess availability under the ABL Revolver was $64,694.
As of January 1, 2023, all of UNIFI’s $130,391 of debt obligations were guaranteed by certain of its domestic operating subsidiaries, while approximately 99% of UNIFI’s cash and cash equivalents were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may not be presently available to fund UNIFI’s domestic capital requirements, including its domestic debt obligations. UNIFI employs a variety of strategies to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations where it is needed.
The following table presents a summary of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings available under financing arrangements, liquidity, working capital, and total debt obligations as of January 1, 2023 for domestic operations compared to foreign operations:

$
130,391
UNIFI’s primary cash requirements, in addition to normal course operating activities (e.g. working capital and payroll), primarily include (i) capital expenditures that generally have commitments of up to 12 months, (ii) contractual obligations that support normal course ongoing operations and production, (iii) operating leases and finance leases, (iv) debt service, and (v) share repurchases.
Liquidity Considerations
UNIFI navigated the impact on liquidity of the COVID-19 pandemic by diligently managing the balance sheet and operational spending, in addition to utilizing cash received from a minority interest divestiture in April 2020. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, global demand recovery allowed for strong results and cash generation in fiscal 2021. However, inflation and demand uncertainty in fiscal 2022 and during the current six-month period have introduced new pressures to liquidity.
Following the establishment of the 2022 Credit Agreement, UNIFI’s cash and liquidity positions are sufficient to sustain its operations and meet its growth needs. However, further degradation in the macroeconomic environment could introduce additional liquidity risk and require UNIFI to limit cash outflows for capital expenditures and discretionary activities while further utilizing available and additional forms of credit. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the date of this report, we have not:
• taken advantage of rent, lease or debt deferrals, forbearance periods, or other concessions or
• relied on supply chain financing, structured trade payables, or vendor financing.
25
Although global demand for the remainder of calendar 2023 is uncertain, we do not currently anticipate that any adverse events or circumstances will place critical pressure on our liquidity position or our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and expected business growth. Should global demand, economic activity, or input availability decline considerably for a prolonged period of time, UNIFI maintains the ability to (i) seek additional credit or financing arrangements and/or (ii) re-implement cost reduction initiatives to preserve cash and secure the longevity of the business and operations.
Additionally, UNIFI considers opportunities to deploy existing cash to preserve or enhance liquidity. In August 2022, we repatriated approximately $14,000 from our operations in Asia to the U.S. via an existing intercompany note and, after remitting the appropriate withholding taxes, utilized the cash to reduce our outstanding revolver borrowings, thereby increasing the availability. Management regularly evaluates such repatriations and maintains the ability to take additional, similar actions from time to time, as circumstances warrant.
For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we expect the majority of our capital will be deployed to (i) upgrade the machinery in our U.S., El Salvador, and Brazil manufacturing facilities via capital expenditures and (ii) support working capital needs associated with recovering demand and product sales. Nonetheless, we understand the current global economic risks and we are prepared to act swiftly and diligently to ensure the vitality of the business.
The following outlines the attributes relating to our credit facility as of January 1, 2023:
• UNIFI was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants in the 2022 Credit Agreement;
• excess availability under the ABL Revolver was $64,694;
• the Trigger Level (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) was $23,000; and
• $0 of standby letters of credit were outstanding.
In addition to making payments in accordance with the scheduled maturities of debt required under its existing debt obligations, UNIFI may, from time to time, elect to repay additional amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility.
Funds to make such repayments may come from the operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon UNIFI’s strategy, prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
Liquidity Summary
UNIFI has met its historical liquidity requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and other operating needs from its cash flows from operations and available borrowings.
UNIFI believes that its existing cash balances, cash provided by operating activities, and credit facility will enable UNIFI to meet its foreseeable liquidity requirements.
Domestically, UNIFI’s cash balances, cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings available under the ABL Revolver continue to be sufficient to fund UNIFI’s domestic operating activities as well as cash commitments for its investing and financing activities.
For its foreign operations, UNIFI expects its existing cash balances, cash provided by operating activities, and available foreign financing arrangements will provide the needed liquidity to fund the associated operating activities and investing activities, such as future capital expenditures.
UNIFI’s foreign operations in Asia and Brazil are in a position to obtain local country financing arrangements due to the operating results of each subsidiary.

When comparing from July 3, 2022 to January 1, 2023, working capital and Adjusted Working Capital decreased.
The decrease in receivables, net was primarily due to (i) a decrease in sales following lower global demand and (ii) a decrease in banker’s acceptance notes held by our Asia Segment.
The decrease in inventories was primarily attributable to a decline in raw material purchases and costs in the current six-month period. The decrease in other current assets was primarily due to utilization of the fiscal 2021 recovery of non-income taxes in Brazil and lower vendor deposits. The decrease in accounts payable followed the decrease in inventories and production activity in the current six-month period. The decrease in other current liabilities primarily reflects the routine timing differences for payroll and other operating expenses.
The changes in current operating lease liabilities, current portion of long-term debt, income taxes receivable, and income taxes payable were insignificant.

Net cash provided (used) by operating activities

$
(3,950
)
The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to reducing working capital associated with a decline in overall business activity in the current six-month period, which was primarily offset by significantly weaker earnings.
Investing Cash Flows
Investing activities primarily includes $23,950 for capital expenditures.
During the current six-month period, UNIFI invested $23,950 in capital projects, primarily relating to (i) eAFK Evo texturing machinery, (ii) further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the Americas, and (iii) routine annual maintenance capital expenditures.
Maintenance capital expenditures are necessary to support UNIFI’s current operations, capacities, and capabilities and exclude expenses relating to repairs and costs that do not extend an asset’s useful life.
UNIFI expects recent and future capital projects to provide benefits to future profitability. The additional assets from these capital projects consist primarily of machinery and equipment.
27
Financing Cash Flows
Financing activities primarily include (i) scheduled payments against the ABL Term Loan and finance leases, (ii) proceeds and payments on the ABL Revolver, and (iii) proceeds from construction financing during the current six-month period.
Share Repurchase Program
As described in Note 7, “Shareholders’ Equity,” no share repurchases have been completed in fiscal 2023.
Contractual Obligations
UNIFI incurs various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
Financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that UNIFI is required to make under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements.
After considering the changes generated by the 2022 Credit Agreement, there have been no further material changes in the scheduled maturities of UNIFI’s contractual obligations as disclosed under the heading “Contractual Obligations” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2022 Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
UNIFI is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on UNIFI’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital expenditures.
Critical Accounting Policies
UNIFI’s critical accounting policies are discussed in the 2022 Form 10-K.
There have been no changes to UNIFI’s critical accounting policies in fiscal 2023.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
UNIFI is exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and raw material and commodity costs, which may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
UNIFI does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk
UNIFI is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities.
As of January 1, 2023, UNIFI had borrowings under its ABL Facility that totaled $118,400. UNIFI’s sensitivity analysis indicates that a 50-basis point interest rate increase as of January 1, 2023 would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $600.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
A complete discussion of foreign currency exchange rate risk is included in the 2022 Form 10-K and is supplemented by the following disclosures.
As of January 1, 2023, UNIFI had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.
As of January 1, 2023, foreign currency exchange rate risk concepts included the following:

Raw Material and Commodity Cost Risks
A complete discussion of raw material and commodity cost risks is included in the 2022 Form 10-K and is supplemented by the following disclosures.
28
As fiscal 2022 concluded, UNIFI experienced cost increases for raw materials related to inflationary pressures and competing alternatives to U.S. polyester production. Following the recent global demand deterioration, raw material costs have declined in fiscal 2023. We have been able to implement responsive selling price adjustments for the majority of our portfolio throughout fiscal 2022 and 2023.
While our underlying gross margin is predominantly pressured by lower textile demand, we expect the impact of recent selling price adjustments to aid margin improvement throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023. Nonetheless, input costs remain subject to volatility, and, should inputs costs increase unexpectedly or should textile demand worsen, UNIFI’s results of operations and cash flows are likely to be adversely impacted.
Other Risks
UNIFI is also exposed to political risk, including changing laws and regulations governing international trade, such as quotas, tariffs, and tax laws.
The degree of impact and the frequency of these events cannot be predicted.
Item 4. Controls
and Procedures
As of January 1, 2023, an evaluation of the effectiveness of UNIFI’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of UNIFI’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, UNIFI’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that UNIFI’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by UNIFI in its reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by UNIFI in the reports UNIFI files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to UNIFI’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There were no changes in UNIFI’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended January 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UNIFI’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II—OTHE R INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal
Proceedings
We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain self-insurance limits.
