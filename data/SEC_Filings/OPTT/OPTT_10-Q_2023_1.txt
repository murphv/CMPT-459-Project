Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
We
have made statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking
statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, pending, threatened, and current litigation,
liquidity, budgets, projected revenue and costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words “may,”
“continue,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “believe,”
“project,” “expect,” “anticipate”, and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements,
but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.
The
forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference are largely based on our expectations, which reflect estimates and
assumptions made by management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions
and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve several
risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including:
● our
ability to develop, market and commercialize our products, and achieve and sustain profitability;
● our
continued development of our proprietary technologies, and expected continued use of cash
from operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization
of our products and services;
● our
ability to obtain additional funding, as and if needed, which will be subject to several
factors, including market conditions, and our operating performance;
● the
continued impact of COVID-19 and the inflation related to the U.S. dollar on our business,
operations, customers, suppliers and manufacturers and personnel;
● our
ability to meet product development, manufacturing and customer delivery deadlines may be
impacted by disruptions to our supply chain, primarily related to labor shortages and manufacturing
and transportation delays both here in the U.S. and abroad;
● our
acquisitions and our ability to integrate them into our operations may use significant resources,
be unsuccessful or expose us to unforeseen liabilities;
● our
estimates regarding future expenses, revenues, and capital requirements;
● our
ability to identify and penetrate markets for our products, services, and solutions;
● our
ability to effectively respond to competition in our targeted markets
● our
ability to establish relationships with our existing and future strategic partners may not
be successful;
● our
ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American;
● the
reliability of our technology, products and solutions;
● our
ability to improve the power output and survivability of our products;
● changes
in current legislation, regulations and economic conditions that affect the demand for, or
restrict the use of our products;
● our
ability to hire and retain key personnel, including senior management, to achieve our business
objectives;
● our
history of operating losses, which we expect to continue for at least the short term and
possibly longer; and
● our
ability to protect our intellectual property portfolio.
Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this report may turn out to be inaccurate. We have based these forward-looking statements
largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make
or unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, and in our subsequent reports under the Exchange Act. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur as contemplated
and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by the forward-looking statements.
Many
of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general
or specific factors that may affect us. You should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of this filing. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
new information or future events or otherwise.

Power Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements

Background, Basis of Presentation and Liquidity
(a)
Background
Ocean
Power Technologies, Inc. (“OPTI”) was founded in 1984 in New Jersey, commenced business operations in 1994 and
re-incorporated in Delaware in 2007. Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. acquired 3dent Technology, LLC (“3Dent”), in
February 2021 and Marine Advanced Robotics, Inc. (“MAR”) in November 2021, both of which are now included as part of
OPTI. OPTI, along with its subsidiaries, (the “Company”) is a complete solutions provider, controlling the design,
manufacturing, sales, installation, operations and maintenance of its products and services. The Company’s solutions provide
distributed offshore power and data which is persistent, reliable, autonomous, renewable, and economical along with power,
transportation, and communications for remote surface and subsea applications. Historically, funding from government agencies, such
as research and development grants, accounted for a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. The Company’s
objective is to generate the majority of its revenues from the sale or lease of its products and solutions, and sales of services to
support business operations.
(b)
Basis of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and for interim financial information in accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The interim operating results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year or for any other interim period. Further information on potential factors that could affect
the Company’s financial results can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022,
as filed with the SEC and elsewhere in our subsequent Exchange Act filings, including this Form 10-Q. Certain items have been reclassified
from prior periods to be consistent with current GAAP presentations.
(c)
Liquidity
For
the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred net losses of approximately $ 16.8
million, used cash in operations of approximately $ 16.1
million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 270.6
million. The Company has continued to make investments in ongoing product development efforts and to build inventory in anticipation
of, and to support, future growth. The Company’s future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could affect the Company’s future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from
expectations include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties identified under “Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The Company previously obtained equity financing through
its At the Market Offering Agreement (“ATM”) with A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) and through its
equity line financing with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (“Aspire Capital”), but the Company cannot be certain that
additional equity and/or debt financing will be available to the Company as needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Management
believes the Company’s current cash balance at January 31, 2023 of $ 11.0
million and short term investments balance of $ 30.0
million is sufficient to fund its planned expenditures through at least March 2024.
On
November 20, 2020, the Company entered into an At-the-Market Offering Agreement with AGP (the “2020 ATM Facility”)
pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of the Company’s common stock
having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 100.0
million. The Company’s common stock will be sold at prevailing
market prices at the time of sale, and, as a result, prices will vary. Although the Company initially only had filed to sell up
to $ 50.0
million, a prospectus supplement was filed on January 10, 2022 to allow the Company to sell an additional $ 25.0
million of common stock up to a total
of $ 75.0
million under the 2020 ATM Facility. As of
January 31, 2023, an aggregate of $ 50.0
million remained available under this facility, subject to the filing of a prospectus
supplement for an additional $ 25.0
million.

Table of Contents
On
September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital which provided that, subject to certain
terms, conditions and limitations, Aspire Capital was committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $ 12.5
million shares of the Company’s
common stock over a 30-month period subject to a limit of
19.99 %
of the outstanding common stock on the date of the agreement if the
price did not exceed a specified price in the agreement. The number of shares the Company could issue within the
19.99 %
limit was
3,722,251
shares without shareholder approval. Shareholder approval was received at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders on December
23, 2020 for the sale of
9,864,706
additional shares of common stock which exceeded the
19.99 %
limit of the outstanding common stock
on the date of the agreement. Through January 31, 2023, the Company had sold an aggregate of
3,722,251
shares of common stock with an
aggregate market value of $ 11.8
million at an average price of $ 3.17
per share pursuant to this common stock purchase agreement with
approximately $ 0.7
million remaining on the facility as of January 31, 2023.
(2)
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, Ocean Power Technologies
Ltd. in the United Kingdom, and Ocean Power Technologies (Australasia) Pty Ltd. in Australia (“OPT-A”). OPT-A is in the process
of being liquidated due to inactivity. All documents have been filed with the Australian Tax Organization and the Company expects this
to be completed in the current fiscal year. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b)
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, among other items, stock-based
compensation, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash
flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability
of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and the related amortization methods and periods, and estimated hours and
costs to complete customer contracts for purposes of revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(c)
Cash,
Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Security Agreements and Short Term Investments
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
Company invests excess cash in a money market account or in short term investments that are held-to-maturity.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 10.9
million as of January 31, 2023 and $ 7.9
million as of April 30, 2022.
Restricted
Cash and Security Agreements
The
Company has a letter of credit agreement with Santander Bank, N.A. (“Santander”). Cash of $ 154,000
is on deposit at Santander
and serves as security for a letter of credit issued by Santander for the lease of warehouse/office space in Monroe Township, New Jersey.
This agreement cannot be extended beyond July 31, 2025 and is cancellable at the discretion of the bank.
Santander
also issued a letter of credit to subsidiaries of Enel Green Power (“EGP”) pursuant to the Company’s contracts with
EGP. This letter of credit was originally issued in the amount of $ 645,000 , and was reduced to $ 323,000
in August 2020. The letter of
credit was further reduced by an additional $ 258,000
during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 when the PowerBuoy® (“PB3”)
and its accompanying systems passed final acceptance testing. The remaining restricted amount of $ 65,000
will be released in January
2024, which is 12 months after the buoy is fully deployed.

During
fiscal 2022, the Company acquired investment securities through Charles Schwab Bank. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, their
carrying value was approximately $ 30.0
million and $ 49.4

within 12 months. The Company has the ability and the intention to hold all investments to maturity, and as such are classified as held-to-maturity
investments and carried at amortized cost. The total recognized interest expense on the premium we paid for the securities for the nine
month period ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 is approximately $ 0.2
million and
zero ,
respectively. Additionally, there has been no impairment on these investments.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable, short term
investments and cash equivalents. The Company believes that its credit risk is limited because the
Company’s current contracts are with entities with a reliable payment history. The Company invests its excess cash in a money
market fund and short term held-to maturity investments and does not believe that it is exposed to any significant risks related to
its cash accounts, money market fund, or held-to maturity investments. Cash is also maintained at foreign financial institutions.
Cash in foreign financial institutions as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $ 14,000 .
For
the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had two and four customers whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of
the Company’s consolidated revenues, respectively. These revenues accounted for approximately
28 %
and
58 %
of the Company’s
total revenues for the respective periods. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had five and four customers
whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues, respectively. These revenues accounted for approximately
63 %
and
71 %
of the Company’s total revenues for the respective periods.

Share-Based Compensation
Costs
resulting from all share-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values. The
aggregate share-based compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended January 31,
2023 and 2022 was approximately $ 0.9
million and $ 0.9
million, respectively. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, share-based
compensation expense was $ 0.3
million in each period.
(f)
Revenue Recognition
The
Company accounts for revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606) for contracts with customers and
Accounting Standards Codification 842 (ASC 842) for leasing arrangements. In relation to ASC 606, which states that a performance
obligation is the unit of account for revenue recognition, the Company assesses the goods or services promised in a contract with a
customer and identifies as a performance obligation as either: a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is
distinct; or b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to
the customer. A contract may contain a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. For contracts with
multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon
the relative standalone selling price, which represents the price the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a
customer. The Company determines the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or
service. When no observable standalone selling price is available, the standalone selling price is generally estimated based upon
the Company’s forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.
The
nature of the Company’s contracts may give rise to several types of variable consideration, including unpriced change orders, liquidated
damages and penalties. Variable consideration can also arise from modifications to the scope of services. Variable consideration is included
in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once
the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of
whether to include such amounts in the transaction price are based largely on our assessment of legal enforceability, performance, and
any other information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. There was no variable consideration as
of January 31, 2023 or 2022. The Company presents shipping and handling costs, that occur after control of the promised goods or services
transfer to the customer, as fulfillment costs in costs of goods sold and regular shipping and handling activities charged to operating
expenses.
The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer, either (1)
at a point in time or (2) over time. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control. The evaluation of whether
control of each performance obligation is transferred at a point in time or over time is made at contract inception. Input measures such
as costs incurred are utilized to assess progress against specific contractual performance obligations for the Company’s services.
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services to be
provided. For the Company, the input method using costs incurred or labor hours best represents the measure of progress against the performance
obligations incorporated within the contractual agreements. If estimated total costs on any contract project a loss, the Company charges
the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effect of revisions to revenue, estimated
costs to complete contracts, including penalties, change orders, claims, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the accounting
period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated. These loss projects are re-assessed
for each subsequent reporting period until the project is complete. Such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material.
The
Company’s contracts are either cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts, time and material agreements, lease or service agreements.
Under cost plus contracts, customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreed-upon fee.
12
Table of Contents
The
Company has two types of fixed-price contracts, firm fixed-price and cost-sharing. Under firm fixed-price contracts, the Company receives
an agreed-upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract, and a profit or loss is recognized depending on
whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount. Under cost-sharing contracts, the fixed amount agreed upon with the
customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project. Under cost sharing contracts, an amount corresponding
to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenues, resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero. The Company’s share of the
costs is recorded as product development expense. The Company reports its disaggregation of revenues by contract type since this method
best represents the Company’s business. For the nine-month periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company’s
contracts were classified as firm fixed-price.
The
Company at times enters into agreements with government agencies through Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) contract
agreements. These are typically fixed-priced agreements where the Company retains ownership of the data and grants the government a license
with unlimited rights to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly distribute the data.
Time
and materials agreements are billed based solely on the cost of time spent working on the contract and the material used.
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company’s total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $ 2.5
million.
The Company expects to recognize approximately
85 % , or $ 2.1
million, for the remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next
twelve months.
The
Company also enters into lease arrangements for its PowerBuoys and Wave Adaptive Modular Vessels (“WAM-V®”) with certain
customers. Revenue related to multiple-element arrangements is allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative standalone
selling prices or expected cost plus a margin approach. Lease elements generally include a PowerBuoy, WAM-V®, and components, while
non-lease elements, which the Company expects to become more prevalent, generally include engineering, monitoring and support services.
In the lease arrangement, the customer may be provided an option to extend the lease term or purchase the leased buoy or WAM-V® at
some point during and/or at the end of the lease term.
At
inception of a contract, the Company classifies leases as either operating or financing in accordance with the authoritative accounting
guidance contained within ASC Topic 842, “Leases”. If the direct financing or sales-type classification criteria are met,
then the lease is accounted for as a finance lease. All others are treated as operating leases.
The
Company recognizes revenue from operating lease arrangements generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or as agreed upon
in-use days are utilized, which is presented in Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The below table represents the
total revenue recognized under ASC 606 and ASC 842 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.

Other Income – Employee Retention Credit
The
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act provided an employee retention credit (“ERC”), which
was a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to $ 5,000
per employee for eligible employers. The tax
credit was equal to
50 %
of qualified wages paid to employees during a
quarter, capped at $ 10,000
of qualified wages per employee through December
31, 2020. Additional relief provisions were passed by the United States government, which extend and slightly expand the qualified wage
caps on these credits through December 31, 2021. Based on these additional provisions, the tax credit is now equal to
70 %
of qualified wages paid to employees during a
quarter, and the limit on qualified wages per employee has been increased to $ 10,000
of qualified wages per quarter.
During
the three-month period ended October 31, 2022, the Company determined that it qualified for the tax credit under “CARES”
and submitted claims of approximately $ 612,000
and $ 590,000
for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and recognized approximately $ 1,202,000
as other income in the statement of operations for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023. Claimed ERC’s are expected to
be settled during the year ended April 30, 2023 and have been recorded within other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet
as of January 31, 2023.
In
November 2022 the Company received approximately $ 205,000
from the IRS related to the receivable.
(h)
Net Loss per Common Share
Basic
and diluted net loss per common share for all periods presented is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
Due
to the Company’s net losses, potentially dilutive securities, consisting of options to purchase shares of common stock, potential
exercises of warrants on common stock and unvested restricted stock issued to employees and non-employee directors, were excluded from
the diluted loss per share calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect.
In
computing diluted net loss per common share on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, potential exercises of warrants on common stock,
options to purchase shares of common stock and non-vested restricted stock issued to employees and non-employee directors, totaling
8,010,373
and
6,356,123
for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from each of the computations as the effect
would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss for the periods.
(i)
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, “ Financial Instruments
-
Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”
This amendment replaces the incurred
loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses on instruments within its scope,
including trade receivables. This update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about
the expected credit losses. In November 2019, the FASB issued No. 2019-10,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326),
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for Smaller Reporting
Companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounts
Receivable
The
Company grants credit to its customers, generally without collateral, under normal payment terms (typically 30 to 60 days after invoicing).
Generally, invoicing occurs after the related services are performed or control of goods have transferred to the customer. Accounts receivable
represent an unconditional right to consideration arising from the Company’s performance under contracts with customers. The carrying
value of such receivables represents their estimated realizable value.
Contract
Assets
Contract
assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from arrangements whereby the right to payment is conditional on completing additional
tasks or services for a performance obligation. The decrease in contract assets is primarily a result of services performed relating
to MAR projects for which revenue was recognized in prior periods but was billed during the nine months ended January 31, 2023.
Significant
changes in the contract assets balances during the period were as follows:

Leases
Lessee
Information
Right-of-use
asset and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term
at commencement date. When the implicit rate of the lease is not provided or cannot be determined, the Company uses the incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at the effective date to determine the present value of future payments. Lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. The renewal options
have not been included in the lease term as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s operating leases consist
of leases for office facilities and warehouse space. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight- line basis
over the lease term and consists of interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset.
The
Company has a lease for its facility located in Monroe Township, New Jersey that is used as warehouse/production space and the Company’s
principal offices and corporate headquarters.
The lease includes an initial lease term of
seven years
which is set to expire in November
of 2024, and contains an option to extend the lease for another five years . The lease is classified as an operating lease and is included
in right-of-use assets, right-of-use liabilities current and lease liabilities-long-term on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The
Company also signed a new lease located in Houston, Texas for office space for our local employees. The lease term is for
1
year and is set to
expire
in January of 2024 . ASC 842 allows a company an accounting policy election to recognize lease payments within the
Consolidated Statement of Operations on a straight-line basis if the lease term is equal to or less than 12 months and not recognize
a right-of use asset and lease liability. The accounting policy election is made on the commencement date of the lease. The Company
has chosen this election for the Houston lease and classified it as a short-term lease.
17
Table of Contents
The
Company also has a lease with the University of California Berkeley in Richmond, California that was assumed as part of the MAR acquisition.
The lease is currently a month-to-month lease in accordance with the lease agreement. In accordance with ASC 842, since the remaining
lease term at the time of the acquisition of MAR was less than 12 months, the lease was not recognized as a right-of-use asset.
Subsequent to January 31, 2023 (see Note 18) the Company entered into a new lease for facility located in Oakland,
California with a commencement date to be determined upon completion of work to be performed by the landlord. The term of the lease is
for
62
months from the commencement date with an option of
the Company to terminate the lease after 39 months
if certain conditions are
met. The rent will be approximately $ 25,000
per month and the facility will be utilized for our MAR business.
The
operating lease cash flow payments for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 110,000
and $ 111,000 , respectively. The
operating lease cash flow payments for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 326,000

On
April 8, 2019, the Company issued and sold
1,542,000
shares of common stock, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to
3,385,680
shares of common stock. The public offering price for the pre-funded warrants was equal to the public offering price of the common
stock, less the $ 0.01
per share exercise price of each warrant. The pre-funded warrants have no expiration date. As of January 31, 2023, all of the
pre-funded warrants had been exercised.
The
underwritten public offering also included the issuance of common stock warrants to purchase up to
4,927,680
shares of common stock that have an exercise price of $ 3.85
per share and expire
five
years
from the issuance date. As of January 31, 2023, common warrants to purchase
732,500
shares of the common stock had been exercised.
The
pre-funded and common warrants issued in the Company’s April 8, 2019 public offering did not meet the criteria to be classified
as a liability award and therefore were treated as an equity award and recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Paycheck Protection Program Loan
On
March 27, 2020, the U.S. Government passed into law the CARES Act. On May 3, 2020, the Company signed a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)
loan with Santander as the lender for $ 890,000
in support through the Small Business Association (“SBA”) under the PPP Loan.
The PPP Loan was unsecured and evidenced by a note in favor of Santander and governed by a Loan Agreement with Santander. The Company
received the proceeds on May 5, 2020.
The
Company filed its loan forgiveness application at the end of February 2021 asking for

Share-Based Compensation
In
2015, upon approval by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”)
became effective. A total of
1,332,036
shares were authorized for issuance under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, including shares available
for awards under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan remaining at the time that plan terminated, or that were subject to awards under the 2006
Stock Incentive Plan that thereafter terminated by reason of expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise. If any award under the
2006 Stock Incentive Plan or 2015 Plan expires, is cancelled, terminates unexercised or is forfeited, those shares become again available
for grant under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan will terminate ten years after its effective date, in October 2025, but is subject to earlier
termination as provided in the 2015 Plan.
At
subsequent shareholder meetings, including most recently in January 2023, the shareholders approved an aggregate increase to the
2015 Plan of
3,050,000
shares resulting in total shares authorized for issuance of
4,382,036
as of January 2023. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had approximately
38,000
shares available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.
On
January 18, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Company’s Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (the
“2018 Inducement Plan”) pursuant to which the Company reserved
25,000
shares of common stock for issuance under the Inducement
Plan. In accordance with Rule 711(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide, awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals
not previously employees of the Company (or following such individuals’ bona fide period of non-employment with the Company), as
an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company. An award is any right to receive the Company’s
common stock pursuant to the 2018 Inducement Plan, consisting of a performance share award, restricted stock award, a restricted stock
unit award or a stock payment award. On February 9, 2022, the 2018 Inducement Plan was amended to increase the authorized shares by
250,000
to
275,000 . As of January 31, 2023, there were approximately
161,000
shares available for grant under the 2018 Inducement Plan. The 2015
Plan and the 2018 Inducement Plan together comprise the “Stock Incentive Plans”.
Stock
Options
The
Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award granted with service-based vesting requirements, using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, assuming no dividends, and using weighted average valuation assumptions. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life (estimated period
of time outstanding) of the stock options granted was estimated using the “simplified” method as permitted by the SEC’s
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110,
Share-Based Payment.
Expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility
over the expected life of the stock option granted.
The Company granted options to acquire
601,089
and
793,850
share of common stock
during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options granted in January
2023 was approximately $ 376,000.

Fair Value Measurements
ASC
Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurements”
states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are reported using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The following
is a description of the three hierarchy levels.
Level
1
Unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level
2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level
3 Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.
Disclosure
of Fair Values
The
Company’s financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
receivable, contract assets and liabilities, deposits, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The Company’s contingent consideration
liability represents the only asset or liability classified financial instrument that is measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The
total carrying value of our short term investments approximates fair value due to the short term nature of
these investments. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the carrying values were $ 30.0
million and $ 49.4
million, respectively.
Additionally,
there is a Level 3 contingent liability related to earnouts as part of the MAR acquisition in the amount of $ 1.7
million as of January 31, 2023 as the inputs are currently unobservable to determine this fair value. As of January 31, 2023, the
fair value of this contingent liability from the time that MAR was acquired has increased by approximately $ 0.1
million from $ 1.6
million.
Transfers
into or out of any hierarchy level are recognized at the end of the reporting period in which the transfers occurred. There were no transfers
between any hierarchy levels during each of the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.

Commitments and Contingencies
Spain
Income Tax Audit
The
Company underwent an income tax audit in Spain for the period from 2011 to 2014, when its Spanish branch was closed. On July 30, 2018,
the Spanish tax inspector concluded that although there was no tax owed in light of losses reported, the Company’s Spanish branch
owed penalties for failure to properly account for the income associated with the funding grant. During the year ended April 30, 2022,
the Company received notice from the Spanish Central Economic and Administrative Tribunal (“Spanish Tax Administration”)
that it agreed with the inspector and ruled that the Company owes the full amount of the penalty in the amount of € 279,870
or approximately
$ 331,000 . On January 25, 2021, the Company paid the Spanish Tax Administration € 279,870 . Notwithstanding that payment, on April
30, 2022, the Company filed its appeal of the decision of the Central Court to the Spanish National Court.
(16)
Income Taxes
Uncertain
Tax Positions
We
account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 . The guidance requires the Company to recognize in its consolidated financial statements
the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits
of the position.
The Company has no current or deferred tax due to current and projected losses for the year.
The Company has appealed the results of the income tax audit in Spain for the period from 2011 to 2014, when the Company’s
Spanish branch was closed (see Note 15).
At January 31, 2023, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. The Company does not expect
any material increase or decrease in its income tax expense or benefit in the next twelve months, related to examinations or uncertain
tax positions. Net operating loss and credit carry forwards since inception remain open to examination by taxing authorities and will
continue to remain open for a period of time after utilization.
Income
Tax Benefit
The
Company has sold New Jersey State net operating losses and research development credits under the New Jersey Economic Development Authority
Tax Transfer program which has resulted in $ 278,000
and $ 1.0
million of
income tax benefit related
to the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively.

Operating Segments and Geographic Information
The
Company’s business consists of
one
reportable segment as the revenues associated with its different business lines are not material
enough to justify segment reporting or to make it meaningful to investors, and our chief operating decision maker does not view the Company’s
operations on a segment basis. The Company operates worldwide, with its U.S. operations in New Jersey, California and Texas, one operating
subsidiary in the UK and one subsidiary which was discontinued during 2022 in Australia. Revenues and expenses are generally attributed
to the operating unit that bills the customers. During each of the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s
primary business operations were in North America.
(18)
Subsequent Events
The Company entered into a new lease for facility
located in Oakland, California with a commencement date to be determined upon completion of work to be performed by the landlord. The
term of the lease is for
62
months from the commencement date with an option of
the Company to terminate the lease after 39 months
if
certain conditions are met. The rent will be approximately $ 25,000
per month and the facility will be utilized for our MAR business.

related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this management’s discussion
and analysis is set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business,
pending and threatened litigation and our liquidity, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should
review the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 for a discussion of
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. References to a fiscal year in this Form 10-Q refer to the year ended
April 30 of that year (e.g., fiscal 2023 refers to the year ended April 30, 2023).
Overview
Our
solutions focus on three major service areas: Data as a Service (“DaaS”), which includes data collected by our Wave Adaptive
Modular Vessel (WAM-V®) autonomous vehicles or our PowerBuoy® product lines; Power as a Service (“PaaS”), which includes
our PowerBuoy® and subsea battery products; and our Strategic Consulting Services.
We
provide ocean data collection and reporting, marine power, offshore communications, and Maritime Domain Awareness
(“MDA”) products, integrated solutions, and consulting services. We offer our products and services to a wide range of
customers, including those in government and offshore energy, oil and gas, construction, wind power and other industries. We are
involved in the entire life cycle of product development, from product design through manufacturing, testing, deployment,
maintenance and upgrades, while working closely with partners across our supply chain. We also work closely with our third party
partners that provide us with, among other things, software, controls, sensors, integration services, and marine installation
services. Our solutions enable technologies for autonomous, zero or low carbon emitting economical data collection and analysis. Our
solutions also offer transportation and communication in ocean and other offshore environments and generate actionable intelligence
via a variety of inputs. We then channel the information we collect, and other communications, through control equipment linked to
edge computing and cloud hosting environments.
Our
mission is to provide intelligent maritime solutions and services that enable more secure and more productive utilization of our oceans
and waterways, provide clean energy power services, and offer sophisticated surface and subsea maritime domain awareness solutions. We
achieve this through our proprietary, state-of-the-art technologies that are at the core of our clean and renewable energy platforms,
and our solutions and services.
We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in April 1984 and began commercial operations in 1994. On April 23, 2007,
we reincorporated in Delaware.
Business
Update Regarding Macroeconomic Conditions
Adverse
macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, policy changes, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations
may have a negative impact on our business. Ongoing labor pool shortages are continuing and are impacting some of our delivery deadlines.
These adverse conditions could impact the spending budgets of our customers, and therefore could adversely affect the sales of our products
and services.
In addition, the Company maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions. Although we currently believe that the
financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions
will be able to continue to do so.
We
will continue to monitor these conditions, and, if necessary, adjust our operations in response to these conditions.

Our
Solutions
Data
as a Service
Our
DaaS solution is at the forefront of our strategic plan to be a leader in offshore data collection, integration, analytics and real time
communication for a variety of important applications. For example, our solutions can track surface vessel movement for maritime border
enforcement and illegal fishing interdiction, provide security for offshore wind farms and oil and gas fields, or provide harbor or port
security as well as logistics support. We have the ability to support aquaculture and gather information on ocean currents, water quality,
wind and other weather metrics, and map shorelines or subsurface areas. Additionally, we offer 24/7 monitoring solutions that can provide
meaningful real time information, and long term data collection and analytics for sophisticated applications across many industries and
scientific applications.
As
part of our DaaS offering, in
October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Adams Communication
& Engineering Technology, Inc. (“ACET”) to conduct a feasibility study for the evaluation of a
PB3 PowerBuoy®
(“PB3”)
power and 5G communications solution in support of the U.S. Navy’s Naval
Postgraduate School’s Sea, Land, Air, Military Research Initiative (“SLAMR”).
We have further expanded our Data
as a Service offering through field demonstration such as ANTX Coastal Trident 2022, as well as contracts with a US government services
provider for an MDAS demonstration off the US West Coast, Naval Task Force 59 for the Digital Horizon field exercise and the International
Maritime Exercise (IMX) in Bahrain, Sulmara for survey services, and Phase I funding through NOAA’s SBIR program.
Maritime
Domain Awareness Solution (“MDAS”)
The
International Maritime Organization defines Maritime Domain Awareness (“MDA”) as the effective understanding of any activity
that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment related to and within our oceans and seas. Since 2002, the United States
of America has had an active strategy to secure the maritime domain, primarily through the U.S. Navy. Furthermore, in 2020 the U.S. Coast
Guard elevated Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (“IUU”) fisheries, one aspect of MDA security, as the leading global maritime
threat.
We
have designed our solution to provide detailed, localized maritime domain awareness that can be utilized for a wide range of applications
across market segments. Our MDAS base hardware consists of a high-definition radar, a stabilized high-definition optical and thermal
imaging camera, and a vessel Automatic Identification System (“AIS”) detection module. This hardware can be customized or
supplemented by other solutions, depending on our customer’s requirements. These devices can be mounted on our products, such as
our PB3 or WAM-V®, and then utilizing integrated command and control software, data is sent to us and to our customers via secure
communications channels. Multiple sensors can be used on a single unit based on the comprehensiveness of customer needs. Capabilities
of our MDAS include 24/7 vessel tracking, automatic radar plotting, and high-definition optical and thermal video surveillance capable
of providing actionable intelligence day or night, in real time.
Our
MDAS processes data onboard our buoys using edge computing and transmits the results to our cloud-based analytics platform via secure
Wi-Fi, and cellular communications. We anticipate integrating WAM-Vs® into our MDAS solution to add mobile assets for patrols or
interdiction and utilizing satellite communication to expand the availability of our data service. Surveillance data can be integrated
with third party marine monitoring software or with our own MDA software solution developed together with leading partners in the technology
industry to provide command and control features of a multi-buoy surveillance network. This network can be coordinated with the use of
our WAM-Vs® so that customers can have mobile sensor networks linked to our self-powered buoy data and communication hubs. The data
can also be integrated with satellite, weather, bathymetric, and other third party data feeds to form a detailed surface and subsea picture
of a monitored area. All vessel video, radar, and track data is securely stored in our cloud, or the customer’s cloud, environment and is accessible for as long as required by the customers
for further analysis and reference.

Table of Contents
In
May 2022, the Company launched the first commercially-ready MDAS on a test buoy off the coast of New Jersey. The system includes our
proprietary integration of sensors, hardware and software, supported by cloud infrastructure as well as having a web-based user interface
that displays camera, radar, AIS and live chart data. We have successfully demonstrated the system multiple times for potential customers
and it was showcased in San Diego Bay at the U.S. Navy’s Advanced Naval Technology Exercise in August 2022. We continue to develop
our MDAS with hardware optimization and feature enhancements.
Autonomous
Vehicles (“WAM-V ® ”)
On
November 15, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Marine Advanced Robotics, Inc. (“MAR”).
Founded in 2004, MAR is the developer of the patented Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V®) technology, which enables roaming capabilities
for unmanned maritime systems in waters around the world. MAR launched the first WAM-V® in 2007 as a new vessel class to deliver
reliable autonomous surface vehicles to customers that could provide robust, real-time data collection and reporting. MAR also provides
RaaS, (Robotics as a Service) allowing customers to lease WAM-V® robotics and access information from our WAM-Vs® while we maintain
ownership and maintenance and repair responsibilities. Today, WAM-Vs® operate in 11 countries for commercial, military and scientific
uses. Our WAM-Vs® exist in three primary sizes, 8, 16, and 22 feet, however, many of the design components are common across the
sizes, allowing for integration of different payloads and adaption of the payload platforms for larger equipment. All sizes can be adapted
to suit different propulsion methods.
This
acquisition immediately provided the Company with an established product line that highly complements the Company’s business strategy
and can be used inshore, nearshore, and offshore. Since the acquisition, the business of MAR has continued to grow and is further expanding
into its core marine survey and maritime security markets in Europe, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. We continue to find ways to integrate
MAR technology with the Company’s existing platforms and service offerings, and expect to take advantage of new synergistic opportunities
as they arise. During the quarter ended January 31, 2023,the Company participated in the Digital Horizon demonstration for the U.S. Navy
in Bahrain which has led to additional opportunities to cross sell our autonomous vehicles. In addition, we plan to integrate the MDAS
platform onto the WAM-V® to expand our MDA offering to provide a roaming MDA solution to our customers.
Power
as a Service
PaaS
solutions deliver value to customers by utilizing our managed power platforms. We continue to develop and commercialize our
proprietary power platforms that generate electricity primarily by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves for our PB3 and
solar power for our hybrid PowerBuoy® (the “hybrid PB”), and have the option of adding small wind turbines to
supplement power generation. We also continue to commercialize our subsea battery for subsea power applications and as additional
storage when combined with our buoy platforms. Our focus for these solutions is on bringing autonomous clean power to our customers
wherever it is required. Moreover, offshore data and communications networks require power to function, and our solution solves for
this need without requiring ongoing battery replacement or older technologies such as shore to station power cables. Many of the
lessons learned from the deployments of both our PB3, including with Enel Green Power Chile, LTDA (“EGP”) for which we
received final acceptance during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and hybrid PB are being used to develop the next generation of
PowerBuoy® systems that is based on modularity for Wave Energy Converter (“WEC”) and non-WEC applications. The PB3
and hybrid PB will continue to be available and supported.
26
Table of Contents
PB3
PowerBuoy ®
The
PB3 uses proprietary technologies that convert the hydrokinetic energy of ocean waves into electricity. The PB3 features a unique onboard
power take-off (“PTO”) system, which incorporates both energy storage and energy management and control systems. The PB3
generates a nominal nameplate capacity rating of up to 3 kilowatts (“kW”) of peak power. Power generation is deployment-site
dependent, as wave activity impacts power generation. Our energy storage system (“ESS”) has a capacity of up to a nominal
150 kW-hours to meet specific application requirements.
The
PB3 is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in offshore locations. The hull consists of a main spar structure
compliantly moored to the seabed and surrounded by a floating annular structure that can freely move up and down in response to the passage
of the waves. The PTO system includes a mechanical energy conversion system, an electrical generator, a power electronics system, our
control system, and our ESS which is sealed within the hull. As ocean waves pass the PB3, the mechanical stroke action created by the
rising and falling of the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the PTO, which in turn, drives the electric generator.
The power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is stored within the ESS.
The
operation of the PB3 is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system. The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer
to continuously monitor the PB3 subsystems. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the PB3
is a significant advantage of our technology. In the event of large storm waves, the control system automatically locks the PB3, and
electricity generation is suspended. However, the load center (either the on-board payload or one in the vicinity of the PB3) may continue
to receive power from the ESS. When wave heights return to normal operating conditions, the control system automatically unlocks the
PB3 and electricity generation and ESS replenishment recommences. This safety feature helps to protect the PB3 from being damaged by
storms.
Customized
solutions are also available for the PB3 including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures, tsunami activity,
and water quality.
hybrid
PowerBuoy®
The
hybrid PB is an alternative platform to the PB3, and utilizes solar and wind power to supplement its propane engine, and providing reliable
power in remote offshore locations, regardless of ocean wave conditions. We believe this product addresses a broader spectrum of customer
deployment needs, including low-wave and nearshore environments, with the potential for greater product integration within each customer
project. The hybrid PB is intended to provide a stable energy platform for our MDAS solution, and for agile deployment of subsea power
applications, such as a surface communications hub for electric remotely operated vehicles (“eROV”) and autonomous underwater
vehicles (“AUV”) used for underwater inspections and short-term maintenance, and subsea equipment monitoring and control.
The design has a high payload capacity for surveillance and communications equipment, with the capability of being tethered to subsea
payloads such as batteries, or with a conventional anchor mooring system. Energy is stored in onboard lithium ion batteries which can
power subsea and topside payloads. The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the hybrid PB subsystems.
The hybrid PB is designed to be able to operate over a broad range of temperature and ocean wave conditions. It has a 30kW-hour battery
system and carries up to 1.2MW-hour energy when combined with the current onboard propane storage system.
Subsea
Battery
Our
subsea battery is complementary to both the PB3 and hybrid PB products and can be deployed together with our PowerBuoys® or as a
standalone unit. It offers customers the option of placing additional modular and expandable energy storage on the seabed near existing,
or to be installed, subsea equipment. Our pressure-tested lithium-iron phosphate subsea batteries supply power that can enable subsea
equipment, sensors, communications and AUV and eROV recharge. Our PB3 and hybrid PB are complementary to the subsea batteries by providing
a means for recharging during longer term deployments, or the batteries can be used independently for shorter term deployments.
The
subsea battery provides both long or short-term power supply from its integrated energy storage system, enabling us to supply into a
range of industries and applications, from backup power to critical subsea infrastructure to continuous operation of subsea equipment,
such as electric valves. The base design of the subsea battery has a nominal 100kW-hours of available energy storage and is designed
to operate in water depths of up to 500 meters. It comes installed on a readily deployable subsea skid suitable for installation on the
seabed. The subsea battery can be integrated into other subsea equipment on land prior to deployment.

focus of our Strategic Consulting Services is on delivering value to our customers in the areas of ocean engineering, structural and
dynamic analysis, Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) studies, and motion simulation. These services can be integrated
in support of our broader PaaS and/or DaaS solutions, utilizing our products or on an independent basis for third party clients. In the
near term, we will focus on increasing our market share in the offshore wind market, the broader floating foundation design market, as
well as with our offshore energy customers.
We
intend to continue to grow our service sectors and strengthen our solutions through internal developments, partnerships, and potential
acquisitions. Our Strategic Consulting Services were materially expanded with the acquisition of 3dent Technology, LLC (“3Dent”),
in February 2021. Our team of dedicated consultants/designers has expertise in structural engineering, hydrodynamics and naval architecture.
Consulting services include simulation engineering, developing purpose specific software, concept design and motion analysis. We also
offer a full range of high-level offshore engineering to offshore wind developers, offshore construction companies, drilling contractors,
major oil companies, service companies, shipyards, and engineering firms. For example, we advise offshore drill rig owners, including
owners of floaters, jackups, and lift boats. The Company has seen an increase in consulting services activity for conventional offshore
energy and for offshore wind projects over the last year.
Strategy
and Marketing
Our
strategy includes developing integrated solutions and services, including autonomous and cloud-based delivery systems for ocean data
and predictive analytics to provide actionable intelligence for our clients. We believe that having demonstrated the capability of our
solutions, we can advance our product and services and gain further adoption from our target markets. Our marketing efforts are focused
on offshore locations that require a cost-efficient solution for renewable, reliable, and persistent power, data collection, and communications,
either by supplying electric power to payloads that are integrated directly with our products or located in its vicinity, such as on
the surface, the seabed, or in the water column. Our recent projects have been in the offshore energy, military and government, and science
and research industries.
Based
on recent market analysis, several emerging themes are shaping the offshore maritime domain awareness sector for commercial and
defense applications, as highlighted by the National Plan to achieve MDA released by the Department of Homeland Security
(“DHS”) and the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) in their ‘Uncrewed Maritime Systems’
2022 report on Maritime Security. Large defense contractors are expanding into the “ocean data collection” space by
acquiring small and mid-size unmanned and autonomous surface and subsea vehicle companies. Uncrewed systems are increasingly in
demand by defense and security and commercial companies to reduce costs and improve safety in offshore operations. Also,
geopolitical developments such as the need for countries to protect their exclusive economic zones from illegal fishing activities
and protect natural resources on the seabed are accelerating the adoption of solutions or technologies that collect, transmit, and
synthesize data to provide actionable intelligence and decision-advantage to clients. For example, in its ‘Technology Outlook
2030’, Det Norske Veritas, Inc, (“DNV”), a leading operator of quality assurance and risk management in maritime,
oil and gas and the energy industries, observed that all-electric systems are gaining popularity in subsea applications due to their
cost-efficiency and reduced environmental impact. DNV predicts that all-electric subsea systems will play a critical role in the
industry’s transition to a more sustainable future. These trends reinforce the increasing need for products, solutions, and
services in the offshore maritime domain awareness sector, particularly for uncrewed and sentinel systems that can improve safety
and reduce costs.
We
serve a diverse range of leading customers in this sector, including defense and security organizations, offshore wind, science and research,
ports and harbors, and oil & gas companies. Our pipeline continues to grow with a healthy mix of defense and security and commercial
opportunities, as we witness growing interest from offshore wind companies for autonomous monitoring, surveillance and survey-related
services during various stages of the project development cycle. Additionally, we are also attracting interest targeted toward subsea
applications, using proprietary sensor payloads for environmental monitoring and subsea intelligence. Our buoys and WAM-Vs® are uniquely
able to deliver these services either as a standalone solution or in combination with other systems. Furthermore, we are becoming a reliable
player in the hydrography survey market, particularly in the shallow water environment.

Commercial
Activities
We
continue to seek new strategic relationships and further develop our existing partnerships. We collaborate with companies that have developed
or are developing in-ocean applications requiring a persistent source of power that is also capable of real time data collection, processing
and communication, to address potential customer needs. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had two and
four customers whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues, respectively. These revenues accounted
for approximately 28% and 58% of the Company’s total revenue for the respective periods. For the three months ended January 31,
2023 and 2022, the Company had five and four customers whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated
revenues, respectively. These revenues accounted for approximately 63% and 71% of the Company’s total revenue for the respective
periods.
In
order to achieve success in ongoing efforts to commercialize our products, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts
to lease or sell our solutions and services to customers. Our potential customer base for our solutions includes various public and private
entities, and agencies that require remote offshore power.

Business
Relationships
We
believe that our solutions are best developed, sold, deployed, and maintained together with subject matter experts in their respective
fields. This enables the Company to protect, maintain, and evolve our various platforms and integrate them with surface and subsea payloads.
The Company has previously entered into business relationships focused on including, but not limited to, deployment and installations,
sourcing of surface payloads, and integration with autonomous vehicles. To augment the further development the MDAS, we maintain ongoing
strategic software and robotics partnerships with two software companies, Greensea Systems, Inc. and Fathom5. We believe the business
relationships with Greensea and Fathom5 will further the development, alongside our internal technology resources, of our next-generation
MDAS product for the maritime industrial market and governmental defense and security organizations.
Greensea
Systems, Inc. is contributing to the Company’s MDAS by providing integration software, control software, autonomy and systems integration
for the buoy sensor payload.
Fathom5
designed and is building a customized data platform that supports the Company’s MDAS with sensor data feed management, secure communications
management, a cloud-based infrastructure, and web-based user interface. The platform was designed with a flexible architecture that allows
the Company to integrate new sensor technologies and third-party analytics capabilities and share MDAS data with customers and partners.
We
also maintain an active dialogue with several offshore specialist and marine operations partners in the North Sea and North America to
support our deployment, maintenance, and recovery operations and projects.
Business
Strategy
During
fiscal 2023, we continue to advance our marketing programs, products, and solutions. We have made progress in transitioning from an R&D
focused organization to more robust commercialization efforts and we are moving further into the ocean DaaS market. We intend to build
on these efforts by introducing additional processes and making investments in appropriate human capital to more effectively target potential
customers from demand generation to close of contract. In addition, we are focusing on customer care and service efforts to increase
repeat business opportunities. This strategy was further enhanced by our acquisition of MAR in November 2021.
The
majority of the Company’s potential customers are in areas of defense and security, hydrographic survey, offshore and coastal communication
networks, and maritime domain awareness, including mitigation of IUU fishing. These are largely for customers in the United States, where
the end use may be both domestic or abroad. Further, the Company’s acquisition of MAR provides an unmanned surface vehicle platform
for use in oil & gas, renewable energy, hydrographic survey, and security and defense markets largely in North America and Europe.

Historically,
demonstration projects have been a requisite step towards broad solution deployment and revenues associated with specific applications
such as our New Jersey MDAS test array as part of our DaaS solution and to highlight these capabilities. Customers may want their own
dedicated demonstration depending on customer needs. During a typical demonstration project’s specification, negotiation and evaluation
period, we are often subject to the prospective customer’s vendor qualification process, which entails substantial due diligence
of the Company and its capabilities. Such demonstrations are often a required step prior to leasing and may include negotiation of standard
terms and conditions. Many proposals contain provisions which would provide the option to purchase or lease our PowerBuoy® or WAM-V®
product upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project. The Company has successfully demonstrated the capabilities of many of
its solutions on its own or in customer-sponsored evaluation projects and remains focused on further demonstrations to build customer
awareness and confidence and to drive revenue.
The
Company is pursuing a long-term growth strategy to expand its market value proposition while growing the Company’s revenue base.
This strategy includes partnerships with leading companies and organizations in adjacent and complementary markets. We continue to develop
our PowerBuoy® and WAM-V® products for use in offshore power, data acquisition, and real-time data communications applications,
and in order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives:
● Integrated
turn-key solutions, purchases or leases. We believe our DaaS and PaaS solutions, together
with our platforms, are well suited to enable unmanned, autonomous (non-grid connected) offshore
applications, such as topside and subsea surveillance and communications, subsea equipment
monitoring, early warning systems platform, subsea power and buffering, and weather and climate
data collection. We have investigated and realized market demand for some of these solutions
and we intend to sell and/or lease our products to these markets as part of these broader
integrated solutions. Additionally, we intend to provide services associated with our solution
offerings such as paid engineering studies, value-added engineering, maintenance, remote
monitoring and diagnostics, application engineering, planning, training, project management,
and marine and logistics support required for our solution life cycle. We continue to increase
our commercial capabilities through new hires in sales, engineering, product development,
safety, and application support, and through engagement of expert market consultants in various
geographies. As our MDAS development continues, we expect that this will also include data
and cloud services.
● Expand
customer system solution offerings through new complementary products that enable more cost-efficient
deployments that make shorter missions more feasible. We are continuously innovating new
solutions to deliver enhanced value to our customers, such as enhancing our MDAS and improving
our deployment platforms solutions, such as our PowerBuoys® and WAM-Vs®. We are currently
developing our next generation Power Buoy that incorporates wave, wind, and solar power generation
capabilities in a robust yet cost effective system that supports shorter term missions as
well as the ability to operate in near shore and low wave environments. This effort is partially
funded by the DOE SBIR Phase II award. In addition, we have future plans to integrate PB3
and WAM-V® capabilities, including the possibility of adding recharging capabilities
to our PowerBuoys, and MDAS capabilities to include our WAM-Vs®, thus extending our reach
and providing both fixed and mobile MDAS offerings to our customers.
The
Company has a subsea battery system available to commercial clients that is complementary to the Company’s PowerBuoy® products.
The subsea battery system offers the ability to create a seafloor energy storage solution for remote offshore operations. These subsea
battery systems contain lithium-iron phosphate batteries, which provide high power density to supply power to subsea equipment, sensors,
communications, and the recharging of AUVs and eROVs. Ideal for many remote offshore customer applications, these subsea battery systems
are designed to be safe, high performance, cost-efficient, and quickly deployable. The Company’s PowerBuoy® products can also be used with other providers’ battery systems .

Table of Contents
Our
WAM-Vs® are easily and economically shipped via land, air, or sea, and their modular design enables us to quickly reduce their size
for storage or shipment. The ability to disassemble a WAM-V® reduces the footprint by as much as 75%, and as a result, a 20-foot
container can hold four 16-foot WAM-Vs®. To integrate our solutions and add roaming as an option or enhancement to our MDAS, we are
advancing developments to further integrate MDAS into the WAM-V® platform and develop additional autonomy capabilities.
● Focus
sales efforts in key global markets in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia and Australia. While
we are marketing our products and services globally, we have focused on several key markets
and applications, including U.S. and foreign defense and security applications with our MDAS
offering; subsea power for oil and gas; and the hydrographic survey market with regard to
our WAM-Vs®. We believe that each of these areas has demand for our solutions, sizable
end market opportunities, and high levels of industrialization and economic development.
We have an office in Houston, Texas that enables us to further support our customers and
strengthen our dialogue with our solution partners. During fiscal 2022, we added an office
in Richmond, California through our acquisition of MAR. During fiscal 2022, we also further
streamlined our global operation by selecting to work with partners in active offshore markets,
such as the North Sea. These relationships continue to be evaluated against performance criteria
during fiscal 2023. We are in active discussions with potential partners in North and South
America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and West Africa.
● Expand
our relationships in key market areas through strategic partnerships and collaborations.
We believe that strategic partners are an important part of expanding visibility to our products.
Partnerships and collaborations can be used to improve the development of overall integrated
solutions, create new market channels, expand commercial know-how and geographic footprint,
and bolster our product delivery capabilities. We have formed such a relationship with several
well-known groups, and we continue to seek other opportunities to collaborate with application
experts from within our selected markets. These partnerships have helped us source services,
such as installation expertise, and products, such as MDA enabling equipment, to meet our
development and customer obligations. We have been actively pursuing additional opportunities
to bring in-house skills, capabilities, and solutions that are complementary to our strategy
and enable us to scale more quickly, including, for example, our acquisition of 3Dent and
MAR.
● Partner
with fabrication, deployment and service support. In order to minimize our capital requirements
as we scale our business, we intend to optimize and utilize state of the art fabrication,
anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and in some cases, deployment of our products and solutions.
We believe this domestically distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to
focus on our core competencies and ensure a cost-effective product by leveraging a larger
more established supply base. We continue to seek strategic partnerships regarding servicing
of our products and solutions.
● Survey
and security market applications. With the addition of our WAM-V® products, we are able
to increase our ability to lease vehicles specifically to support shoreline and offshore
survey markets as well as security applications while integrating MDA into these solutions.

Liquidity
During
the nine months ending January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $16.8 million and used cash in operations
of approximately $16.1 million. The Company has continued to make investments in ongoing product development efforts and in building
inventory in anticipation of, and in support of, future growth. The Company’s future results of operations involve significant
risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company’s future operating results and could cause actual results to
vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, performance of its products, its ability to market and
commercialize its products and new products that it may develop, technology development, scalability of technology and production,
ability to attract and retain key personnel, concentration of customers and suppliers, and deployment risks and integration of
acquisitions.
The Company previously obtained equity financing through
its At the Market Offering Agreement (“ATM”) with A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) and through its
equity line financing with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (“Aspire Capital”), but the Company cannot be certain that
additional equity and/or debt financing will be available to the Company as needed on acceptable terms, or at all.
Management
believes the Company’s cash balance of $11.0 million and short term investments balance of $30.0 million at January 31, 2023 is
sufficient to fund its planned operations through at least March 2024.
Capital
Raises
At
the Market Offering Agreement:
On November 20, 2020, the Company entered into an At-the-Market Offering Agreement with AGP (the “2020
ATM Facility”) pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of the Company’s common stock
having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. The Company’s common stock will be sold at prevailing market prices
at the time of sale, and, as a result, prices will vary. Although the Company initially only had filed to sell up to $50.0 million, a
prospectus supplement was filed on January 10, 2022 to allow the Company to sell an additional $25.0 million of common stock up to a
total of $75.0 million under the 2020 ATM Facility. As of January 31, 2023, an aggregate of $50.0 million remained available under this
facility, subject to the filing of a prospectus supplement for an additional $25.0 million.
Equity
Line Common Stock Purchase Agreement:
On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire
Capital which provided that, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations, Aspire Capital was committed to purchase up to an
aggregate of $12.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock over a 30-month period subject to a limit of 19.99% of the outstanding
common stock on the date of the agreement if the price did not exceed a specified price in the agreement. The number of shares the Company
could issue within the 19.99% limit was 3,722,251 shares without shareholder approval. Shareholder approval was received at the Company’s
annual meeting of shareholders on December 23, 2020 for the sale of 9,864,706 additional shares of common stock which exceeded the 19.99%
limit of the outstanding common stock on the date of the agreement. Through January 31, 2023, the Company had sold an aggregate of 3,722,251
shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of $11.8 million at an average price of $3.17 per share pursuant to this common
stock purchase agreement with approximately $0.7 million remaining on the facility as of January 31, 2023.
The
sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. If additional funds are raised through
the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock; these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock
and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. The Company has obtained equity financing through its ATM Agreement with
AGP and the Aspire Capital financing, but the Company cannot be certain that additional equity and/or debt financing will be available
to the Company as needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain required financing when needed, we may be required
to reduce the scope of our operations, including our planned product development and marketing efforts, which could materially and adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we may be forced to cease our
operations.
Backlog
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company’s backlog was $2.5 million. Our backlog includes unfilled firm orders for our products and services
from commercial or governmental customers. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected
value of the remaining terms of such contract.
The
amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts
and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A portion of our revenue is recognized using the
input method used to measure progress towards completion of our customer contracts over time, and changes in estimates from time to time
may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due
to the timing of new awards.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
To
understand our financial statements, it is important to understand our critical accounting policies and estimates. We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements
also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related
disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences
between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance,
as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
For
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the section entitled Item 7.- “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. There were
no material changes to our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies during the nine months ended January 31, 2023.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, “ Financial Instruments
-
Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”
This amendment replaces the incurred
loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses on instruments within its scope,
including trade receivables. This update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about
the expected credit losses. In November 2019, the FASB issued No. 2019-10,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326),
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for Smaller Reporting
Companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Financial
Operations Overview
The
following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results.
Revenues
A
performance obligation is the unit of account for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC
606) or Accounting Standards Codification 842 (ASC 842) which identifies how to recognize revenue in leasing arrangement. For
revenue recognized under ASC 606, The Company assesses the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identifies
as a performance obligation as either: a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or b) a series of
distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. A contract
may contain a single or multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates
the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents
the price the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the standalone selling
price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. When no observable standalone selling price is
available, the standalone selling price is generally estimated based upon the Company’s forecast of the total cost to satisfy the
performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.
34
Table of Contents
The
nature of the Company’s contracts may give rise to several types of variable considerations, including unpriced change orders and
liquidated damages and penalties. Variable considerations can also arise from modifications to the scope of services. Variable consideration
is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not
occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination
of whether to include such amounts in the transaction price are based largely on our assessment of legal enforceability, performance
and any other information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. There was no variable consideration
related to open contracts as of January 31, 2023 and 2022.
The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer, either (1)
at a point in time or (2) over time. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of it. The evaluation of
whether control of each performance obligation is transferred at a point in time or over time is made at contract inception. Input measures
such as costs incurred or time elapsed are utilized to assess progress against specific contractual performance obligations for the Company’s
services. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services
to be provided. For the Company, the input method using costs or labor hour incurred best represents the measure of progress against
the performance obligations incorporated within the contractual agreements. When the Company’s estimate of total costs to be incurred
to satisfy the performance obligations exceeds revenues, the Company recognizes the loss immediately.
The
Company’s contracts are either cost plus or fixed price contracts. Under cost plus contracts, customers are billed for actual expenses
incurred plus an agreed-upon fee. Under cost plus contracts, a profit or loss on a project is recognized depending on whether actual
costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount.
The
Company has two types of fixed price contracts, firm fixed price and cost-sharing. Under firm fixed price contracts, the Company receives
an agreed-upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract, a profit or loss is recognized depending on whether
actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount. Under cost-sharing contracts, the fixed amount agreed upon with the customer
is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project. Under cost sharing contracts, an amount corresponding to the revenue
is recorded in cost of revenues, resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero. The Company’s share of the costs is recorded
as product development expense. The Company reports its disaggregation of revenues by contract type since this method best represents
the Company’s business. For the nine-month periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company’s contracts were classified
as firm fixed price.
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company’s total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $2.5 million.
The Company expects to recognize approximately 85%, or $2.1 million, of the remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next
twelve months.
The
Company also enters into lease arrangements for its PB3 and WAM-V® with certain customers. Revenue related to multiple-element arrangements
is allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative standalone selling prices or expected cost plus a margin approach.
Lease elements generally include a PB3 or WAM-V® and components, while non-lease elements generally include engineering, monitoring
and support services. In the lease arrangement, the customer may be provided an option to extend the lease term or purchase the leased
asset at some point during and/or at the end of the lease term.
The
Company classifies leases as either operating or financing in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance contained within
ASC Topic 842,
“Leases”.
At inception of the contract, the Company evaluates the lease against the lease classification
criteria within ASC Topic 842. If the direct financing or sales-type classification criteria are met, then the lease is accounted for
as a finance lease. All others are treated as an operating lease, either under the right of use classification or short-term operating
lease.
The
Company recognizes revenue from operating lease arrangements generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on time or
usage as presented in Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The lease income for the three months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022 was $175,000 and zero, respectively.

data monitoring and controls systems, and to the development of new products, product applications and complementary technologies. We
expense all of our product development costs including engineering product development costs as incurred.
Selling,
general and administrative costs
Our
selling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of professional fees, salaries and other personnel-related costs for employees
and consultants engaged in sales and marketing and support of our products, and costs for executive, accounting and administrative personnel,
professional fees and other general corporate expenses.
Interest
income, net

Foreign
exchange gain (loss)
We
transact business in various countries and have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange gains and
losses arise in the translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities, which may result in realized and unrealized gains or losses
from exchange rate fluctuations. Since we conduct our business in U.S. dollars and our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, our main
foreign exchange exposure, if any, results from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling,
and the Euro.
We
maintain cash accounts that are denominated in British pounds sterling in addition to U.S. dollars. These foreign-denominated accounts
had an aggregate balance of $14,000 as of January 31, 2023 and $28,000 as of April 30, 2022, compared to our total cash, cash equivalents,
short term investments, and restricted cash balances of $41.1 million as of January 31, 2023 and $57.7 million as of April 30, 2022.
In
addition, a portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries in countries other than the U.S., and specifically Ocean
Power Technologies Ltd. in the United Kingdom, the functional currency of which is the British pound sterling. This subsidiary has foreign
exchange exposure that results from changes in the exchange rate between their functional currency and other foreign currencies in which
they conduct business. The Company is in the process of winding down its Australian subsidiary, which is expected to be completed during
fiscal 2023. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from foreign currency balances translation are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss within Shareholders’ Equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized within our Consolidated Statements
of Operations.
We
currently do not hedge our exchange rate exposure. However, we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements and
capital asset acquisitions of our foreign operations and attempt to maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents denominated in
foreign currencies sufficient to satisfy these anticipated requirements. We also assess the need and cost to utilize financial instruments
to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis and may hedge against exchange rate exposure in the future.

Revenues
Revenues
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to higher levels of revenue stemming from MAR which increased revenue by $0.2 million for the three month ended January
31, 2023.
Cost
of revenues
Cost
of revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The lack of movement
despite the increase in revenue is related to better margins on our strategic consulting services and government related grants with
NOAA and DOE in the current year.
Change
in fair value of contingent consideration
The
change in fair value of contingent consideration for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $0.4 million relating to an adjustment
of the contingent consideration liability based on actual and forecasted revenues relating to the MAR acquisition. The previous year
related to an adjustment to a 3Dent earnout liability in relation to their acquisition.
Operating
expenses
Operating
expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $6.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The increase of approximately
$1.4 million was the result of an increase in employee related costs of $1.0 million due to increased headcount, an increase in product
development costs of $0.3 million, and an increase in office related expenses of $0.1 million from the prior year.

Interest
income
Interest
income for three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.2 million and $16,000, respectively. The increase was directly

investments held for the three months ended January 31, 2022.
Other
income
Other
income for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.5 million and zero, respectively. The amount in the current year relates

Revenues
Revenues
for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to higher levels of revenue stemming from the acquisition of MAR which produced $0.9 million in revenue as of January 31,
2023. The MAR acquisition took place in November 2021 with $0.2 million in revenue as of the nine months ended January 31, 2022.
Cost
of revenues
Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The increase of
approximately $0.1 million over fiscal year 2022 was mostly due to the acquisition of MAR and their related projects for the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 which were part of the Company for only three of the nine months ended January 31, 2022.

Change
in fair value of contingent consideration
The
change in fair value of contingent consideration for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was $0.2 million relating to an adjustment
of the contingent consideration liability based on actual and forecasted revenues relating to the MAR acquisition. The previous year
related to an adjustment to a 3Dent earnout liability in relation to their acquisition.
Operating
expenses
Operating
expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $19.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively. The increase of approximately
$4.0 million was the result of an increase in employee related costs of $1.9 million due to increased headcount and the inclusion
of MAR employees for nine months in the current year and only 2 months in the prior year, an increase in product development related costs of $1.6 million, an increase in office related expenses of $0.3 million and an increase in corporate costs of $0.2 million
from the prior year.
Interest
Income
Interest
income for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The increase was directly
related to the short term investments we made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. As such, there were no short term investments held for the nine months ended January 31, 2022.
Extinguishment
of Debt
The
Company filed its loan forgiveness application for the PPP loan at the end of February 2021 asking for 100% forgiveness of the loan.
In June 2021, the Company was informed that its application was approved, the loan was fully forgiven and the Company recognized a gain
on extinguishment of PPP loan of $0.9 million in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended January 31, 2022.
Other
income
Other
income for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2021 was $1.7 million and zero, respectively. The amount in the current year relates
to employee retention credits applied for previously filed payroll tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service of $1.2 million and
proceeds received for an insurance claim of $0.5 million.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Our
cash requirements relate primarily to working capital needed to operate and grow our business including funding operating expenses. We
have experienced and continue to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses of $16.8
million and $13.7 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to “Liquidity Outlook”
below for additional information.
Net
cash used in operating activities
During
the nine months ended January 31, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was $16.1 million, an increase of $0.3 million compared
to net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2022 of $15.8 million. This reflects an increase in
net loss of $3.1 million and an increase in inventory of $ 0.8 million, primarily offset by a gain on extinguishment of the PPP loan
of $0.9 million, an increase in contract liabilities of $1.2 million the payment of litigation payable in the prior year of $1.2 million.
Net
cash provided by (used in) investing activities
Net
cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was $18.9 million, compared to $3.9 million cash
used in investing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities
was primarily due to the redemption of short term investments of $49.6 million, partially offset by the purchase of short term investments
of $30.4 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023.

Table of Contents
Net
cash (used in) provided by financing activities
Net
cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 of $14,000 relates to the acquisition of treasury
stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2022 of $90,000 relates to the number of stock option exercises in the prior year while no options were exercised in the current year.
Effect
of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents
There
was no effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and there was a decrease
of approximately $14,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents
stems primarily from gains or losses on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries and foreign denominated cash and cash
equivalents.
Liquidity
Outlook
Since
our inception, the cash flows from customer revenues have not been sufficient to fund our operations and provide the capital
resources for our business. As of January 31, 2023, our aggregate year to date revenues were $1.8 million, our aggregate year to
date net losses were $16.8 million, our year to date net cash used in operating activities was $16.1 million and our accumulated
deficit was $270.6 million.
We
expect to devote substantial resources to continue our development efforts for our products and to expand our sales, marketing and manufacturing
programs associated with the continued commercialization of our products. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of
factors, including but not limited to:
● our
ability to develop, market and commercialize our products, and achieve and sustain profitability;
● our
continued development of our proprietary technologies, and expected continued use of cash
from operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization
of our products and services;
● our
ability to obtain additional funding, as and if needed, which will be subject to several
factors, including market conditions, and our operating performance;
● the
continued impact of COVID-19 and the inflation related to the U.S. dollar on our business,
operations, customers, suppliers and manufacturers and personnel;
● our
ability to meet product development, manufacturing and customer delivery deadlines may be
impacted by disruptions to our supply chain, primarily related to labor shortages and manufacturing
and transportation delays both here in the U.S. and abroad;
● our
acquisitions and our ability to integrate them into our operations may use significant resources,
be unsuccessful or expose us to unforeseen liabilities;
● our
estimates regarding future expenses, revenues, and capital requirements;
● our
ability to identify and penetrate markets for our products, services, and solutions;
● our
ability to effectively respond to competition in our targeted markets
● our
ability to establish relationships with our existing and future strategic partners may not
be successful;
41
Table of Contents
● our
ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American;
● the
reliability of our technology, products and solutions;
● our
ability to improve the power output and survivability of our products;
● changes
in current legislation, regulations and economic conditions that affect the demand for, or
restrict the use of our products;
● our
ability to hire and retain key personnel, including senior management, to achieve our business
objectives;
● our
history of operating losses, which we expect to continue for at least the short term and
possibly longer; and
● our
ability to protect our intellectual property portfolio.
Our
business is capital intensive, and through January 31, 2023, we have been funding our business principally through sales of our securities.
As of January 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments balance was $41.1 million and we expect
to fund our business with this amount and, to a lesser extent, with our profits. Management believes the Company’s current cash
and cash equivalents, and short term investments, are sufficient to fund its planned expenditures through at least March 2024.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
Since
inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing activities.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023 pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of January 31, 2023 to ensure that non-financial statement and related disclosure information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred
during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
As
part of our normal business activities, we are party to a number of legal proceedings and other matters in various stages of development.
Management periodically assesses our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information
available. We disclose material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as we may determine to be appropriate.
For
information on matters in dispute, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS
The
discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 and set forth below in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risk factors describe various
risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. Except as noted below,
there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
July 13, 2022.
We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability and positive cash flow.
We
have incurred net losses since we began operations in 1994, including net losses of $16.8 million during the first nine months of
fiscal year 2023 and $13.7 million during the same nine month period in fiscal year 2022. As of January 31, 2023, we had an
accumulated deficit of $270.6 million. To date, our activities have consisted primarily of activities related to the development and
testing of our technologies and our PowerBuoy®. Thus, our losses to date have resulted primarily from costs incurred in our
research and development programs and from our selling, general and administrative costs. As we continue to develop our proprietary
technologies, we expect to continue to have a net use of cash from operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash
flow from the commercialization of our products and services.
We
do not know whether we will be able to successfully commercialize our products and solutions, or whether we can achieve profitability.
There is significant uncertainty about our ability to successfully commercialize our products and solutions in our targeted markets.
Even if we do achieve commercialization of our products and solutions and become profitable, we may not be able to achieve or, if achieved,
sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
