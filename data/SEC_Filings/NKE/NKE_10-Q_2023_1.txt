The year-end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data as of May 31, 2022, was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The interim financial information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. The results of operations for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire fiscal year. The uncertain state of the global economy or worsening macroeconomic conditions could affect the Company’s business, including, among other things, higher inventory levels in various markets, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher promotional activity, reduced demand for product, reduced orders from wholesale customers for product and order cancellations. There could also be new or prolonged COVID-19 related restrictions or disruptions. Any of these factors, among others, could have material adverse impacts on the Company’s revenue growth as well as overall profitability in future periods. NOTE 2 — INVENTORIES Inventory balances of $ 9,326
million and $ 8,420
million at November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively, were substantially all finished goods. NOTE 3 — ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accrued liabilities included the following: NOVEMBER 30, MAY 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2022 Compensation and benefits, excluding taxes $ 1,220   $ 1,297   Sales-related reserves 1,149 1,015   Import and logistics costs 580 489   Dividends payable 534 485   Allowance for expected loss on sale (1) — 397   Other 2,537 2,537 TOTAL ACCRUED LIABILITIES $ 6,020   $ 6,220   (1) Refer to Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.
NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities.
For additional information about the Company's fair value policies, refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. 8
Table of Contents The following tables present information about the Company's financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, and indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the Company classifies the fair value measurement: NOVEMBER 30, 2022 (Dollars in millions) ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Cash $ 788   $ 788   $ —  Level 1: U.S. Treasury securities 3,417   4   3,413   Level 2: Commercial paper and bonds 622   29   593   Money market funds 5,024   5,024   —   Time deposits 753   645   108   U.S. Agency securities 17   —   17   Total Level 2 6,416   5,698   718   TOTAL $ 10,621   $ 6,490   $ 4,131   MAY 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Cash $ 839   $ 839   $ —  Level 1: U.S. Treasury securities 3,801   8   3,793   Level 2: Commercial paper and bonds 660   37   623   Money market funds 6,458   6,458   —   Time deposits 1,237   1,232   5   U.S. Agency securities 2   —   2   Total Level 2 8,357   7,727   630   TOTAL $ 12,997   $ 8,574   $ 4,423   As of November 30, 2022, the Company held $ 3,060
million of available-for-sale debt securities with maturity dates within one year and $ 1,071
million with maturity dates greater than one year and less than five years in Short-term investments on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities approximates their amortized cost. Included in
Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's investment portfolio of $ 49
million and $ 18
million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 114

No
amount of collateral was posted on the derivative liability balance as of May 31, 2022. For additional information related to the Company's derivative financial instruments and credit risk, refer to Note 8 — Risk Management and Derivatives.
The carrying amounts of other current financial assets and other current financial liabilities approximate fair value.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE The Company's Long-term debt
is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. The fair value of long-term debt
is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Company's Long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 8,410
million at November 30, 2022 and $ 8,933  million at May 31, 2022. The carrying amounts reflected on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value. NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was
19.5 % and
11.0 % for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the Company's effective tax rate was primarily due to a less favorable impact from stock-based compensation and a shift in the Company's earnings mix. As of November 30, 2022, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $ 867
million, $ 652
million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The majority of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 31, 2022, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $ 848
million. As of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $ 276
million and $ 248
million, respectively, (excluding federal benefit) and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. IRS for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments.
Tax years after 2011 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $ 20
million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase. 10
Table of Contents NOTE 6 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) provides for the issuance of up to
798
million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) as well as performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs). In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount from the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Refer to Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 for further information.
The following table summarizes the Company's total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:    THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Stock options (1) $ 79   $ 81   $ 154   $ 146   ESPPs 18   14   33   29   Restricted stock and restricted stock units (1)(2) 97   75   177   131   TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE $ 194   $ 170   $ 364   $ 306   (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is primarily recorded for employees meeting certain retirement eligibility requirements. (2) Restricted stock units include RSUs and PSUs. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $ 2
million and $ 87  million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 22
million and $ 273  million for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and reported within Income tax expense. STOCK OPTIONS The weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $ 31.31
and $ 37.53 , respectively.
The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values were as follows:   SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2022 2021 Dividend yield 0.9   % 0.8   % Expected volatility 27.1   % 24.9   % Weighted average expected life (in years) 5.8 5.8 Risk-free interest rate 3.3   % 0.9   % Expected volatilities are based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, the implied volatility in market-traded options on the Company's common stock with a term greater than
one year , as well as other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.

As of and for the six months ended November 30, 2022, there have been no material changes to the Company's hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within the Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information about the Company's derivatives and hedging policies refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of November 30, 2022, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar and Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument's maturity date. 12

Effective hedge results are classified in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional
two-month
period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was approximately $ 17.4
billion as of November 30, 2022. Approximately $ 798
million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of November 30, 2022, are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of November 30, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was
30
months.
15 Table of Contents UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract.
The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $ 4.6
billion as of November 30, 2022. EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.
As of November 30, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $ 360
million. CREDIT RISK The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $ 50
million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $ 50
million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of November 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such features were in a net asset position of approximately $ 820
million. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post cash collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, $ 345
million of collateral was received on the Company's derivative asset balance as of November 30, 2022. The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial. For additional information related to the Company's derivative financial instruments and collateral, refer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements. 16

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands.
The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.
Corporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. 21 Table of Contents   THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 REVENUES North America $ 5,830   $ 4,477   $ 11,340   $ 9,356   Europe, Middle East & Africa 3,489   3,142   6,822   6,449   Greater China 1,788   1,844   3,444   3,826   Asia Pacific & Latin America 1,599   1,347   3,134   2,812   Global Brand Divisions 18   6   32   13   Total NIKE Brand 12,724   10,816   24,772   22,456   Converse 586   557   1,229   1,186   Corporate 5   ( 16 ) 1   ( 37 ) TOTAL NIKE, INC.

See Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information. NOTE 12 — CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and actions of its employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, intellectual property and other matters. The outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences relating to those matters. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial position, operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described below. BELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM The Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal 2018. The Company disputes these claims and has engaged in the appellate process. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this matter is ultimately resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the matter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. NOTE 13 — ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay, as well as its entity in Chile, to third-party distributors. The related assets and liabilities of these entities within the Company’s APLA operating segment were classified as held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, until the transactions closed. As of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $ 182
million and held-for-sale liabilities were $ 58
million. The sale of the Company’s entity in Chile to a third-party distributor was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The impacts from the transaction were not material to the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed the sale of its entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor. The net loss on the sale of these entities totaled approximately $ 550
million, $ 389
million of which was recognized by the Company in prior periods and a corresponding allowance within in Accrued liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The previously recognized loss was primarily due to the anticipated release of the cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Upon completion of the sale, these foreign currency translation losses were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Net income within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate, and were largely offset by the release of the valuation allowance recognized within Accrued liabilities. The remaining loss, primarily due to the devaluation of the local currency and cash equivalents included in the transfer of assets, was recognized upon completion of the sale within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash proceeds received, net of cash and cash equivalents transferred, are reflected within Other investing activities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
23 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. Through the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we are focusing on creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners that share our marketplace vision. Over the last several years, as we have executed against the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have grown our NIKE Direct revenues to be approximately 43% and 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, and we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts globally. Additionally, we have aligned our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids’ and continue to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MARKET DYNAMICS Ongoing supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to create volatility in our business results and operations globally.
Our second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 Revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, due to strong demand for our product and more product available to meet this demand compared to the prior fiscal year,
which was impacted by temporary factory closures due to COVID-19 and extended inventory transit times.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, inventory transit times rapidly improved compared to fiscal 2022, and seasonal inventory that was ordered based on the extended transit times, arrived earlier than planned leading to elevated levels of inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023 we made progress on normalizing our inventory levels ,
as Inventories decreased 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023
as a result of strong demand for our product across our wholesale and direct to consumer channels, and increased promotional activity, specifically in apparel in North America.
The marketplace remains promotional, and gross margin for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by high levels of promotional activity to sell excess inventory and create capacity in the marketplace for new seasonally relevant product. We have also adjusted our inventory purchases for the remainder of fiscal 2023 as we continue to prioritize reducing excess inventory in the marketplace across our geographies.
Additionally, gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in net foreign currency exchange rates, elevated freight and logistics costs as well as higher product input costs, including materials and labor. Strategic pricing increases partially offset the negative impacts on gross margin for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 which decreased 300 basis points and 260 basis points, respectively.
Most of our geographies are currently operating with little to no COVID-19 related disruptions. In Greater China however, we continue to experience a higher level of store closures and reduced traffic in our retail stores due to COVID-19 related disruptions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we managed through a higher number of temporary store closures in Greater China primarily due to local government restrictions. Although these restrictions were lifted In December 2022, we expect the operating environment will remain volatile which could continue to cause disruptions to our operations. We expect net unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, will have a material negative impact on reported Revenues, gross margin and Income before income taxes for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Additionally, we expect the continued combination of elevated freight and logistics costs, increased product input costs and increased promotional activity, partially offset by strategic pricing increases, will have a negative impact on gross margin for the remainder of the fiscal year. 24
Table of Contents We also continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including consumer behavior and the potential impacts inflation could have on consumer demand for our product. While we believe our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy continues to drive our business toward our long-term financial goals, worsening macroeconomic conditions could affect our business, including, among other things, higher inventory levels in various markets, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher promotional activity, reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from our wholesale customers for our products and order cancellations. There could also be new or prolonged COVID-19 related restrictions or disruptions across our geographies. Any of these factors, among others, could have material adverse impacts on our revenue growth as well as overall profitability in future periods. SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 17% to $13.3 billion compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and increased 27% on a currency-neutral basis. Net income was $1,331 million and diluted earnings per common share was $0.85 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to Net income of $1,337 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.83 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Income before income taxes increased 10% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to higher revenues, partially offset by gross margin contraction and higher Selling and administrative expense. NIKE Brand revenues, which represent over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 18% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues increased 28%, driven by higher revenues across all geographies, led by increases in North America and EMEA. Additionally, NIKE Brand currency-neutral revenues were higher across footwear and apparel, as well as Men's, the Jordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Revenues for Converse increased 5% and 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by strong performance in North America, licensee markets and Western Europe, partially offset by declines in Asia. Our effective tax rate was 19.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to 10.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation and a shift in our earnings mix.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a fifteen percent minimum tax based on "adjusted financial statement income," which is effective for NIKE beginning June 1, 2023, and a one percent excise tax on net repurchases of stock after December 31, 2022. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, we do not expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third party distributor. For more information see Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Now that we have completed the shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model within our Central and South America (CASA) territory to a distributor model, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to different commercial terms. However, over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT and EBIT Margin, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. EBIT Margin is calculated as EBIT divided by total NIKE, Inc. Revenues. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, EBIT and EBIT margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 % CHANGE 2022 2021 % CHANGE Revenues $ 13,315  $ 11,357  17  % $ 26,002  $ 23,605  10  % Cost of sales 7,604  6,144  24  % 14,676  12,696  16  % Gross profit 5,711  5,213  10  % 11,326  10,909  4  % Gross margin 42.9  % 45.9  % 43.6  % 46.2  % Demand creation expense 1,102  1,017  8  % 2,045  1,935  6  % Operating overhead expense 3,022  2,742  10  % 5,999  5,396  11  % Total selling and administrative expense 4,124  3,759  10  % 8,044  7,331  10  % % of revenues 31.0  % 33.1  % 30.9  % 31.1  % Interest expense (income), net 16  55  —  29  112  —  Other (income) expense, net (79) (102) —  (225) (141) —  Income before income taxes 1,650  1,501  10  % 3,478  3,607  -4  % Income tax expense 319  164  95  % 679  396  71  % Effective tax rate 19.3  % 10.9  % 19.5  % 11.0  % NET INCOME $ 1,331   $ 1,337   0   % $ 2,799   $ 3,211   -13   % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.85  $ 0.83  2  % $ 1.77  $ 1.98  -11  % CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS REVENUES THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) 2022 2021 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) NIKE, Inc.

Table of Contents SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 27% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by higher revenues in both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Higher revenues in North America, EMEA and APLA contributed approximately 12, 9 and 4 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with Greater China and Converse each contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 36% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand and Women's. Unit sales of footwear increased 28%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, increased 14%, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 10%, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.
NIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 19% and 30% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily due to increased product availability to meet demand. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 43% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for both the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the second quarter of fiscal 2022. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $3.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $2.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 25%, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 34%, comparable store sales growth of 11% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 18% for the first six months of fiscal 2023, driven by higher revenues in North America, EMEA and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in North America, EMEA and APLA contributed approximately 9, 7 and 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, respectively, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 23%, driven by growth in Men's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 14%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 9 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher NIKE Direct ASP. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 10%, driven by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 7% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. NIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 9% and 18% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily due to increased product availability to meet demand. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2023 and the first six months of fiscal 2022. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $6.3 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $5.2 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2022.

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 Demand creation expense increased 8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Demand creation expense by approximately 7 percentage points. Operating overhead expense increased 10% primarily due to higher wage-related expenses, higher strategic technology investments and higher NIKE Direct costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Operating overhead expense by approximately 5 percentage points. 28

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Other (income) expense, net $ (79) $ (102) $ (225) $ (141) Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Other (income) expense, net decreased from $102 million of other income to $79 million in the current year, largely due to the loss recognized upon the completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor, partially offset by a favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, Other (income) expense, net increased from $141 million of other income to $225 million in the current year, primarily due to a favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, and settlements of legal matters, partially offset by the loss recognized upon the completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor and favorable activity in the prior year related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA. For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had unfavorable impacts of approximately $174 million and $361 million on our Income before income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively.

29 Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENTS Our operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands.
The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

NIKE Direct revenues increased 23%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 31%, comparable store sales growth of 9% and the addition of new stores. Footwear revenues increased 39% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher revenues in Men's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 37%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity, and a lower mix of full-price sales. 31 Table of Contents On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 14%, driven by higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP was primarily due to lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity, and a lower mix of full-price sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT increased 21% primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 320 basis points largely driven by lower margin in our NIKE Direct business due to higher promotional activity, higher product costs reflecting input costs and inbound freight and logistics costs, and a lower mix of full-price sales. This was partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, driven by strategic pricing actions and product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in wage-related expenses and increased NIKE Direct costs. The increase in demand creation expense reflected higher sports marketing expenses and an increase in digital marketing investments.

On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 10%, driven primarily by higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 10%, while ASP per unit remained flat, as higher full-price ASP was offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity. Reported EBIT increased 8% primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points primarily due to higher product costs, reflecting higher input costs and increased inbound freight and logistics costs, lower margins in our NIKE Direct business due to higher promotional activity, a lower mix of full-price sales and higher other costs, in part due to inventory obsolescence. This was partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, largely due to product mix and strategic pricing actions. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily as a result of higher wage-related costs, lower bad debt recoveries and increased NIKE Direct costs. The increase in demand creation expense reflected higher sports marketing expenses and an increase in digital marketing investments, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing expense.

We completed the sale of our entity in Chile and our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to third-party distributors in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively, and the impacts from closing these transactions are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results. This completes the transition of our NIKE Brand businesses in these markets to a distributor operating model. Our CASA marketplace now reflects a full distributor operating model. For more information see Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 34% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories, led by Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia & India, which increased 42%, 37% and 61%, respectively. The transition of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay entities to a third-party distributor operating model reduced APLA revenue growth by approximately 7 percentage points. Revenues increased primarily due to growth in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 35% and comparable store sales growth of 33% in part due to improved physical retail traffic, partially offset by stores included in the sale of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay entities. Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 40%, due primarily to higher revenues in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 38%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was largely driven by higher full-price ASP. Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 24%, due primarily to higher revenues in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of apparel increased 22%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.
Reported EBIT increased 25% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased approximately 190 basis points due to higher product costs reflecting increased inbound freight and logistics costs. This was partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, in part due to strategic pricing actions, lower other costs including warehousing and favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, partially offset by higher operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower investments in digital marketing, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher professional services expenses, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
35 Table of Contents FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 25% for the first six months of fiscal 2023. The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories, led by Korea, Southeast Asia & India, Japan and Pacific, which increased 30%, 63%, 18% and 39%, respectively. Additionally, the transition of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay entities to a third-party distributor operating model reduced APLA growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues in Men’s, Women's and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 32%, comparable store sales growth of 28%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 27%, due primarily to higher revenues in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 18%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 9 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 22%, due primarily to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 20%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.
Reported EBIT increased 13% for the first six months of fiscal 2023 as a result of higher revenues, partially offset higher selling and administrative expense as well as gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased approximately 50 basis points primarily due to higher product costs, reflecting inbound freight and logistics costs, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, in part due to strategic pricing actions, and favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead expense, partially offset by lower demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to higher wage-related expenses and professional services costs, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower investments in digital marketing, partially offset by higher sports marketing expenses.

Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased 14% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 driven primarily by higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in wage-related costs. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense and increased sports marketing expenses. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2022 Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased 17% for the first six months of fiscal 2023 driven by higher operating overhead and higher demand creation expense.

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 12% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as revenue growth in North America, licensee markets and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 14%, driven by strong digital sales growth in North America. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels increased 6%, primarily driven by growth in North America wholesale, while ASP increased 5%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.
Reported EBIT increased 16%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 300 basis points, driven by higher margins in direct to consumer, lower product and other costs and growth in licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased as a result of increased marketing and advertising costs. Operating overhead expense increased as a result of higher wage-related expenses. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2022 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 10% for the first six months of fiscal 2023 as revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets was partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 15%, driven by strong digital sales growth in North America. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels were flat, while ASP increased 9%, driven by growth in direct to consumer. Reported EBIT increased 8%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 260 basis points driven by higher ASP, net of discounts, higher margins in direct to consumer, higher mix of full-price sales and growth in licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased as a result of higher professional services costs, higher wage-related expenses and lower bad debt recoveries. Demand creation expense increased due to higher marketing and advertising costs, partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. 37 Table of Contents CORPORATE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 % CHANGE 2022 2021 % CHANGE Revenues $ 5  $ (16) —  $ 1  $ (37) —  Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $ (744) $ (503) -48  % $ (1,318) $ (1,048) -26  % Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.
In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $241 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the following: • an unfavorable change of $149 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; • an unfavorable change of $149 million primarily related to the loss recognized upon the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor; these results are reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net;
• a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $141 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net; and • an unfavorable change of $84 million primarily related to increased wage-related expenses, reported as a component of consolidated Operating overhead expense.

Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, there have been no material changes to the Company's hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Refer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 8 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. For additional information about our Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: • Product Costs — Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity and factory input costs from the foreign currency adjustments program with certain factories. • Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. • Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.
• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in Other (income) expense, net.
39 Table of Contents TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively, and a benefit of approximately $63 million and $445 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2021, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our
Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $316 million and $569 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively, and a benefit of approximately $12 million and $129 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2021, respectively. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Turkey subsidiary within our EMEA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary markets. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the functional currency of our Turkey subsidiary, changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates. Prior to the completion of the sale of our Argentina entity within our APLA operating segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Management concluded this subsidiary was operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $174 million and $361 million on our Income before income taxes for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $1,358 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to $3,868 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,367 million of operating cash inflow for the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to $3,704 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations
of $2,009 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of $164 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. The net change in working capital compared to the prior year was driven by higher Accounts Receivable of $1,421 million and Inventories of $1,216 million. Higher Accounts Receivable primarily resulted from an increase in sales to wholesale customers and the timing of when those sales were recognized compared to the prior year. Increased Inventories was the result of higher units, mix and input costs in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as a result of supply chain constraints. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $23 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to $1,105 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $423 million compared to a cash outflow of $776 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. 40
Table of Contents Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $3,321 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $1,846 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. The increased outflow in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was driven by higher share repurchases of $2,550 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $1,723 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises, which resulted in a cash inflow of $260 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $846 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 25.5 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $2.6 billion (an average price of $101.96 per share). In August 2022, we terminated the previous four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. Under this program, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total approximate cost of $710.0 million (an average price of $109.85 per share) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 83.8 million shares for a total approximate cost of $9.4 billion (an average price of $111.82 per share) during the term of the program. Upon termination of the four-year, $15 billion program, we began purchasing shares under the new four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of November 30, 2022, we had repurchased 19.0 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.9 billion (an average price of $99.28 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.
CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 21, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2025. As of November 30, 2022, our committed credit facilities were unchanged from the information previously reported on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. Any changes to these ratings could result in interest rate and facility fee changes. As of November 30, 2022, we were in full compliance with the covenants under our facilities and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of the covenants in the foreseeable future. As of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities. Liquidity was also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the three months ended November 30, 2022, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.
To date, in fiscal 2023, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of November 30, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $10.6 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of November 30, 2022, the weighted average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 117 days. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.
There have been no significant changes to the material cash requirements reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of November 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. 41 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 42
Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2022. We are continuing several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout these transformation initiatives. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 43 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ANALYST REPORTS Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE’s business plans, objectives and expected operating or financial results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
