THE
INTERGROUP CORPORATION
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE
1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by The InterGroup Corporation (“InterGroup”
or the “Company”), according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes
the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a
fair statement of the financial position, cash flows and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. It is suggested that
these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of InterGroup and the notes therein included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. The June 30, 2022 Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet was derived from the Consolidated Balance Sheet as included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December
31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
Effective
February 19, 2021, the Company’s
83.7 % owned subsidiary, Santa Fe Financial Corporation (“Santa Fe”), a public company
(OTCBB: SFEF), was liquidated and all of its assets including its
68.8 % interest in Portsmouth Square, Inc. (“Portsmouth”),
a public company (OTCBB: PRSI) were distributed to its shareholders in exchange for their Santa Fe common stock. As of December 31, 2022,
InterGroup owns approximately
75.6 % of the outstanding common shares of Portsmouth and the Company’s President, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer, John V. Winfield, owns approximately
2.5 % of the outstanding common shares of Portsmouth. Mr. Winfield
also serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Portsmouth.
Portsmouth’s
primary business was conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors Limited Partnership, a California
limited partnership (“Justice” or the “Partnership”). Effective July 15, 2021,
Portsmouth
completed the purchase of
100 % of the limited partnership interest of Justice through the acquisition of the remaining
0.7 % non-controlling
interest.
Effective
December 23, 2021, the Partnership was dissolved. The financial statements
of Justice were consolidated with those of Portsmouth.
Prior
to its dissolution effective December 23, 2021, Justice owned and operated a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San
Francisco, California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the “Hotel”) and related facilities including
a five-level underground parking garage through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”) and Justice
Mezzanine Company, LLC (“Mezzanine”). Mezzanine was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Mezzanine. Effective December 23, 2021, Portsmouth replaced Justice as the single member of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the
borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice. In December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating.
The Hotel is a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (“Hilton”)
through January 31, 2030.
Aimbridge
Hospitality (“Aimbridge”) manages the Hotel, along with its five-level parking garage, under certain Hotel management agreement
(“HMA”) with Operating. The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the February
3, 2017 date and automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, to not exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain
conditions. Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Aimbridge shall be one and seven-tenths percent (1.70%) of total
Hotel revenue.
In
addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership of real estate. Properties include apartment
complexes, commercial real estate, and three single-family houses as strategic investments. The properties are located throughout the
United States but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has investments in unimproved real property. All
the Company’s residential rental properties and its commercial rental property are managed in-house.

There
have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Please
refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 for a summary of the significant accounting
policies. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet. Finance leases of $ 183,000
as of June 30, 2022, were reclassified to Accounts
Payable and Other Liabilities - Hotel. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.
Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As
of December 31, 2022, there was no material impact from the recent adoption of new accounting pronouncements, nor expected material impact
from recently issued accounting pronouncements yet to be adopted, on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
NOTE

LIQUIDITY
Historically,
our cash flows have been primarily generated from our Hotel and real estate operations. However, the responses by federal, state, and
local civil authorities to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a material detrimental impact on our liquidity. For the six months
ended December 31, 2022, our net cash flow used for operations was $ 2,509,000 . We have cautiously re-established certain services at our
Hotel but have continued to take steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity at our Hotel, including implementing strict cost management
measures to eliminate non-essential expenses, renegotiating certain reoccurring expenses, and temporarily closing certain hotel services
and outlets. As the hospitality and travel environment continues its recovery, Portsmouth will continue to evaluate what services it
brings back. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Portsmouth continued to make capital improvements to the hotel in the amount
of $ 2,682,000
and anticipates continuing its guest room upgrade program during the remaining of fiscal year 2023. During the six months
ended December 31, 2022 the Company made capital improvements in the amount of $ 1,820,000
to its multi-family and commercial real estate.
The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 8,153,000
and $ 14,367,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of $ 7,753,000
and $ 8,982,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of $ 15,526,000
and $ 10,110,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature.
On
December 16, 2020, Justice and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from
InterGroup as needed up to $ 10,000,000
and extended the maturity date of the loan to
July 31, 2021 . As of the date of this report,
the maturity date was extended to July 31, 2023 . On September 7, 2021, the Board of InterGroup passed resolution to provide funding
to Portsmouth for the working capital of the Hotel up to $ 16,000,000
if necessary. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021,
Portsmouth assumed Justice’s note payable to InterGroup in the amount of $ 11,350,000 . On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and
InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which memorialized the increase to $ 16,000,000
and the substitution of
Portsmouth for Justice. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $ 7,550,000
to the Hotel, bringing the total
amount due to InterGroup to $ 14,200,000
as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, the Company does not anticipate any
need for additional funding from InterGroup. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to
InterGroup. The Company could amend its by-laws and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise
capital in the public markets if needed.
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company refinanced five of our properties’ existing mortgages and obtained a mortgage
note payable on one of our California properties, generating net proceeds totaling $ 16,683,000 . The Company will continue to evaluate
other refinancing opportunities and could refinance additional multifamily properties should the need arise, or should management consider
the interest rate environment favorable. In July 2022, the Company renewed its uncollateralized revolving line of credit from CIBC Bank
USA (“CIBC”) at a reduced amount of $ 2,000,000
from $ 5,000,000
and the entire $ 2,000,000
is available to be drawn down should
additional liquidity be necessary. The entire $ 2,000,000
is available to draw down as of December 31, 2022.

-
The
Company’s known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures,
including management and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our
outstanding indebtedness, and repairs and maintenance at all our properties.
Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel and our real estate properties. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including
from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing
our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position, after giving effect to the transactions discussed above, will be adequate
to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, taxes
and compliance costs and other commitments, for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, even
if the economic recovery takes longer than anticipated. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage
levels and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that management will
be successful with its plan.

Performance
obligations
We
identified the following performance obligations for which revenue is recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied,
which results in recognizing the amount we expect to be entitled to for providing the goods or services:
●
Cancelable room reservations
or ancillary services
are typically satisfied as the good or service is transferred to the hotel guest, which is generally when
the room stay occurs.
-
10
-
●
Non-cancelable room
reservations and banquet or conference reservations
represent a series of distinct goods or services provided over time and satisfied
as each distinct good or service is provided, which is reflected by the duration of the room reservation.
●
Other ancillary goods
and services
are purchased independently of the room reservation at standalone selling prices and are considered separate performance
obligations, which are satisfied when the related good or service is provided to the hotel guest.
●
Components of package
reservations
for which each component could be sold separately to other hotel guests are considered separate performance obligations
and are satisfied as set forth above.
Hotel
revenue primarily consists of hotel room rentals, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package
reservations), food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking). Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied
or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the goods and services are
provided. For package reservations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations within the package based on the
estimated standalone selling prices of each component.
We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due to the
nature of our business, our revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests staying at
our hotel are refunded to hotel guests if the guest cancels within the specified time period, before any services are rendered. Refunds
related to service are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the hotel stay occurs or services are
rendered.
Contract
assets and liabilities
We
do not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, other than trade and other receivables, net on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our receivables are primarily the result of contracts with customers, which are reduced by an allowance
for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of amounts that will not be collected.
We
record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of guests staying at our hotel, which are presented
within accounts payable and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and had a balance of $ 493,000
at July 1, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the entire $ 493,000
was recognized as revenue. Contract liabilities increased to $ 1,828,000
as of December 31, 2022. The increase at December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by advance deposits received from customers for
services to be performed after December 31, 2022. Contract liabilities at July 1, 2021 was $ 161,000 . During the six months ended December 31,2021, the entire $ 161,000
was recognized as revenues. Contract liabilities was $ 445,000
as of December 31, 2021.
Contract
costs
We
consider sales commissions earned to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract with our customers. As a practical expedient, we expense
these costs as incurred as our contracts with customers are less than one year.

The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of
10

To
fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and to repay the prior mortgage of $ 42,940,000 , Justice obtained a $ 97,000,000
mortgage
loan and a $ 20,000,000
mezzanine loan in December 2013. The 10- year mortgage loan is secured by the Company’s principal asset,
the Hotel. The mortgage loan bears an interest rate of
5.275 %
per annum with interest only payments due through January 2017. Beginning
in February 2017, the loan began to amortize over a thirty-year period through its maturity date of January 2024. Outstanding principal
balance on the loan was $ 88,135,000
and $ 89,114,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. As additional security for
the mortgage loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mortgage lender. The mezzanine loan is secured
by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan.
The mezzanine interest only loan had
an interest rate of 9.75% per annum and a maturity date of January 1, 2024.
As additional security for the mezzanine loan, there is a
limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mezzanine lender. On July 31, 2019, Mezzanine refinanced the mezzanine loan by
entering into a new mezzanine loan agreement (“New Mezzanine Loan Agreement”) with Cred Reit Holdco LLC in the amount of
$ 20,000,000 . The prior Mezzanine Loan which had a
9.75 %
per annum interest rate was paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan
is
7.25 %
and the loan matures on
January 1, 2024 . Interest only payments are due monthly.

Effective
May 11, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under the environmental
indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership’s $ 97,000,000
mortgage loan and the $ 20,000,000
mezzanine loan. Pursuant to
the agreement, InterGroup is required to maintain certain net worth and liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, InterGroup is in compliance
with both requirements. However, due to the Hotel’s ongoing recovery from the negative impact of Covid19 in the Hotel’s cash
flow, Justice Operating Company, LLC have not been meeting certain of its loan covenants such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”)
which would trigger the creation of a lockbox by the Lender for all cash collected by the Hotel. However, such lockbox has been created
and utilized from the loan inception and will be in place up to loan maturity regardless of the DSCR.
On December 16, 2020, Justice and InterGroup
entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to $ 10,000,000
and
extended the maturity date of the loan to
July 31, 2021 . As of the date of this report,
the maturity date was extended to July 31, 2023 . On September 7, 2021, the Board of InterGroup passed resolution to provide funding to Portsmouth for the working capital of
the Hotel up to $ 16,000,000
if necessary. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed Justice’s note
payable to InterGroup in the amount of $ 11,350,000 . On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification
agreement which memorialized the increase to $ 16,000,000
and the substitution of Portsmouth for Justice. During the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $ 7,550,000
to the Hotel, bringing the total amount due to InterGroup to $ 14,200,000
as of
June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, the Company does not anticipate any need for additional funding from InterGroup. As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. The Company could amend its by-laws
and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets if needed.
In
July 2018, InterGroup obtained a revolving $ 5,000,000
line of credit (“RLOC”) from CIBC Bank USA (“CIBC”).
The
RLOC carries a variable interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 3%. Interest is paid on a monthly basis. In July 2019, the Company obtained
a modification from CIBC which extended the maturity date of the RLOC from July 24, 2019 to July 23, 2020 . In July 2020, InterGroup entered
into a second modification agreement with CIBC which extended the maturity date of its RLOC to July 21, 2021. In July 2022, the Company
renewed its RLOC for a year at a reduced amount of $ 2,000,000
from the $ 5,000,000
and the entire $ 2,000,000
is available to be drawn
down should additional liquidity be necessary.
As
disclosed in its Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on January 25, 2021, Santa Fe received shareholder
approval to distribute its assets, as described and subsequently dissolve, all as set forth in the Information Statement. As InterGroup
formerly owned
83.7 %
of the outstanding common stock of Santa Fe, the Company received cash of $ 5,013,000
and
422,998
shares of Portsmouth
common stock in March 2021 as a result of the liquidation of Santa Fe. As a former
3.7 % shareholder of Santa Fe, the Company’s
President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, John Winfield, received cash of $ 221,000
and
18,641
shares of Portsmouth
common stock in March 2021 as a result of the liquidation of Santa Fe. On April 12, 2021, Santa Fe received a filed stamped copy of its
Articles of Dissolution from the State of Nevada, and Santa Fe is effectively fully dissolved and no longer in legal existence. In June
2022, InterGroup received a distribution of $ 1,159,000
of from Santa Fe as the entity received federal and state tax refunds from previously
filed final tax returns.
Five
of the Portsmouth directors serve as directors of InterGroup. Director Jerold R. Babin, 90, passed away in October 2022. Steve Grunwald
is a Director of Portsmouth and replaced Director Babin and became a Director of the Company. The Company’s director and Chairman
of the Audit Committee, William J. Nance, serves as Comstock’s director and Chairman of the Audit and Finance, Compensation and
Nominating and Governance Committees of Comstock. The Company’s Vice President Real Estate was elected President of Portsmouth
in May 2021.
As
Chairman of the Executive Strategic Real Estate and Securities Investment Committee, the Company’s President and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), John V. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted
by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Portsmouth and directs the
investment activity of Portsmouth. Effective June 2016, Mr. Winfield became the Managing Director of Justice and served in that position
until the dissolution of Justice in December 2021. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive
Officer and Portsmouth may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests
of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the
resources of Portsmouth, at risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on behalf
of the Company.

2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS
This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”).
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our business,
our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, the impact to our business and financial condition, and measures being taken
in response to the novel strain of coronavirus and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”), the effects of competition and the
effects of future legislation or regulations and other non-historical statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that
are not historical facts, and in some cases, can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words “outlook,”
“believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,”
“should,” “could,” “seeks,” “projects,” “predicts,” “intends,”
“plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are,
in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance
or future achievements or events.
Such
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:
national and worldwide economic conditions, including the impact of recessionary conditions on tourism, travel and the lodging industry;
the impact of terrorism and war on the national and international economies, including tourism, securities markets, energy and fuel costs;
natural disasters; general economic conditions and competition in the hotel industry in the San Francisco area; seasonality, labor relations
and labor disruptions; actual and threatened pandemics such as swine flu or the outbreak of COVID-19 or similar outbreaks; the ability
to obtain financing at favorable interest rates and terms; securities markets, regulatory factors, litigation and other factors discussed
below in this Report and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. These risks and uncertainties
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as to the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions
to those forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events.
COVID19
UPDATE
The
novel strain of coronavirus and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”) have continued to affect the hospitality industry and
our business. Beginning in March 2020, travel restrictions and mandated closings of non-essential businesses were imposed, which resulted
in temporary suspensions of operations in many hotels in San Francisco, however, the Company did not suspend operations and did not close
the hotel. As vaccination rates across the country increased and COVID-19 related restrictions were eased or removed, we saw an increase
in travel and hospitality spending beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2021. During calendar year 2022, we continued to witness
robust leisure demand and an acceleration in group and business transient demand. However, the potential for an economic slowdown or
a recession during calendar year 2023 may disrupt the positive momentum at the Company’s hotel and our industry.
We
believe the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine during 2021 drove the improvement in traveler sentiment we experienced and resulted
in an improvement in occupancy, Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) and Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) during 2021.
If additional virus variants emerge causing re-imposed widespread travel restrictions, the hospitality industry will be negatively affected.
While there can be no assurances that the Company will not experience further fluctuations in hotel revenues or earnings due to the uncertainty
of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, increases in interest rates, potential economic slowdown or a recession
and geopolitical conflicts, we expect to continue to recover through the remainder of fiscal year 2023 based on current demand trends.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company owned approximately 75.6% of the common shares of Portsmouth Square, Inc. The Company’s principal
sources of revenue are revenues from the hotel owned by Portsmouth, rental income from its investments in multi-family and commercial
real estate properties, and income received from investment of its cash and securities assets.
Portsmouth’s
primary asset is a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California 94108, known as the “Hilton
San Francisco Financial District” (the “Hotel” or the “Property”) and related facilities, including a five-level
underground parking garage. The financial statements of Portsmouth have been consolidated with those of the Company.
In
addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership and management of its real estate. Properties
include sixteen apartment complexes, one commercial real estate property, and three single-family houses as strategic investments. The
properties are located throughout the United States but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has an investment
in unimproved real property in Hawaii.
The
Company acquires its investments in real estate and other investments utilizing cash, securities or debt, subject to approval or guidelines
of the Board of Directors. The Company also invests in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and will consider other
investments if such investments offer growth or profit potential.

garage decreased by $51,000 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The year over year increase in all the revenue sources
except in garage revenues, are as a result of the recovery from the business interruption attributable to a variety of responses by federal,
state, and local civil authority to the COVID-19 outbreak since March 2020. Total operating expenses increased by $2,247,000 due to an
increase in salaries and wages, commission, credit card fees, management fees, and franchise fees.

have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. However, the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities
for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value. For a
more detailed description of the composition of the Company’s marketable securities see the Marketable Securities section below.
The
Company and its subsidiary Portsmouth compute and file income tax returns and prepare discrete income tax provisions for financial reporting.
The income tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represent primarily the income tax effect of the pretax

FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of $8,153,000 and $14,367,000 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of $7,753,000 and $8,982,000 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of $15,526,000 and $10,110,000 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature.
On December 16, 2020, Justice and InterGroup entered into a loan modification
agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to $10,000,000 and extended the maturity date of the
loan to July 31, 2021. The maturity date was extended to July 31, 2023. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed
Justice’s note payable to InterGroup in the amount of $11,350,000. On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into
a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth’s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to $16,000,000. During the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $7,550,000 to the Hotel, bringing the total amount due to InterGroup to $14,200,000 as
of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, Portsmouth does not anticipate any need for funding from InterGroup. As of December
31, 2022, Portsmouth has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. Portsmouth could amend its by-laws and increase the
number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets or refinance the hotel if needed. The note
receivable from Portsmouth is eliminated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
During
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the Company refinanced six of its properties’ existing mortgages and obtained a mortgage
note payable on one of our California properties, generating net proceeds totaling $16,683,000. The Company is currently evaluating other
refinancing opportunities and we could refinance additional multifamily properties should the need arise, or should management consider
the interest rate environment favorable.
The
Company had an uncollateralized $5,000,000 revolving line of credit (“LOC”) from CIBC Bank USA (“CIBC”) and the
entire $5,000,000 was available to be drawn down as of June 30, 2022. In July 2022, the Company renewed it’s LOC for a reduced
amount of $2,000,000 and is available in its entirety as of December 31, 2022.
Our
known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including management
and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness,
and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel.
Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel and our real estate properties. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including
from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing
our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position, after giving effect to the transactions discussed above, will be adequate
to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, taxes
and compliance costs and other commitments, for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, even
if current levels of low occupancy were to persist. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels
and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that management will be successful
with its plan.

IMPACT
OF INFLATION
Hotel
room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited
number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Aimbridge has the power
and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis,
there
should be minimal impact on Hotel’s revenues due to inflation. The Company’s revenues are also subject to interest rate risks,
which may be influenced by inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company’s income is
not viewed by management as material.
The
Company’s residential rental properties provide income from short-term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year. Rental
increases are expected to offset anticipated increased property operating expenses. The C ompany
refinanced most of its mortgages with favorable long-term fixed interest rate mortgages during the past three fiscal years.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Critical
accounting estimates are those that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require
judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances
for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates,
or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical
accounting policies or method or assumptions during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
INCOME
TAXES
Judgment
is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or
tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject
to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return
to determine whether they are more likely than not of being sustained, assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by
taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information, prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial
statements. If a position does not meet the more likely than not standard, the benefit cannot be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and
the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision
for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard with respect to a position could materially
impact our consolidated financial statements. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 13 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements” on Form 10K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
DEFERRED
INCOME TAXES – VALUATION ALLOWANCE
We
assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable. This assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on the weight
of both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. Cumulative pre-tax losses
for the three-year period are considered significant objective negative evidence that some or all of our deferred tax assets may not
be realizable. Cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive
pre-tax income in the future. In accordance with GAAP, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight
placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. When necessary, we use systematic and logical
methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse
and generate tax deductions. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. However, significant judgment will be required to determine
the timing and amount of any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” on Form 10K for the year ended June 30, 2022.

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
We
evaluate property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly, and when events or circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable, we evaluate the net book value of the assets by comparing to the projected undiscounted cash
flows of the assets. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist and consider our knowledge of the hospitality
industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time
of the assessment. The results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts
and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When an indicator of impairment exists, judgment is also required in determining
the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group,
if applicable. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived
assets in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets
impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those
estimates. There were no impairment losses recorded during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

OTHER
INFORMATION

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Portsmouth
Square, Inc., through its operating company Justice Investors Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”),
is the owner of the real property located at 750 Kearny Street in San Francisco, currently improved with a 27 – story building
which houses a Hilton Hotel (the “Property”). The Property was improved pursuant to approvals granted by the City and County
of San Francisco (the “City”) in 1970. Those approvals included a Major Encroachment Permit (“Permit”) by which
the Company was required by the City to construct an ornamental overhead pedestrian bridge across Kearny Street, connecting the Property
to the City park and underground parking garage known as Portsmouth Square (the “Bridge”). The construction of the Bridge
was a condition of the City’s approval of the construction of the hotel structure on the Property. Effective on May 24, 2022, the
City has revoked the Permit and directed the Company to remove the Bridge at the Company’s expense, including construction management
costs and traffic control. Pursuant to a letter dated June 13, 2022, the City’s Department of Public works specifically directed
the “removal of the unpermitted pedestrian bridge and all related physical encroachments in the public right-of-way and on City
property” and the submission of a general bridge removal and restoration plan (the “Plan”). The Company disputes the
legality of the purported revocation of the Permit. The Company further disputes any obligation to remove the Bridge at its expense.
In particular, representatives of the Company participated in meetings with the City since August 1, 2019, discussing a collaborative
process for the possible removal of the Bridge. Until the recent revocation of the Permit in 2022, the City representatives repeatedly
and consistently promised and agreed that the City will pay for the associated costs of any Bridge removal. Nevertheless, without waiving
any rights, in an effort to understand all of the available options, and to provide a response to the City’s directives, the Company
has engaged a Project Manager, a structural engineering firm, an architect to advise on the process and for the development of a Plan
for the Bridge removal, as well as the reconstruction of the front of the Hilton Hotel and a legal team. The Plan is currently not expected
to be completed until early in 2023. At this time, early estimates of the cost of the Plan exceed $2 million. The Company is currently
in discussions with the City regarding both the process and financial responsibility for the implementation of the Plan for the Bridge
removal. Those discussions are expected to continue well into 2023.
