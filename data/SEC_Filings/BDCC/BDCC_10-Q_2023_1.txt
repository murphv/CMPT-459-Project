NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 30, 2022   NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS   Organization and Basis of Presentation   Organization
Power Americas Resources Group Ltd.. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 11, 2010 under the name Benefit Solutions Outsourcing Corp.   The Company was engaged in the marketing of a craft beer which was brewed, distributed, and marketed solely in Quebec, Canada until the change of control which occurred in March 2019, at which time it ceased business operations.
Going forward, the Company intends to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for its shareholders. The Company has no particular business combination in mind and has not entered into any negotiations regarding such a combination.   On February 11, 2019, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 21, 2017, by and among Stephan Pilon, Pol Brisset (the “ Selling Stockholders ”), and Redstone Ventures, LTD (the “ Purchaser ”), the Purchaser purchased an aggregate of
151,220
(Post split) shares of common stock of Brisset Beer International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “ Company ”), from the Selling Stockholders for $ 0.119
per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $ 18,000 . The 151,220 shares of common stock (Post split)  purchase by the Purchaser from the Selling Stockholders represent approximately
76.66 % of the outstanding
197,260
(Post split) shares of common stock of the Company and constitute a change in control of the Company. The source of funds was working capital of the Purchaser. Mr. S. Polishetty has voting and dispositive control over the Purchaser.   On September 13, 2022, the Company received notice of resignation from Kevin G. Malone from the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Sole-Director of the Corporation and appointed Mark Croskery to serve as President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Corporation   NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in US dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company commenced its craft brewing activities in September 2014. During the six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company has incurred net losses of $ 209,401
and accumulated deficits of $ 2,608,254 . The Company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   Our current operations have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities as well as additional funding received through the issuance of convertible notes and stock issuances. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.   The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable. Management may seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock. Although there are no assurances that management’s plans will be realized, management believes that the Company will be able to continue operations in the future.
COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our consultants and vendors. Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially; however, management cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.     7 Table of Contents    NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements represent the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Power Americas, Inc. prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, and its 100% owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The cash account that is held in Canadian Dollar, and foreign exchange transaction gain (loss) resulting from fluctuations in the currency exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar has been recorded in the statements of operations. Translation gain (loss) is reported as a component of other accumulated comprehensive income, which was nil during the year ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.   Stock-based compensation   The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.   The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by ASC 505-50   Concentration of Credit Risk   The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company maintains all of its cash balances with two financial institutions in the form of demand deposits.     8 Table of Contents   Earnings per share   The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods of net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because they are antidilutive. There were no potential equivalent shares of Common Stock as of November 30, 2022.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with  ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.   Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.   Income Taxes     Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company measures fair value in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are:   Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.   Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.   Level 3 - Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Valuation of instruments includes unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.    As defined by ASC 820, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, which was further clarified as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (“an exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date     9 Table of Contents   The reported fair values for financial instruments that use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of factors and assumptions. Accordingly, certain fair values may not represent actual values of the Company’s financial instruments that could have been realized as of November 30, 2022 or that will be recognized in the future, and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual settlement. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, receivables from related parties, prepaid expenses and other, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and related party and third party notes payables approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Company’s notes payable to related parties approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management’s best estimate of terms that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022.   Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of November 30, 2022:        Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Liabilities                         Derivative Financial Instruments   $ -     $ -     $ 8,090     $ 8,090     As of November 30, 2022, the Company’s stock price was $ 0.001 , risk-free discount rate of

0.01 %.   Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of May 31, 2022:       Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Liabilities                         Derivative Financial Instruments   $ -     $ -     $ 7,526     $ 7,526     As of May 31, 2022, the Company’s stock price was $ 0.15 , risk-free discount rate of

0.1 %   The following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of the derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:       Amount   Balance May 31, 2022   $ 7,526   Debt discount

( 2,046 ) Change in fair market value of derivative liabilities     635   Balance November 30, 2022   $ 8,090     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt—Debt with “Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We will do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.     10 Table of Contents   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements, such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.   In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payments (“ASU 2018-07”). This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The effective date for the standard is for interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, but no earlier than the Company’s adoption date of Topic 606. Under the new guidance, the measurement of nonemployee equity awards is fixed on the grant date. The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2018-07 will have on the consolidated financial statements.   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.    NOTE 4 –ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.   Going concern – The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in US dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

The Company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of November 30, 2022, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.     17 Table of Contents   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt—Debt with “Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We will do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements, such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.   In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payments (“ASU 2018-07”). This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The effective date for the standard is for interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, but no earlier than the Company’s adoption date of Topic 606. Under the new guidance, the measurement of nonemployee equity awards is fixed on the grant date. The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2018-07 will have on the consolidated financial statements.   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.     18 Table of Contents   Item 3.
