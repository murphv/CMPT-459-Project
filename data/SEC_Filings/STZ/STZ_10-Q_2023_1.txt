AND SUBSIDIARIES NOVEMBER 30, 2022 (unaudited) 1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION We have prepared the Financial Statements, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to quarterly reporting on Form 10-Q and reflect, in our opinion, all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial information. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations. These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the 2022 Annual Report. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results. 2.     INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.
Elements of cost include materials, labor, and overhead and consist of the following: November 30, 2022 February 28, 2022 (in millions) Raw materials and supplies $ 227.8   $ 185.3   In-process inventories 989.1   804.8   Finished case goods 585.1   583.1   $ 1,802.0   $ 1,573.2   We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.
We evaluated
the carrying value of certain inventories and recognized the following in cost of product sold within our consolidated results of operations: For the Nine Months Ended November 30, For the Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021
(1) 2022 2021 (in millions) Loss on inventory write-down $ 15.7   $ 85.2   $ 4.5   $ 2.6   (1) We recognized a loss predominantly from excess inventory of hard seltzers, within the Beer segment, largely resulting from a slowdown in the overall category which occurred in early Fiscal 2022. 3.     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Overview Our risk management and derivative accounting policies are presented in Notes 1 and 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report and have not changed significantly for the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2022. We have an investment in certain equity securities and other rights which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of Canopy (see Note 7). This investment is included in securities measured at fair value and is accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      7 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Table of Contents changes in fair value of this investment recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 4). We will no longer have this investment if the Canopy Transaction is completed. The aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows: November 30, 2022 February 28, 2022 (in millions) Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency contracts $ 1,952.5   $ 1,863.2   Pre-issuance hedge contracts $ —   $ 100.0   Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency contracts $ 813.8   $ 497.6   Commodity derivative contracts $ 341.1   $ 291.1   Credit risk We are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored. Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial. In addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements. As of November 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was $ 3.6
million. If we were required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on November 30, 2022, we would have had sufficient available liquidity on hand to satisfy this obligation. Results of period derivative activity The estimated fair value and location of our derivative instruments on our balance sheets are as follows (see Note 4): Assets Liabilities November 30, 2022 February 28, 2022 November 30, 2022 February 28, 2022 (in millions) Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency contracts: Prepaid expenses and other $ 80.2   $ 28.6   Other accrued expenses and liabilities $ 10.9   $ 5.9   Other assets $ 104.8   $ 25.1   Deferred income taxes and other liabilities $ 4.8   $ 8.6   Pre-issuance hedge contracts: Other assets $ —   $ —   Deferred income taxes and other liabilities $ —   $ 0.4   Constellation Brands, Inc.

The hierarchy includes three levels: • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as volatility, interest rates, and yield curves that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and • Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Fair value methodology The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments: Foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts The fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, entered into valuation models. These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves, and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement). Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      10 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Table of Contents Interest rate swap and Pre-issuance hedge contracts The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties. Quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services (Level 2 fair value measurement). Canopy investment Equity securities, Warrants
–
The November 2018 Canopy Warrants consist of three tranches of warrants, including
88.5
million Tranche A Warrants expiring November 1, 2023, which are currently exercisable,
38.4
million Tranche B Warrants expiring November 1, 2026, and
12.8
million Tranche C Warrants expiring November 1, 2026. If the Canopy Transaction is completed we will no longer have the November 2018 Canopy Warrants.
The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants are as follows

(10) 0.0   % 0.0   % 0.0   % 0.0   % (1) The exercise price for the Tranche C Warrants is based on the VWAP Exercise Price. The Tranche C Warrants are not included in the table as there is no fair value assigned. (2) In connection with the Acreage Transaction, we obtained other rights which include a share repurchase credit. If Canopy has not purchased the lesser of
27,378,866
Canopy common shares, or C$ 1,583.0
million worth of Canopy common shares for cancellation between April 18, 2019, and two-years after the full exercise of the Tranche A Warrants, we will be credited an amount that will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable upon each exercise of the Tranche B Warrants and Tranche C Warrants. The credit will be an amount equal to the difference between C$ 1,583.0
million and the actual price paid by Canopy in purchasing its common shares for cancellation. The likelihood of receiving the share repurchase credit if we were to fully exercise the Tranche A Warrants is remote, therefore, no fair value has been assigned. (3) The fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement). (4) The fair value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). (5) Based on the exercise price from the applicable underlying agreements. (6) Based on the closing market price for Canopy common shares on the TSX as of the applicable date. (7) Based on the expiration date of the warrants. (8) Based on consideration of historical and/or implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels. (9) Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expiration date of the applicable warrants. (10) Based on historical dividend levels. Debt securities
–
We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities. Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense. The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance but may be settled prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events. The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as

If the Canopy Transaction is completed we expect to negotiate an exchange of our Canopy Debt Securities. For additional information, refer to Note 7. The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows: November 30, 2022 February 28, 2022 Settlement price

In June 2022, the Canopy Debt Securities were amended to remove Canopy’s right to settle the Canopy Debt Securities on conversion into Canopy common shares. As a result, the Canopy Debt Securities may only be settled in cash. Prior to the June 2022 amendment, the Canopy Debt Securities could be settled, at Canopy’s option, in cash, Canopy common shares, or a combination thereof. (2) Based on the closing market price for Canopy common shares on the TSX as of the applicable date. (3) Based on the contractual maturity date of the notes. (4) Based on consideration of historical and/or implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security, adjusted for certain risks associated with debt securities, as appropriate. (5) Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the Canopy Debt Securities. (6) Based on historical dividend levels. Short-term borrowings Our short-term borrowings consist of our commercial paper program and the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility. The revolving credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility). For these short-term borrowings, the carrying value approximates the fair value. Long-term debt The term loans under our term loan credit agreements are variable interest rate bearing notes with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating. The carrying values approximate the fair value of the term loans. The fair value of the remaining fixed interest rate long-term debt is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 fair value measurement). The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximate fair value as of November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of November 30, 2022, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 11,296.7

Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      13 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Table of Contents Nonrecurring basis measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis for which an impairment assessment was performed for the periods presented: Fair Value Measurements Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Losses (in millions) For the Nine Months Ended November 30, 2022 Equity method investments $ 621.4   $ —   $ —   $ 1,060.3   For the Nine Months Ended November 30, 2021 Long-lived assets
(1) $ —   $ —   $ 20.0   $ 665.9   (1) As of November 30, 2022, we determined the remaining Mexicali Brewery net assets have met held for sale criteria. The carrying value of assets held for sale are included in other assets within our consolidated balance sheet and we have concluded that no additional impairment existed . Equity method investments As of August 31, 2022, we evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended June 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis permissibility. As a result, the Canopy Equity Method Investment with a carrying value of $ 1,695.1  million was written down to its estimated fair value of $ 634.8
million, resulting in an impairment of $ 1,060.3
million. This loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for the nine months ended November 30, 2022. The estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of August 31, 2022. There may be a future impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if our expectations about Canopy’s prospective results and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions or if Canopy records another significant impairment of goodwill or intangible or other long-lived assets, makes significant asset sales, or has changes in senior management. Long-lived assets In April 2021, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell or abandon the Mexicali Brewery. Subsequently, management determined that we will be unable to use or repurpose certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery. Accordingly, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, long-lived assets with a carrying value of $ 685.9
million were written down to their estimated fair value of $ 20.0
million, resulting in an impairment of $ 665.9
million. This impairment was included in impairment of brewery construction in progress within our consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. Our estimate of fair value was determined based on the expected salvage value of the assets. The Mexicali Brewery is a component of the Beer segment. In April 2022, we announced that, with the assistance of the Mexican government and state and local officials in Mexico, we acquired land in Veracruz for the construction of the Veracruz Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. The design and construction process for the Veracruz Brewery is underway. We continue to work with government officials in Mexico to pursue various forms of recovery for capitalized costs and additional expenses incurred in connection with the canceled Mexicali Brewery construction project, however, there can be no assurance of any recoveries. In the medium-term, under normal operating conditions, we have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer needs based on current growth forecasts and current and planned production capabilities.

years based on performance, with a
50 % minimum guarantee due at the end of the earn-out period. The results of operations of My Favorite Neighbor are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. We recognized a gain of $ 13.5
million for the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2021, related to the remeasurement of our previously held

99 % of principal value for newly issued Canopy common shares. As part of this transaction, we exchanged C$ 100.0
million principal amount of our Canopy Debt Securities for Canopy common shares which we received in July 2022. This exchange did not significantly change our Canopy ownership percentage. Canopy Equity Method Investment We complement our beverage alcohol strategy with our investment in Canopy, a leading provider of medicinal and recreational cannabis products. Equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities is determined by recording the effect of basis differences.
Amounts included in our consolidated results of operations for each period are as follows: For the Nine Months Ended November 30, For the Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Equity in earnings (losses) from Canopy and related activities

million goodwill impairment related to Canopy’s cannabis operations for the nine months ended November 30, 2022. We evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment as of August 31, 2022, and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended June 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis permissibility. Canopy has various equity and convertible debt securities outstanding, including primarily equity awards granted to its employees, and options and warrants issued to various third parties, including our November 2018 Canopy Warrants, and the Acreage Financial Instrument (a call option for Canopy to acquire up to
100 % of the shares of Acreage). As of November 30, 2022, the exercise and/or conversion of certain of these outstanding securities could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy. The following table presents summarized financial information for Canopy prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recognize our equity in earnings (losses) for Canopy on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy’s earnings (losses) for the periods January through September 2022 and January through September 2021 in our nine months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, results, respectively.

Canopy only holds non-voting and non-participating exchangeable shares of Canopy USA which are convertible into common shares of Canopy USA. Third-party investors will hold
100 % of the common shares of Canopy USA. In connection with the Canopy Transaction, Canopy has proposed to amend its share capital to (i) create Exchangeable Shares and (ii) restate the rights of Canopy common shares to provide for their conversion into Exchangeable Shares through the Canopy Amendment. Canopy has stated its intention to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to consider the Canopy Amendment. We have entered into a voting support agreement with Canopy to vote in favor of the Canopy Amendment. If the Canopy Transaction is completed and the Canopy Amendment is authorized by Canopy’s shareholders and adopted by Canopy, we intend, subject to a final decision in our sole discretion, to exercise our right to convert our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares. Additionally, if the Canopy Amendment is authorized by Canopy’s shareholders, we and Canopy intend to negotiate an exchange of up to C$ 100.0  million aggregate principal amount of our Canopy Debt Securities for Exchangeable Shares. Assuming the completion of the Canopy Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Consent Agreement and that we elect to convert our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares: • we intend to surrender our November 2018 Canopy Warrants to Canopy for cancellation; • we will only have an interest in Exchangeable Shares, which are non-voting and non-participating securities, and our remaining Canopy Debt Securities; • we intend to terminate all legacy agreements and commercial arrangements between ourselves and Canopy, including the investor rights agreement but excluding the Consent Agreement and certain termination agreements; • we will have no further governance rights in relation to Canopy, including rights to nominate members to the board of directors of Canopy or approval rights related to certain transactions, • all of our nominees will resign from the board of directors of Canopy; and
• as our investment in Canopy common shares makes up our Canopy Equity Method Investment, we expect to no longer: ◦ apply the equity method to our investment in Canopy, which we expect will instead be accounted for at fair value with changes reported in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results; and ◦ have a stand-alone Canopy operating segment as Canopy’s financial results will no longer be provided to, or reviewed by, our

In June 2022, we redeemed the remaining $ 198.2  million and $ 369.8  million outstanding principal balance of the
3.20 % February 2018 Senior Notes and the
4.25 % May 2013 Senior Notes, respectively. Total cash consideration paid was $ 575.5  million, which included the remaining principal amount of the notes of $ 568.0
million and a make-whole premium of $ 7.5  million which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt within our consolidated results for the nine months ended November 30, 2022. Debt payments As of November 30, 2022, the required principal repayments under long-term debt obligations (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts of $ 59.0
million and $ 22.1
million, respectively) for the remaining three months of Fiscal 2023 and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter are as follows: (in millions) Fiscal 2023 $ 3.5   Fiscal 2024 9.1   Fiscal 2025 1,256.1   Fiscal 2026 1,904.3   Fiscal 2027 603.4   Fiscal 2028 1,801.3   Thereafter 5,800.1   $ 11,377.8   9.     INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, was
305.7 % and ( 115.8 )%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, was
21.5 % and
17.1 %, respectively. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, our effective tax rate did not approximate the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy, partially offset by a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture. For the three months ended November 30, 2022, our effective tax rate approximated the federal statutory rate of 21% as an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy was largely offset by a benefit of lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. For the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2021, our effective tax rate did not approximate the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (i) an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy, (ii) a benefit of lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, and (iii) recognition of a net income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity. For the nine months ended November 30, 2021, our effective rate was also impacted by the long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress. Constellation Brands, Inc.

one
class of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Stock. Holders of Class A Stock are entitled to
one
vote per share. In addition, we have a class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Stock. Shares of Class 1 Stock generally have
no
voting rights. Shares of Class 1 Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class A Stock acquired upon conversion. Because shares of Class 1 Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Stock, for each share of Class 1 Stock issued, we must reserve one share of Class A Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class 1 Stock. Holders of Class 1 Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors. If we pay a cash dividend on Class 1 Stock, each share of Class A Stock will receive an amount at least
10 % greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class 1 Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Stock without paying a dividend on Class 1 Stock. The number of shares of common stock issued and treasury stock, and associated share activity, are as follows: Common Stock Treasury Stock Class A Class B Class 1 Class A Class B Balance at February 28, 2022 187,263,859   28,212,340   2,248,679   22,824,607   5,005,800   Share repurchases —  —  —  4,065,508   —  Conversion of shares 655   ( 655 ) —  —  —  Exercise of stock options —  —  35   ( 108,228 ) —  Vesting of restricted stock units

billion of our publicly traded common stock, which was fully utilized during the three months ended May 31, 2022. Shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization have become treasury shares. Additionally, in January 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0
billion of our publicly traded common stock. The Board of Directors did not specify a date upon which this authorization would expire. Shares repurchased under the 2021 Authorization become treasury shares. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we repurchased
5,717,953
shares of Class A Stock pursuant to the 2018 Authorization and the 2021 Authorization at an aggregate cost of $ 1,400.5
million through a combination of open market transactions and an ASR that was announced in April 2022.

Pursuant to the Reclassification, each share of Class B Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was reclassified, exchanged, and converted into
one
share of Class A Stock and the right to receive $ 64.64
in cash, without interest. The aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock at the Effective Time was $ 1,500.0
million. We utilized our $ 1.0  billion delayed draw three-year term loan facility under the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement and borrowings under our commercial paper program to fund the aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock. The issuance of Class A Stock in connection with the Reclassification was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-4. Following the completion of the Reclassification, a number of corporate governance changes were implemented, consisting of the following: • Robert and Richard Sands, who previously served as our Executive Chairman of the Board and Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, respectively, retired from their executive positions; • Robert Sands became our Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and Richard Sands continues serving as a non-executive Board member; • the Sands Family Stockholders initially have the right to nominate two members to our Board of Directors for the next
five years
so long as they own
10 % or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Stock and to nominate one member to our Board of Directors for the next
five years
and beyond so long as they own
5 % or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Stock; • holders of Class A Stock are entitled to elect all directors to be elected at future Annual Meetings of Stockholders; and • certain standstill and lock-up provisions for the Sands Family Stockholders; limitations on the Sands Family Stockholders’, directors’, and officers’ ability to pledge our common stock; a near-term rotation of the lead independent director position; and the transition to a majority vote standard for uncontested director elections. 11.     NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CBI For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock and Class B Stock have been computed using the two-class method. For the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock has been computed using the if-converted method and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Stock as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method, until such conversion took place pursuant to the Reclassification. For the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class B Stock has been computed using the two-class method and does not assume conversion of Class B Stock into shares of Class A Stock.

three
business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy and
we report our operating results in
four
segments: (i)   Beer, (ii)   Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv)   Canopy. The Canopy Equity Method Investment
makes up the Canopy segment. If the
Canopy Transaction is completed, including conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, o ur internal management financial reporting will consist of
two
business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits and
we will report our operating results in
three
segments: (i)   Beer, (ii)   Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other. In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands, craft beer, and ABAs. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology,
as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function . All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments.
The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Long-lived tangible assets and total asset information by segment is not provided to, or reviewed by, our
CODM
as it is not used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance. Constellation Brands, Inc.

Introduction This MD&A provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. It should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2022 Annual Report. This MD&A is organized as follows: Overview.      This section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends. Strategy.      This section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of global supply chain and COVID-19 related impacts and significant divestitures, acquisitions, and investments. Results of operations.      This section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021. In addition, a brief description of significant transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided. Liquidity and capital resources.      This section provides an analysis of our cash flows, outstanding debt, and a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our on-going operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements. Overview We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, the Robert Mondavi Brand Family, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner Wine Company, and High West. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are the third-largest beer company in the U.S. and continue to strengthen our leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market. Within wine and spirits, we are making solid progress in refining our brand portfolio to shift to a higher-end focused business to deliver net sales growth and margin expansion. The strength of our brands makes us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, which include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities. Our internal management financial reporting consists of three business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy and we report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. Our
Canopy Equity Method Investment
makes up the Canopy segment. If the
Canopy Transaction is completed, including conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, o ur internal management financial reporting will consist of two
business divisions: (i) Beer
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      32 MD&A Table of Contents and (ii) Wine and Spirits and
we will report our operating results in three
segments: (i)   Beer, (ii)   Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other. In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands, craft beer, and ABAs. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a
portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands
complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology,
as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function . All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments.
The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Strategy Business strategy Our overall strategic vision is to consistently deliver industry-leading total stockholder returns over the long-term through a focus on these key pillars: • continue building strong brands people love with advantaged routes to market; • build a culture that is consumer-obsessed and leverages robust innovation capabilities to stay on the forefront of consumer trends; and • deliver on impactful ESG initiatives that we believe are not only good business, but also good for the world. We will continue to strive for success by ensuring consumer-led decision making drives all aspects of our business; building a diverse talent pipeline with best-in-class people development; investing in data systems, architecture, and infrastructure that enables our business; and exemplifying intentional and proactive balance sheet management. We place focus on positioning our portfolio on higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry to align with consumer-led premiumization trends, which we believe will continue to drive faster growth rates across beer, wine, and spirits. To continue capitalizing on consumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to organic growth and supplemented by targeted investments and acquisitions. We also believe a key component to driving faster growth rates is to invest in and strengthen our leadership position within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce channels. As a part of our strategy, we have launched Digital Business Acceleration which we believe will enable us to drive results by enhancing our business in key areas including procurement, end-to-end supply chain planning, and marketing optimization. For further information on Third Quarter 2023 and Nine Months 2023 Digital Business Acceleration investments, see the respective “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” within Results of Operations below. Our business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on upholding our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. This includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, including within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce channels, as well as continued expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities for our Mexico beer operations. Additionally, in an effort to compete more fully in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to create new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats that are intended to meet emerging needs. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      33 MD&A Table of Contents Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue under our Mexico Beer Projects to align with our anticipated future growth expectations. In April 2022, we announced that, with the assistance of the Mexican government and state and local officials in Mexico, we acquired land in Veracruz for the construction of the Veracruz Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. The design and construction process for the Veracruz Brewery is underway. Additionally, we continue to work with government officials in Mexico in connection with our canceled Mexicali Brewery construction project following a negative result from a public consultation held in Mexico. The remaining Mexicali Brewery net assets have met held for sale criteria as of November 30, 2022. Our business strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment focuses on higher-end brands, improving margins, and creating operating efficiencies. We continue to refine our portfolio primarily through an enhanced focus on higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our business is organized into two distinct commercial teams, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands. While each team has its own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to the goal of accelerating performance by growing net sales and expanding margins. In addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences. Our business continues to progressively expand into DTC channels (including hospitality), 3-tier eCommerce, and international markets, while continuing to grow in U.S. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution. In markets where it is feasible, we entered into a contractual arrangement to consolidate our U.S. distribution in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. We expect U.S. wine and spirits shipment volume to be generally aligned with depletion volume for Fiscal 2023. Marketing, sales, and distribution of our products are primarily managed on a geographic basis allowing us to leverage leading market positions. In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, ABA, and branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)   our beer portfolio and (ii)   our wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets. We complement our strategy with our investment in Canopy by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. Canopy is a leading cannabis company with operations in Canada, the U.S., Germany, and certain other global markets. This investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. Our strategic relationship with Canopy, which will continue through the completion of the Canopy Transaction including the conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, is designed to help position it to be successful in cannabis production, branding, and intellectual property. For further information on our plan to convert our Canopy common stock ownership, see “Canopy segment” below. We remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our target net leverage ratio and dividend payout ratio, invest to support the growth of our business, and deliver additional returns to stockholders through periodic share repurchases. Our results of operations and financial condition have been affected by inflation, changing prices, and reductions in discretionary income of consumers available to purchase our products, as well as other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, geopolitical events, and military conflicts, such as repercussions from the conflict in Ukraine. We expect some or all of these impacts to continue into Fiscal 2024. We intend to continue to monitor the inflationary environment and the impact on the consumer when we consider passing along rising costs through further selling price increases, subject to normal competitive conditions. In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives, including our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully mitigate rising costs through increased selling prices and/or cost savings initiatives. Furthermore, to the extent climate-related severe weather events, such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and/or late frosts, continue to occur or accelerate in future periods, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      34 MD&A Table of Contents ESG strategy We believe our ESG strategy enables us to better meet stakeholder expectations, reflect our Company values, and directly address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our communities, consumers, and employees. Specifically, we have focused on areas where we believe we have the greatest opportunities to make meaningful, positive impacts for people and the planet, and we dedicate our resources towards: Serving as good stewards of our environment and natural resources
– Modeling water stewardship for our industry; and reducing GHG emissions through energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives Enhancing social equity within our industry and communities
– Championing the professional development and advancement of women in the beverage alcohol industry and our communities; enhancing economic development and prosperity in disadvantaged communities; and c hampioning an inclusive culture within our organization, characterized by diversity in background and thought, which reflects our consumers and the communities where we live and work Promoting responsible beverage alcohol consumption
– Ensuring the responsible promotion and marketing of our products; and empowering adults to make responsible choices in their alcohol (substance) consumption by supporting fact-based education, engagement programs, and policies During Third Quarter 2023 we published our 2022 ESG Impact Report and took the following steps to advance our ESG strategy by key area: Serving as good stewards of our environment and natural resources • employees and community members came together to remove approximately 1,400 pounds of debris and recyclables from local beaches in support of the second year of Corona’s Protect Our Beaches initiative, in partnership with Oceanic Global and United by Blue Enhancing social equity within our industry and communities • supported employee-designated charitable organizations on GivingTuesday with a special match, in addition to our regular charitable matching program, providing approximately $172,000 in total donations Promoting responsible beverage alcohol consumption • in collaboration with Responsibility.org, leading up to the U.S. federal holiday, Labor Day, we continued our responsibility education efforts, sharing responsible consumption tips and information on lower-alcohol and non-alcoholic product options on our Company intranet and through our Company social media channels to help our employees and consumers make informed choices during their celebrations • together with the Corona Family of Brands, we partnered with the Washington Regional Alcohol Program and Lyft to provide safe rides home for adults celebrating Halloween in the metro-Washington area Global Supply Chain and COVID-19 Related Impacts Fiscal 2023 has been, and is expected to continue to be, impacted by challenges with both global supply chain and transportation which contributed to higher cost of product sold. For example, wine produced in New Zealand and Italy and subsequently shipped to the U.S. for distribution continues to be affected by increased costs of ocean freight shipping. In addition, during Fiscal 2022, we experienced a brown glass purchasing shortage, which impacted certain of our imported beer brands. This supply returned to normal levels in early Fiscal 2023. To the extent these circumstances continue to occur or accelerate in future periods it could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have seen consumers shift more of their total shopping spend to online channels since the COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to increased eCommerce sales, including DTC, for our business. In response to COVID-19, we have ensured our on-going liquidity and financial flexibility through cash preservation initiatives, capital management adjustments, and cost control measures. We have used opportunities under the CARES Act, afforded to us earlier in the pandemic, to defer some payments including certain payroll taxes. We believe we have
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      35 MD&A Table of Contents sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our revolving credit facility. We expect to have continued access to capital markets and to be able to continue to return value to stockholders through dividends and periodic share repurchases. Divestitures, acquisitions, and investments Wine and Spirits segment 2022 Wine Divestiture In October 2022, we sold certain of our mainstream and premium wine brands and related inventory. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of such mainstream and premium wine brands through the date of divestiture. We received cash proceeds of $96.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The net cash proceeds from the 2022 Wine Divestiture were utilized primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. We recognized a net gain of $13.8 million on the sale of business for Third Quarter 2023 and Nine Months 2023. This gain was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results. Austin Cocktails acquisition In April 2022, we acquired the remaining 73% ownership interest in Austin Cocktails, which included a portfolio of small batch, RTD cocktails. This transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill and a trademark. The results of operations of Austin Cocktails are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Lingua Franca acquisition In March 2022, we acquired the Lingua Franca business, including a collection of Oregon-based luxury wines, a vineyard, and a production facility. This transaction also includes the acquisition of a trademark and inventory. The results of operations of Lingua Franca are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. My Favorite Neighbor acquisition In November 2021, we acquired the remaining 65% ownership interest in My Favorite Neighbor, a super-luxury, DTC-focused wine business as well as certain wholesale distributed brands. This transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of My Favorite Neighbor are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Our recent divestiture and acquisitions support our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers. Canopy segment Plan to convert Canopy common stock ownership In October 2022, we entered into a Consent Agreement with Canopy pursuant to which we have provided our consent, subject to certain conditions, to the Canopy Transaction. Assuming the completion of the Canopy Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Consent Agreement and that we elect to convert our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares: • we intend to surrender our November 2018 Canopy Warrants to Canopy for cancellation; • we will only have an interest in Exchangeable Shares, which are non-voting and non-participating securities, and our remaining Canopy Debt Securities (for which we intend to negotiate an exchange of up to the full aggregate principal amount for Exchangeable Shares); • we intend to terminate all legacy agreements and commercial arrangements between ourselves and Canopy, including the investor rights agreement but excluding the Consent Agreement and certain termination agreements; • we will have no further governance rights in relation to Canopy, including rights to nominate members to the board of directors of Canopy, or approval rights related to certain transactions; Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      36 MD&A Table of Contents • all of our nominees will resign from the board of directors of Canopy; and • as our investment in Canopy common shares makes up our Canopy Equity Method Investment, we expect to no longer: ◦ apply the equity method to our investment in Canopy, which we expect to instead be accounted for at fair value with changes reported in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results; and ◦ have a stand-alone Canopy operating segment as Canopy’s financial results will no longer be provided to, or reviewed by, our
CODM
and will not be used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance. For additional information, refer to Notes 7 and 13. Impairment of Canopy Equity Method Investment We evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment as of August 31, 2022, and determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended June 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis permissibility. As a result, the Canopy Equity Method Investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. This loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for Nine Months 2023. Canopy investment In July 2022, we received 29.2 million common shares of Canopy following the exchange of C$100.0 million principal amount of our Canopy Debt Securities. This exchange did not significantly change our Canopy ownership percentage. For additional information on these divestitures, acquisitions, and investments refer to Notes 4, 5, 7, and 13. Results of Operations Financial Highlights References to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of the 2022 Wine Divestiture, as appropriate. Third Quarter 2023 compared to Third Quarter 2022 • Our results of operations were negatively impacted by (i) an increase in equity in losses from Canopy’s results, (ii) an increase in Beer media investments, (iii) an increase in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, driven by a Third Quarter 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation and Third Quarter 2023 investments in Digital Business Acceleration, and (iv) higher operational and logistics costs within both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, partially offset by (i) a decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy and (ii) improvements within the Beer segment driven by a favorable impact from pricing. • Net sales increased 5%
largely due to an increase in Beer net sales driven primarily by the favorable impact from pricing and shipment volume growth. • Operating income decreased 11%
largely due to (i) an unfavorable change in Comparable Adjustments as compared to Third Quarter 2022, (ii) the increase in Beer media investments, (iii) the increase in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, and (iv) the higher operational and logistics costs, partially offset by the improvements within the Beer segment. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      37 MD&A Table of Contents • Net income attributable to CBI and diluted net income per common share attributable to CBI remained relatively flat largely due to the items discussed above and higher provision for income taxes as compared to Third Quarter 2022. Nine Months 2023 compared to Nine Months 2022 • Our results of operations were impacted by (i) a decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy, (ii) an impairment of long-lived assets for Nine Months 2022 in connection with certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery, (iii) improvements within the Beer segment driven by shipment volume growth, and (iv) a decrease in inventory obsolescence within the Beer segment, driven by
a slowdown in the overall hard seltzer category in early Fiscal 2022 , partially offset by (i) an impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment, (ii) an increase in equity in losses from Canopy’s results primarily driven by their goodwill impairment, (iii) higher operational and logistics costs within both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, (iv) an increase in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, driven by Digital Business Acceleration investments and the Third Quarter 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation, and (v) an increase in Beer media investments. • Net sales increased 11%
largely due to an increase in Beer net sales driven primarily by shipment volume growth and favorable impact from pricing. • Operating income increased 44%
largely due to (i) the impact of the impairment of long-lived assets in connection with certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery for Nine Months 2022 and (ii) improvements within the Beer segment, including the decrease in inventory obsolescence, partially offset by (i) the higher operational and logistics costs, (ii) the increase in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, and (iii) the increase in Beer media investments. • Net loss attributable to CBI and diluted net loss per common share attributable to CBI decreased largely due to the items discussed above, partially offset by higher provision for income taxes. Comparable Adjustments Management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and the incentive compensation of segment management are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss) which does not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.

At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility. Net flow through of reserved inventory We sold reserved inventory previously written down following the 2020 U.S. wildfires. Selling, general, and administrative expenses Gain on sale of business We recognized a net gain on the completion of the 2022 Wine Divestiture (Third Quarter 2023, Nine Months 2023). Costs associated with the Reclassification We recognized costs primarily related to professional and consulting fees, printing and mailing the associated proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Reclassification. For additional information, refer to Note 10. Transition services agreements activity We recognized costs in connection with transition services agreements related to the previous sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business.

The decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales is due to $17.4 million from the 2022 Wine Divestiture and a $6.0 million decrease in organic net sales. The decrease in organic net sales is driven by (i) a $53.5 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume partially offset by $50.5 million of favorable product mix both of which are attributable to the consumer-led premiumization and mix improvements of our portfolio. The decrease in organic net sales was also affected by an unfavorable impact from pricing, driven by increases in promotional activity, largely offset by price increases and a contractual distributor payment. For the remainder of Fiscal 2023, we expect U.S. depletion volume to exceed U.S. shipment volume. Canopy segment Our ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method.
Amounts included for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy’s reported results
on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy’s earnings (losses) for the periods (i) July through September 2022, in our Third Quarter 2023 results, (ii) July through September 2021, in our Third Quarter 2022, (iii) January through September  2022, in our

Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      41 MD&A Table of Contents The increase in Beer gross profit is primarily due to (i) the $77.0 million favorable impact from pricing, (ii) $24.9 million of shipment volume growth, and (iii) a $6.9 million increase from favorable product mix, partially offset by $79.3 million of higher cost of product sold. The higher cost of product sold is largely due to (i) $52.1 million of higher material costs, including glass, aluminum, malt, cartons, corn, steel, and pallets, driven by inflation and global supply chain constraints, (ii) $15.7 million of increased transportation costs, (iii) an $11.9 million increase in brewery costs primarily driven by increased utilities, maintenance, and administrative costs, and (iv) $3.6 million of higher depreciation resulting from the Mexico Beer Projects, partially offset by $7.9 million of favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels as compared to
Third Quarter 2022 . The decrease in Wine and Spirits gross profit is due to a decrease of $11.8 million from the 2022 Wine Divestiture, partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in organic gross profit. The increase in organic gross profit is attributable to a $40.3 million increase from favorable product mix, partially offset by (i) a $25.6 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume and (ii) $12.3 million of higher cost of product sold. The increase in cost of product sold was largely attributable to (i) $6.4 million of increased transportation costs, including ocean freight shipping, (ii) $5.5 million related to an out of period inventory adjustment, and (iii) $2.5 million of higher material costs, including glass and packaging materials, partially offset by lower warehousing costs and net favorable fixed cost absorption primarily as a result of the
Third Quarter 2022
impact of a late frost in New Zealand. Gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 50.4% for Third Quarter 2023 compared with 52.8% for Third Quarter 2022.
This decrease was largely due to (i) approximately 315 basis points and 50 basis points of rate declines from cost of product sold within the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, respectively, driven by the increase in operational and logistics costs and (ii) an unfavorable change of approximately 95 basis points in Comparable Adjustments, partially offset by (i) approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from Beer pricing in select markets and (ii) approximately 55 basis points of favorable impact from product mix shift within the Wine and Spirits segment.

The increase in marketing spend is due largely to a timing shift for media to the second half of Fiscal 2023 and increased sports-related partnerships to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio.
We continue to expect marketing spend to range from 9% to 10% of net sales for Fiscal 2023. The increase in g eneral and administrative expenses was driven primarily by (i) higher compensation and benefits, primarily related to incremental headcount to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio, and (ii) increased legal expenses, largely offset by (i) favorable foreign currency impact and (ii) decreased demolition costs for the Mexico Beer Projects and professional fees as compared to Third Quarter 2022. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      42 MD&A Table of Contents The increase in Wine and Spirits selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily due to $11.3 million of increased general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $6.2 million decrease in marketing spend. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely driven by (i) compensation and benefits, primarily related to higher headcount from our continued focus on expanding into DTC channels and higher-end brands as compared to Third Quarter 2022, (ii) expenses associated with an initiative to improve our marketing effectiveness, and (iii) higher travel as compared to Third Quarter 2022 , partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact .
We continue to expect marketing spend to range from 9% to 10% of net sales for Fiscal 2023. The increase in Corporate Operations and Other selling, general, and administrative expenses is largely due to approximately (i) a $14 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily related to a Third Quarter 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation for a performance award tied to earnings from our investment in Canopy that did not achieve a threshold level of performance and (ii) a $13 million increase in third-party services, driven by Digital Business Acceleration investments. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 19.7% for Third Quarter 2023 as compared to 16.6% for Third Quarter 2022 . The increase is largely driven by (i) approximately 125 basis points of rate growth from an increase in the Corporate Operations and Other segment’s selling, general, and administrative expenses, (ii) approximately 95 basis points of rate growth as the increase in Beer selling, general, and administrative expenses exceeded the increase in net sales, (iii) an unfavorable change in Comparable Adjustments, contributing approximately 65 basis points of rate growth, and (iv) 20 basis points of rate growth from the increase in Wine and Spirits’ selling, general, and administrative expenses.

The decrease in Wine and Spirits operating income is largely attributable to the decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, the increase in cost of product sold, the 2022 Wine Divestiture, and increased general and administrative expenses, as described above, partially offset by the favorable product mix shift and the lower marketing spend. As previously discussed, the Corporate Operations and Other increase in operating loss is largely due to increased compensation and benefits, driven by the Third Quarter 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation, and the Third Quarter 2023 Digital Business Acceleration investments.

This decrease of $14.1 million, or 14%, is largely attributable to lower cannabis sales, partially offset by growth in their BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc. business. The decline in cannabis sales primarily resulted from decreases in (i) Canadian recreational cannabis sales volume, largely driven by continuing impacts of price compression resulting from increased competition and from Canopy’s strategic decision to shift their focus to premium and mainstream products and (ii) medicinal sales driven by the January 2022 divestiture of C 3 , an international pharmaceutical business.
Canopy gross profit (loss) increased to $2.9 million for Third Quarter 2023 from $(56.5) million for Third Quarter 2022. This increase of $59.4 million is primarily driven by a net decrease in inventory write-downs as compared to Third Quarter 2022, partially offset by (i) decreased net sales and price compression in the Canadian recreational channel, (ii) unfavorable product mix shift, and (iii) a decrease in payroll subsidies received from the Canadian government in Third Quarter 2022 pursuant to a COVID-19 relief program. Canopy selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $23.0 million driven by higher asset impairment charges and restructuring costs as compared to Third Quarter 2022.
The combination of these factors were the main contributors to the decrease in operating loss of $36.4 million. Interest expense Interest expense increased to $98.7 million for Third Quarter 2023 as compared to $88.0 million for Third Quarter 2022. This increase of $10.7 million, or 12%, is due to higher average borrowings of approximately $640 million and approximately 30 basis points of higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest in connection with the Mexico Beer Projects. (Provision for) benefit from income taxes The provision for income taxes increased to $131.1 million for Third Quarter 2023 from $99.3 million for Third Quarter 2022. Our effective tax rate for Third Quarter 2023 was 21.5% as compared with 17.1% for Third Quarter 2022. In comparison to prior year, our income taxes were impacted primarily by: • a higher net income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for Third Quarter 2022 from changes in option exercise activity; partially offset by • an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy. For additional information, refer to Note 9. Net income (loss) attributable to CBI Net income (loss) attributable to CBI decreased to $467.7 million for Third Quarter 2023 from $470.8 million for Third Quarter 2022. This decrease of $3.1 million is largely attributable to (i) higher operational and logistics costs within both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, (ii) the increase in equity in losses from Canopy’s results, (iii) the increase in Beer media investments, and (iv) the increases in the provision for income taxes and Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (i) the decrease

19.2% for Nine Months 2023 as compared with 18.7% for Nine Months 2022. The increase is driven largely by (i) approximately 55 basis points of rate growth from the increase in the Corporate Operations and Other segment’s selling, general, and administrative expenses, (ii) an unfavorable change in Comparable Adjustments, contributing 35 basis points of rate growth,
and (iii) approximately 15 basis points of rate growth from the increase in Wine and Spirits selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of rate decline as the increase in Beer net sales exceeded the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

The decrease in Wine and Spirits operating income is largely attributable to the increases in cost of product sold and general and administrative expenses, as described above, the decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, and the 2022 Wine Divestiture, partially offset by the favorable product mix shift, increase in non-branded net sales, the favorable pricing impact, and lower marketing spend. As previously discussed, the Corporate Operations and Other increase in operating loss is largely due to the Nine Months 2023 Digital Business Acceleration investments and increased compensation and benefits, driven by the Third Quarter 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation, partially offset by the decrease in ERP-related consulting services.

Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      48 MD&A Table of Contents Canopy segment Canopy net sales decreased to $264.7 million for Nine Months 2023 from $332.4 million for Nine Months 2022. This decrease of $67.7 million, or 20%, is largely attributable to lower cannabis sales, partially offset by growth in their BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc. business. The decline in cannabis sales primarily resulted from decreases in (i) Canadian recreational cannabis sales volume, largely driven by Canopy’s strategic decision to shift their focus to premium and mainstream products and the continuing impacts of price compression resulting from increased competition and (ii) medicinal sales driven by the January 2022 divestiture of C 3 , partially offset by growth in Canadian THC recreational sales driven by Canopy’s Fiscal 2022 acquisitions including the Supreme Cannabis Company, Inc. Additionally, other consumer products sales in Nine Months 2023 as compared to Nine Months 2022 decreased driven by declines in their Storz & Bickel GmbH & Co. KG and This Works Products Limited businesses. Canopy gross profit (loss) decreased to $(123.9) million for Nine Months 2023 from $(26.6) million for Nine Months 2022. This decrease of $97.3 million is primarily driven by (i) a net increase in inventory write-downs as compared to Nine Months 2022, (ii) decreased net sales and price compression in the Canadian recreational channel, (iii) unfavorable product mix shift, and (iv) a decrease in payroll subsidies received from the Canadian government in Nine Months 2022 pursuant to a COVID-19 relief program. Canopy selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $1,387.3 million largely driven by a $1,353.2 million goodwill impairment related to their cannabis operations, restructuring costs, and asset impairments for Nine Months 2023, partially offset by a continued focus on reducing costs and the closure of certain research and development facilities in Fiscal 2022. The combination of these factors were the main contributors to the $1,484.6 million increase in operating loss. Interest expense Interest expense increased to $281.5 million for Nine Months 2023 as compared to $270.5 million for Nine Months 2022. This increase of $11.0 million, or 4%, is due to higher average borrowings of approximately $355 million and approximately 10 basis points of higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest in connection with the Mexico Beer Projects. Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of a premium payment and the write-off of debt issuance costs in connection with the May 2022 tender offers of our 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes (Nine Months 2023) and make-whole payments in connection with the early redemption of our (i) 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes (Nine Months 2023) and (ii) 2.70% May 2017 Senior Notes and 2.65% November 2017 Senior Notes (Nine Months 2022). (Provision for) benefit from income taxes The provision for income taxes increased to $388.9 million for Nine Months 2023 from $217.1 million for Nine Months 2022. Our effective tax rate for Nine Months 2023 was 305.7% as compared with (115.8)% for Nine Months 2022. In comparison to prior year, our income taxes were impacted primarily by: • an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy; and • the effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, including the impact of the Nine Months 2022 long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress; partially offset by • a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture; and • a higher net income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for Nine Months 2022 from changes in option exercise activity. For additional information, refer to Note 9. We expect our reported effective tax rate for Fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 73% to 75%. Since estimates are not currently available, this range does not reflect any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investment measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      49 MD&A Table of Contents Net income (loss) attributable to CBI Net loss attributable to CBI decreased to $294.0 million for Nine Months 2023 from $435.8 million for Nine Months 2022.
This
decrease
of $141.8 million, or 33%, is largely attributable to (i) a decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy, (ii) the impairment of long-lived assets for Nine Months 2022 in connection with certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery, and (iii) the improvements within the Beer segment, partially offset by (i) the impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment, (ii) the increase in equity losses from Canopy’s results, and (iii) the increase in the provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among other things. We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs. The Reclassification required significant cash outlays during Third Quarter 2023. Pursuant to the Reclassification, each share of Class B Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was reclassified, exchanged, and converted into one share of Class A Stock and received $64.64 in cash, without interest. The aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock at the Effective Time was $1,500.0 million. We utilized our $1.0 billion three-year term loan facility under the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement and borrowings under our commercial paper program to fund the aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock. In addition, we have incurred $31.5 million of non-recurring costs and expenses for Nine Months 2023 in connection with the completion of the Reclassification. We do not expect the Reclassification to have an ongoing material impact on our liquidity. We have an agreement with a financial institution for payable services and began to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution during Third Quarter 2023. The program is available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program. Our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. As of November 30, 2022, the amount payable to this participating financial institution for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the supply chain finance program was $0.2 million and was included in accounts payable within our consolidated balance sheet. The amount settled through the supply chain finance program and paid to the financial institution was $4.3 million during Third Quarter 2023. We account for payments made under the supply chain finance program the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flow from operating activities. Constellation Brands, Inc.

These changes were partially offset by the timing of collections for (i) recoverable value-added taxes for the Beer segment and (ii) accounts receivable for both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities benefited from lower income tax payments in Nine Months 2023 as compared to Nine Months 2022. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $646.6 million for Nine Months 2023 from $674.2 million for Nine Months 2022. This decrease of $27.6 million, or 4%, was primarily due to (i) $92.1 million of higher proceeds from sale of business, driven by the 2022 Wine Divestiture, and (ii) $16.4 million of lower business acquisitions, partially offset by $85.1 million of higher capital expenditures for Nine Months 2023.

This increase consisted of: Debt repayment Debt issuance Bank facilities In October 2022, we entered into the October 2022 Credit Agreement Amendments which revise certain defined terms and covenants in our credit agreements. These amendments will become effective upon (i) the amendment by Canopy of its Articles of Incorporation, (ii) the conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, and (iii) the resignation of our nominees from the board of directors of Canopy. In August 2022, we entered into the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement. The August 2022 Term Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion three-year term loan facility and is not subject to amortization payments, with the balance due and payable on November 10, 2025. In April 2022, we entered into the 2022 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated our then-existing senior credit facility. The 2022 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) the refinance and increase of the
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      52 MD&A Table of Contents existing revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and extension of its maturity to April 14, 2027, (ii) the refinement of certain negative covenants, and (iii) the replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR. There are no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement. In April 2022, the Company and the Administrative Agent and Lender amended the June 2021 Term Credit Agreement. The principal changes effected by the April 2022 amendment were the refinement of certain negative covenants and replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR. Senior notes In May 2022, we issued the May 2022 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $1,837.1 million were used towards a series of cash tender offers, the June 2022 repayment of the 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and the 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, funding capital expenditures, retirement of debt, and other business opportunities. General The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of November 30, 2022, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2024 to calendar 2050, and a variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facility under our April 2022 Term Credit Agreement and August 2022 Term Credit Agreement with calendar 2024 and 2025 maturity dates, respectively. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion of commercial paper, inclusive of a $250.0 million increase implemented in December 2022. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we intend to utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. We had the following remaining borrowing capacity available under our 2022 Credit Agreement: November 30, 2022 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Revolving credit facility

The financial institutions participating in our 2022 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so. We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in our 2022 Credit Agreement, the April 2022 Term Credit Agreement, and the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2022 Credit Agreement. As of November 30, 2022, under our 2022 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.0x. Constellation Brands, Inc.

As a result of our global operating, investment, acquisition, divestiture, and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we periodically purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap contracts, interest rate swap contracts, and Pre-issuance hedge contracts. We use derivative instruments to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates, as well as to hedge economic exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign currency and commodity price risk Foreign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with investments, acquisitions, or divestitures outside the U.S. As of November 30, 2022, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, New Zealand dollar, and Canadian dollar. Approximately 100% of our balance sheet exposures and 87% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the remaining three months of Fiscal 2023 were hedged as of November 30, 2022. Commodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges. As of November 30, 2022, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, and natural gas prices. Approximately 88% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the remaining three months of Fiscal 2023 were hedged as of November 30, 2022. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Gains or losses from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or losses on the derivative instruments. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows: Aggregate Notional Value Fair Value, Net Asset (Liability) Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value – Hypothetical 10% Adverse Change November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 (in millions) Foreign currency contracts $ 2,766.3  $ 2,244.8  $ 172.1  $ (50.8) $ (191.3) $ 156.4  Commodity derivative contracts $ 341.1  $ 243.5  $ 45.0  $ 41.7  $ (34.3) $ (26.5) Interest rate risk The estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily SOFR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt. There were no cash flow designated or undesignated interest rate swap contracts or Pre-issuance hedge contracts outstanding as of November 30, 2022, or November 30, 2021. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates. The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      58 OTHER KEY INFORMATION Table of Contents The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including current maturities, are summarized as follows: Aggregate Notional Value Fair Value, Net Asset (Liability) Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value –
Hypothetical 1% Rate Increase November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 (in millions) Fixed interest rate debt $ 10,077.8  $ 9,868.5  $ (9,205.0) $ (10,695.5) $ (620.2) $ (818.9) A 1% hypothetical change in the prevailing interest rates would have increased interest expense on our variable interest rate debt by $6.6 million and $3.6 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, respectively. Equity price risk The estimated fair value of our investment in the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and the Canopy Debt Securities are subject to equity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. This investment is recognized at fair value utilizing various option-pricing models and has the potential to fluctuate from, among other items, changes in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. We manage our equity price risk exposure by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance, and outlook of Canopy. As of November 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment in the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and the Canopy Debt Securities was $74.7 million, with an unrealized net gain (loss) on this investment of $(39.1) million recognized in our results of operations for the nine months ended November 30, 2022. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of the equity price reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. As of November 30, 2022, such a hypothetical 10% adverse change would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $1.6 million. For additional discussion on our market risk, refer to Notes 3 and 4. Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal control over financial reporting In connection with the foregoing evaluation by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, no changes were identified in the Company’s “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      59 OTHER KEY INFORMATION Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION I tem 1. Legal Proceedings. For additional information regarding Legal Proceedings, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report. The risk factors associated with our business have not materially changed compared to the risk factors disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report except for the updated risk factors below. The risk factors described below and the additional risks described in the 2022 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations in present and/or future periods. Operational Risks Marijuana is currently illegal under U.S. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control Canopy’s business or operations; the Canopy Transaction, which is designed to capitalize on U.S. cannabis market opportunities, may significantly alter our relationship with and investment in Canopy The ability of Canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, Canopy’s compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and Canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products. The laws and regulations governing medicinal and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. Canopy’s success will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to operate successfully in the cannabis market space and the presence of sufficient retail outlets. There are also concerns about health issues associated with certain types of form factors for cannabis products, such as those used in inhalables. These issues may result in a less robust consumer demand for certain form factors. A robust cannabis consumer market may not develop consistent with our expectations, or consumers may choose not to purchase any Canopy products. Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the U.S. and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law. Even in those U.S. states in which the recreational and/or medicinal use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of U.S. federal law. Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana could limit the expansion of Canopy’s business into the U.S. Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or negatively impact Canopy’s markets, products, and sales initiatives. We currently have the right to nominate four members of the Canopy board of directors. While we do not control Canopy’s business or operations, we do rely on Canopy’s internal controls and procedures for operation of that business. Nevertheless, our current financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i) Canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with Canadian laws in all material respects; (ii) Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import, and/or sell marijuana, or any other controlled substance in or from the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation, or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules, and regulations; and (iii) Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, sale, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules, and regulations. If Canopy were to knowingly or intentionally violate any of these applicable laws and we became aware of such violation, we would
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      60 OTHER KEY INFORMATION Table of Contents be unable to make the required certification under our current financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements. If the Canopy Transaction is completed and we exchange our Canopy common shares for Exchangeable Shares and terminate certain legacy agreements with Canopy, we and Canopy will no longer be able to derive benefits from our strategic relationship. The Exchangeable Shares will not carry (i) voting rights, which will limit our ability to exert influence over Canopy (as will the termination of our rights under the investor rights agreement and the resignations of our nominees to Canopy’s board of directors), or (ii) rights to receive dividends or other rights upon dissolution of Canopy, which will limit our right to derive economic benefits from our investment in Canopy if it declares dividends or dissolves and we continue to hold Exchangeable Shares. Furthermore, we expect to no longer apply the equity method to our investment in Canopy, which may subject our financial statements to additional volatility as we expect to account for the Exchangeable Shares at fair value. In connection with an exchange of our Canopy common shares for Exchangeable Shares, we will also surrender our November 2018 Canopy Warrants to Canopy for cancellation, and therefore, we will not realize an opportunity to increase our ownership in Canopy if its stock price were to recover prior to their expiration. The perception of the Canopy Transaction by members of the investment community, whether or not it is completed, and the potential that Canopy may not remain listed on the stock exchanges it is currently listed on may result in a decrease in the value of Canopy’s common stock and further impair its liquidity and marketability. If the Canopy Transaction is not completed for any reason, including if Canopy fails to receive the requisite shareholder approval for the Canopy Amendment, Canopy will have expended substantial time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on Canopy’s existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Canopy. Canopy may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Canopy Transaction if it is completed. To the extent any of the foregoing factors impact Canopy, it could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment in Canopy. If the October 2022 Credit Agreement Amendments become effective, our financing arrangements will (i) restrict repayment of the loans under our credit agreements with proceeds derived, directly or indirectly, from Canopy prior to the Specified Time, (ii) restrict the use of proceeds from the loans under our credit agreements, directly or indirectly, for any investment in, transaction with, or to fund the activities of or business with Canopy prior to the Specified Time, and (iii) provide that we will not convert any of our outstanding Exchangeable Shares for Canopy common shares or own any Canopy common shares until the Specified Time. Additionally, we will no longer be required to make the certifications with respect to Canopy provided under our current financing arrangements. If the foregoing obligations become effective and we do not comply with them, we could trigger an event of default under such debt facilities or agreements. In such an event, the holders of our debt could elect to declare as due and payable all amounts outstanding under those instruments. An event of default could also result in events of default under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, which could permit counterparties thereunder to exercise remedies. If that occurred, we might not have available funds to satisfy our repayment obligations. Strategic Risks Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numerous trademark registrations and use certain trademarks under license covering our brands and products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file or have filed on our behalf, trademark applications seeking to protect newly developed brands and products. We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of such trademark applications. We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate, or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. As previously disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report, our subsidiaries CB Brand Strategies, LLC, Crown Imports LLC, and Compañía Cervecera de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V. are defendants in a lawsuit originally filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2021, and most recently amended on March 16, 2022, by Cervecería Modelo de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Trademarks Grupo Modelo, S. de R.L. de C.V., which alleges, among other things, that our sublicense of the trademarks for our Mexican beer brands should
Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      61 OTHER KEY INFORMATION Table of Contents not permit us to use the Corona brand name on our Corona Hard Seltzer or the Modelo brand name on our Modelo Ranch Water. On August 5, 2022, both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On November 3, 2022, the court denied our motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. On December 19, 2022, the court issued an order setting certain pretrial deadlines and providing that the court is “considering a trial starting in March 2023.” While we continue to believe this lawsuit is without merit, litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable developments and resolutions could occur. In addition, our cost of defending this litigation could be substantial. If we are not successful, we may not be able to market Corona Hard Seltzer in its current formulation under the Corona brand name or Modelo Ranch Water in its current formulation under the Modelo brand name and we may be required to pay damage awards, each of which may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We may be subject to other litigation related to our trademarks and intellectual property rights. A substantial adverse judgment or other unfavorable resolution of these matters or our failure to otherwise protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Financial Risks Securities measured at fair value The value of the warrants and debt securities we hold in Canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock. This volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility. The market price of Canopy’s common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of Canopy, or of us. These factors include, but are not limited to: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in Canopy’s reported results of operations or financial position, including due to another significant impairment of goodwill or intangible or other long-lived assets; • adverse market conditions; • recommendations and reports by securities and industry analysts; • impact of COVID-19 on Canopy’s operations, revenues, and ability to access financial markets as well as, on the cannabis industry generally; • the outcome of the Canopy Transaction and related transactions; • significant acquisitions, investments, equity issuances, asset sales, and/or other divestitures by Canopy; • changes in the performance or market valuations of companies in Canopy’s industry; • announcement of developments and material events by Canopy or its competitors; • fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services; • addition or departure of Canopy executive officers or other key personnel; • speculative trading activity by certain investors; • news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological, or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in Canopy’s industry or target markets; • legal and regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and Canopy’s business and operations; and • administrative obligations associated with Health Canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the Canadian
Cannabis Act . We currently account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. There may be a future impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if our expectations about Canopy’s prospective results and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including those listed above. We currently recognize our equity in Canopy’s earnings on a two-month lag primarily because of the availability of Canopy’s financial results since Canopy’s fiscal year ends annually March 31 while our fiscal year ends annually on the last day of February. In the event the Canopy Transaction is completed and we convert our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, we expect to account for the Exchangeable Shares at fair value, which may subject our financial statements to additional volatility because the value of the Exchangeable Shares would be subject to similar volatility factors as the warrants and debt securities we currently hold in Canopy. Constellation Brands, Inc. Q3 FY 2023 Form 10-Q #WORTHREACHINGFOR     I      62 OTHER KEY INFORMATION Table of Contents Other Risks The Reclassification may not benefit us or our stockholders The long-term impacts of the Reclassification are still unknown, and the Reclassification may not result in an increase in stockholder value or improve the liquidity and marketability of our equity. If the Reclassification is not viewed favorably by members of the investment community, it may cause a decrease in the value of our Class A Stock and impair its liquidity and marketability. Furthermore, securities markets worldwide have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could cause a reduction in the market price and liquidity of shares of our Class A Stock. Sands Family Stockholder Class A Stock ownership and Board of Directors nomination rights Until the date that is five years after the Effective Time and so long as the Sands Family Stockholders, collectively, have beneficial or record ownership of at least 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Stock, our Board of Directors will, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in the Reclassification Agreement, nominate two individuals designated by WildStar for election to the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of our stockholders at which directors are to be elected (or otherwise in connection with any action by written consent pursuant to which a majority of the Board of Directors will be elected). So long as the Sands Family Stockholders, collectively, have beneficial or record ownership of less than 10% but at least 9,239,463.1 shares of Class A Stock, as adjusted by any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or similar transaction, the Board of Directors will, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in the Reclassification Agreement, nominate one individual designated by WildStar for election to the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of our stockholders at which directors are to be elected (or otherwise in connection with any action by written consent pursuant to which a majority of the Board of Directors will be elected). The amount of Class A Stock currently held by the Sands Family Stockholders, together with the foregoing Board of Directors nomination rights, provide the Sands Family Stockholders with significant continued influence over the Company’s decisions. The interests of the Sands Family Stockholders with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting the Company and its other stockholders, such as future acquisitions, financings, and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire the Company, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. The Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family have pledged shares of Class A Stock to secure various credit facilities. In the event of noncompliance with certain covenants under the credit facilities, the financial institutions to which such stock is pledged have certain remedies, including the right to sell the pledged shares subject to certain protections afforded to the borrowers and pledgors. The sale by such financial institutions of a substantial amount of the pledged shares could depress, or result in volatility in, the trading price of our Class A Stock. Item 5.    Other Information. On November 10, 2022, our Board of Directors amended and restated our by-laws to implement certain conforming changes in connection with the Amended and Restated Charter and certain other changes to update the Amended and Restated By-Laws in accordance with best corporate practices. The amendments, among other things, include: • a requirement that stockholders nominating directors to the Board of Directors certify their compliance with the SEC’s universal proxy rules; and • revisions to the advance notice requirements for stockholders making director nominations, including (i) establishing clear eligibility requirements for requesting our director and officer questionnaire and other nomination materials and providing that we have five business days to respond to such requests and (ii) enhancing our ability to request supplemental information from Board of Director nominees after the nomination deadline.
