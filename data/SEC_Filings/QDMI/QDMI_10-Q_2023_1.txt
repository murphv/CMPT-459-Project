CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”),
including, without limitation, statements under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,”
“estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,”
“will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,”
or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. There can be no assurance that actual results will not
materially differ from expectations. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, but actual results may differ
materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to:
●
the impact (including travel
and entry restrictions and quarantine) of public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Hong Kong and the rest of
the world, on the market we operate in and our business, results of operations and financial condition;
●
the impact of political uncertainty
and social unrest in Hong Kong and laws, rules and regulations of the Chinese government aimed at addressing such unrest;
●
the market for our services
in Hong Kong and Mainland China;
●
our expansion and other plans
and opportunities;
●
our future financial and operating
results, including revenues, income, expenditures, cash balances and other financial items;
●
current and future economic
conditions in Hong Kong and China;
●
the future growth of the Hong
Kong insurance industry as a whole and the professional insurance intermediary sector in particular;
●
our ability to attract customers,
further enhance our brand recognition;
●
our ability to hire and retain
qualified management personnel and key employees in order to enable them to develop our business;
●
changes in other applicable
laws or regulations in Hong Kong related to or that could impact our business;
●
our management of business
through a U.S. publicly-traded and reporting company and the general reputation and potential scrutiny of U.S. publicly-traded companies
with their principal operations in Hong Kong and China; and
●
other assumptions regarding
or descriptions of potential future events or circumstances described in this Report underlying or relating to any forward-looking statements.
ii
The forward-looking statements contained in this Report
are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments
affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some
of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any
of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution
you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Report. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments
in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, those results or developments
may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

QDM International Inc.
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements
1.
Organization and principal activities
QDM International Inc. (“QDM,” and collectively
with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida in March 2020 and is the successor to 24/7 Kid Doc, Inc.
(“24/7 Kid”), which was incorporated in Florida in November 1998. The Company conducts its business through an indirectly
wholly owned subsidiary, YeeTah Insurance Consultant Limited (“YeeTah”), a licensed insurance brokerage company located in
Hong Kong, China. YeeTah sells a wide range of insurance products, consisting of two major categories: (1) life and medical insurance,
such as individual life insurance; and (2) general insurance, such as automobile insurance, commercial property insurance, liability insurance,
homeowner insurance. In addition, as a Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) Intermediary, YeeTah also assists its customers with
their investment through the MPF and the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance schemes (“ORSO”) in Hong Kong, both of
which are retirement protection schemes set up for employees.
On October 21, 2020, the Company entered into a share
exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with QDM Holdings Limited, a BVI company (“QDM BVI”), and
Huihe Zheng, the sole shareholder of QDM BVI (the “QDM BVI Shareholder”), who is also the Company’s principal stockholder,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of QDM BVI in exchange for the issuance
to the QDM BVI Shareholder 30,000 shares ( 900,000
shares before the Reverse Split (as defined below)) of a newly designated Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), with each Series C Preferred Stock initially
being convertible into 11 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share, subject to certain adjustments and
limitations (the “Share Exchange”). The Share Exchange closed on October 21, 2020.
As a result of the consummation of the Share Exchange,
the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of QDM BVI and its subsidiaries, QDM Group Limited, a Hong Kong corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of QDM BVI (“QDM HK”) and YeeTah.
The Company was a shell company prior to the reverse
acquisition which occurred as a result of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and QDM BVI
was a private operating company. The reverse acquisition by a non-operating public shell company of a private operating company typically
results in the owners and management of the private company having actual or effective voting and operating control of the combined company.
Therefore, the reverse acquisition is considered a capital transaction in substance. In other words, the transaction is a reverse recapitalization,
equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private company for the net monetary assets of the shell company accompanied by a recapitalization.
Therefore, the acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization and QDM BVI is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of QDM BVI have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.
Accordingly, the reverse acquisition has been treated
as a corporate restructuring (reorganization) of entities under common control and thus the current capital structures of QDM BVI and
its wholly-owned subsidiary QDM HK and its wholly-owned subsidiary, YeeTah, have been retrospectively presented in prior periods as if
such structures existed at that time and in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.
As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company ceased
to be a shell company.
5
On November 3, 2021, the
Company acquired  100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of QDMI Software Group Limited (“QDMS”), a company incorporated
on February 6, 2020 in Cyprus. The Company acquired QDMS through an intermediary holding company, Lutter Global Limited (“LGL”),
which was incorporated on July 29, 2021 in the BVI. Before the acquisition, Huihe Zheng was the sole shareholder of QDMS. As part of the
acquisition, Mr. Zheng sold all the shares of QDMS to LGL for a consideration of EUR5,000 in November 2021 and at the same time the sole
shareholder of LGL, Mengting Xu, transferred all her shares in LGL to the Company for a consideration of USD$1.00. As a result, the Company
acquired a 100% ownership of LGL, which, in turn, owns 100% of QDMS. Accordingly, the acquisition has been treated as a corporate restructuring
(reorganization) of entities under common control and thus the current capital structures of QDMS and LGL have been retrospectively presented
in prior periods as if such structures existed at that time and in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.
Going Concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course
of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit as of December
31, 2022. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating revenue and profit in the future and/or to obtain necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve
months primarily through financings from the Company’s major stockholder, although the Company may seek other sources of funding,
including public and private offerings of securities.
These consolidated financial statements do not
reflect adjustments that would be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a “going concern.” While
management believes that the actions already taken or planned, including adjusting its operating expenditures and obtaining
financial supports from its principal stockholder, will mitigate the adverse conditions and events which raise doubt about the
validity of the “going concern” assumption used in preparing these financial statements, there can be no assurance that
these actions will be successful. If the Company were unable to continue as a “going concern,” then substantial
adjustments would be necessary to the reported amounts of its liabilities and assets, the reported expenses and the consolidated balance sheet
classifications used.
2.
Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”). The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items,
which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2022.
6
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated
financial statements in conformity with the U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The reported
amounts of revenues and expenses may be affected by the estimates that management is required to make. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Foreign Currency and Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s reporting currency is the United
States Dollar (“US$” or “$”). The Company’s operations are principally conducted in Hong Kong where Hong
Kong dollar is the functional currency. The functional currency of the Company’s two subsidiaries, Lutter Global Limited and QDMI
Software Group Limited, is the Euro.
Transactions denominated in other than the functional
currencies are re-measured into the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currencies are translated into the functional currency
at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are reported in the statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.
The exchanges rates used for translation from Hong
Kong dollar to US$ was
7.8000 , a pegged rate determined by the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong. This pegged rate was used to
translate Company’s balance sheets, income statement items and cash flow items for both the three and nine months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021.
The exchanges rates used for translation from Euro
to US$ are as follows:
Schedule of exchange rates
December
31, 2022
December
31, 2021
Period-end
spot rate
EUR
1 = US$ 1.0698
EUR
1 = US$ 1.1318
Average
rate for nine months period
EUR
1 = US$ 1.0310
EUR
1 = US$ 1.1762
Certain Risks and Concentration
The Company’s financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables, and other
assets. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held in major financial institutions
located in Hong Kong, which management considers to being of high credit quality.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash on
hand and cash held in banks, which are highly liquid and have original maturities of three months or less and are unrestricted as to withdrawal
or use.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable represents trade receivable and
are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment.
7
The Company makes impairment loss for bad and doubtful
debts based on assessments of the recoverability of the trade and other receivables based on individual account analysis, including the
current creditworthiness and the past collection history of each debtor. Impairments arise when there is an objective evidence indicate
that the balances may not be collectible. The identification of bad and doubtful debts, in particular of a loss event, requires the use
of judgment and estimates, which involve the estimates of specific losses on individual exposures, as well as a provision on historical
trends of collections. Based on management of customers’ credit and ongoing relationship, management makes conclusions whether any
balances outstanding at the end of the period will be deemed uncollectible on an individual basis and on aging analysis basis. The provision
is recorded against accounts receivables balances, with a corresponding charge recorded in the statements of operations and comprehensive
loss. Delinquent account balances are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the
likelihood of collection is not probable.
The Company historically did not have material bad
debts in accounts receivable. There were no bad debt expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and there
was
no
provision for doubtful accounts as of December 31 and March 31, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue primarily by providing insurance brokerage
services in Hong Kong. The Company sells insurance products underwritten by insurance companies operating in Hong Kong to its individual
customers and is compensated for its services by commissions paid by insurance companies, typically based on a percentage of the premium
paid by the insured.
ASC 606 provides for a five-step model for recognizing
revenue from contracts with customers. These five steps include:
(i)
Identify the contract
(ii)
Identify performance obligations
(iii)
Determine transaction price
(iv)
Allocate transaction price
(v)
Recognize revenue
The Company enters into insurance brokerage contracts
with customers (insurance companies). Performance obligation for these insurance brokerage contracts is to help insurance company customers
to promote, coordinate and complete subscriptions of insurance policies offered by customers.
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when the customer
obtains control of a good or service. A customer obtains control of a good or service if it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain
substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. The transfer of control of the Company’s brokerage services
generally occurs at a point in time on the effective date of the associated insurance contract when the policy transfers to the customer.
The insurance policy entered between the insurance company and the insured customer generally contains a cool-off period of one to two
months. When the cool-off period elapses and the insured customer does not withdraw from the insurance policy, the policy becomes effective.
Once the transfer of control of a service occurs, the Company has satisfied its insurance brokerage performance obligation and recognizes
revenue.
8
Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining
the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability.
The established fair value hierarchy requires an entity
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows:
Level 1:
Quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
Observable,
market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs to the
valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments include
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due from related parties, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease liabilities
and due to related party. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature
of these instruments.
The Company noted no transfers between levels during
any of the periods presented. The Company did not have any instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring nor non-recurring
basis as of December 31, 2022.
Property
and Equipment
Property and
equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on
a straight-line basis, after consideration of expected useful lives and estimated residual values. The estimated annual deprecation rate
of these assets are generally as follows:
Schedule of estimated annual deprecation rate
Category
Depreciation
rate
Estimated residual value
Office
equipment
3 years
Nil
Leasehold
improvements
Shorter of
lease term or 3 years
Nil
Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals are the differences between net sales proceeds and
carrying amount of the relevant assets and are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company
evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts to the expected future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to these assets. If it is determined that an asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the expected discounted cash flows arising from those assets.
There were  no  impairment
losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
9
Leases
Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are
classified as operating or finance leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability,
calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized
over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line
rent expense over the lease term.
In calculating the right of use asset and lease liability,
the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having
initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
Taxation
Current income taxes are provided on the basis of
net profit for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income tax
purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net operating loss
carryforwards and credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided in accordance with
the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to
taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive income in the period of the enactment of the change.
The Company considers positive and negative evidence
when determining whether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers,
among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration
of statutory carry-forward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its tax planning strategies. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward
periods provided for in the tax law and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, the Company has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii) future
taxable income arising from implementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be reflected
within the industry.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit associated with
an uncertain tax position when, in its judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a
taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company initially and subsequently
measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that the Company judges to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with a taxing authority. The Company’s liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due
to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments
are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Company’s effective tax rate includes the net impact of
changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. The Company
classifies interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
10
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in
accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded
in the financial statements. It establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements
and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. ASC
718 also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees
in share-based payment transactions.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income attributable to holders of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between shares of common stock and other participating
securities based on their participating rights. Net loss is not allocated to other participating securities if based on their contractual
terms they are not obligated to share in the losses. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to holders
of common stock by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent
shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted loss per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting
pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have
a material impact on the Company.
3.
Deferred Asset
Deferred assets of $ 66,503
and $ 30,000
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, represented professional
service fees incurred for ongoing equity financing. The amounts will be charged against share capital when the respective equity financing
is completed.
4.
Equity
Reverse Stock Split
On August 10, 2021, the Company
effected a reverse stock split of its common stock, without changing the par value per share, whereby  each 30  issued and outstanding
shares of common stock were consolidated into one share of common stock (the “Reverse Split”). The Company has retrospectively
accounted for the change in the current and prior period financial statements that are presented in the condensed interim financial statements.
Common Stock
On April 29, 2021, the Company consummated a closing
of a “best efforts” self-underwritten public offering of its common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share (the “Offering”),
in which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 16,708 shares ( 501,250
shares before the Reverse Split) of its common stock at a
price of $12 per share ($ 0.40
before the Reverse Split) to certain investors, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 200,307 . Share
offering costs of $ 94,173
were offset against the share capital in relation to the Offering.
There were no treasury stock transactions during the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Income Taxes
Hong Kong
Under the current Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance,
the Company’s Hong Kong subsidiaries are subject to a
16.5 % income tax on their taxable income generated from operations in Hong
Kong. On December 29, 2017, Hong Kong government announced a two-tiered profit tax rate regime. Under the two-tiered tax rate regime,
the first HK$2.0 million assessable profits will be subject to a lower tax rate of 8.25% and the excessive taxable income will continue
to be taxed at the existing 16.5% tax rate. The two-tiered tax regime becomes effective from the assessment year of 2018/2019, which was
on or after April 1, 2018. The application of the two-tiered rates is restricted to only one nominated enterprise among connected entities.
The Company did not have current income tax expenses
for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 since it did not have taxable incomes in these two periods.
BVI
Under the current laws of the BVI, the Company is
not subject to tax on income or capital gain. Additionally, upon payments of dividends to the shareholders, no BVI withholding tax will
be imposed.
Cyprus

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.
The following discussion
and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere
in this Report. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are
forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors.
These statements are often identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions
or variations. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this
Report, and other factors that we may not know.
Overview
From 2016 to 2020, we were
a telemedicine company that provides Connect-a-Doc telemedicine kits to schools. Our services aimed to provide alternatives to schools
that desire to provide a higher level of healthcare to their students but are unable to keep a full-time school nurse available. In 2020
this business was discontinued and we became a non-operating “shell” company until our acquisition of YeeTah, as more fully
described below.
On October 21, 2020, we entered
into the Share Exchange Agreement with QDM BVI, and Huihe Zheng, the sole shareholder of QDM BVI, who is also our principal stockholder
and serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of QDM BVI in exchange
for the issuance to Mr. Zheng 30,000 shares (900,000 shares before the Reverse Split) of a newly designated Series C Preferred Stock,
with each share of Series C Preferred Stock initially being convertible into 11 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments
and limitations. The Share Exchange closed on October 21, 2020.
As a result of the consummation
of the Share Exchange, we acquired QDM BVI and its indirect subsidiary, YeeTah, an insurance brokerage company primarily engaged in the
sales and distribution of insurance products in Hong Kong. Following the closing of the transaction, we have assumed the business operations
of QDM BVI and its subsidiaries.
On November 3, 2021, the
Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of QDMS, a company incorporated on February 6, 2020 in Cyprus. The Company
acquired QDMS through an intermediary holding company, LGL, which was incorporated on July 29, 2021 in the BVI. Before the acquisition,
Huihe Zheng was the sole shareholder of QDMS. As part of the acquisition, Mr. Zheng sold all the shares of QDMS to LGL for a consideration
of EUR5,000 in November 2021 and at the same time the sole shareholder of LGL, Mengting Xu, transferred all her shares in LGL to the Company
for a consideration of USD$1.00. As a result, the Company acquired a 100% ownership of LGL, which, in turn, owns 100% of QDMS. QDMS plans
to engage in the research and development of customer relationship management (“CRM”) software as a service (“SaaS”),
with a business model derived from “customer-centered” CRM concept to improve enterprise-customers relationship. We plan to
market QDMS’ SaaS services to our network of banks, securities companies, insurance companies and other financial services providers
in Hong Kong and China.
Self-underwritten Offering
The Company filed a registration statement on Form
S-1 with the SEC, as amended (the “Registration Statement”), pursuant to which the Company is offering up to 30,000,000 shares
of its common stock on a best efforts/no minimum basis. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 27, 2023.
The offering will terminate three months after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
15
Impact of COVID-19
An outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus,
COVID-19, was identified in China and has subsequently been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic
has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this pandemic, the governments of many countries,
states, cities and other geographic regions, including Hong Kong, have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions
on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, insurance brokers in
Hong Kong have been greatly affected by the implementation of travel restrictions and social distancing measures. These restrictions and
measures have resulted in a significant decrease in new business for insurance brokers, such as YeeTah, that rely on in-person consultations
and storefronts for customer acquisition.
Customers from mainland China contributed to a large
part of YeeTah’s commissions. Regulations require their physical presence in Hong Kong to complete the policy contract. However,
due to the political turmoil and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 epidemic, mainland Chinese customers dropped sharply. As
a result, YeeTah’s revenue from commissions on new business decreased significantly during the pandemic. YeeTah’s commissions
from renewal premiums were materially affected since the mainland Chinese customers were late in making the renewal payments due to inability
to visit Hong Kong to make the payments. Most of YeeTah’s mainland customers do not have Hong Kong bank account and used to pay
their premiums through credit card or in cash in person.

Revenue
Revenue decreased by
approximately $7,800 or 14.2% and $544 or 2.2% respectively for the nine and three
months
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same periods of 2021. The decreases were mainly due to the decreases in the number of customers,
primarily PRC mainland customers, resulting from the prolonged COVID-19 travel restriction and quarantine measures imposed by PRC and
Hong Kong governments.
Cost of sales
The amounts decreased
by approximately $15,000 or 28% and $8,000 or 32.9% respectively for the nine and three
months
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same periods of 2021. The decreases were due to the decreases of revenue. The percentage of
decrease in costs of sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022 is significantly higher than the percentage of decrease of its
revenue in the period due to the lower commission paid out due to the dealing with the different insurance products and brokers.
16
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of employee salaries, office rents, insurance costs, general office operating expenses (e.g., utilities, repairs and maintenance) and
professional fees.
General and administrative
expenses decreased by approximately $25,000 or 9.2% for the nine  -  months
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021. The change is primarily due to the fact that there were more professional
expenses in relation to amendments to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K in 2021.
General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately
$13,000 or 14.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021. The change is primarily due to the
fact that there were more professional expenses in relation to amendments to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K in 2021.
Net loss
As a result of the factors described above, net loss
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $20,000 or 22.5% as compared to the same period of 2021.
As a result of the factors described above, net loss
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $35,000 or 12.9% as compared to the same period of 2021.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s reporting currency is the United
States dollar (“US$”). The Company’s operations are principally conducted in Hong Kong where the Hong Kong dollar is
the functional currency. The functional currency of the Company’s two subsidiaries, Lutter Global Limited and QDMI Software Group
Limited, is the Euro.
Transactions denominated in other than the functional currencies are re-measured into the functional currency of the entity at the exchange
rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional
currencies are translated into the functional currency at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange
differences are reported in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The exchanges rate used for
translation from Hong Kong dollar to US$ was 7.8000, a pegged rate determined by the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong. This pegged
rate was used to translate Company’s balance sheets, income statement items and cash flow items for both the three and nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The exchanges rates used for translation from
Euro to US$ are as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We
have financed
our operations primarily through cash generated by operating activities, equity financings and advances from our principal
stockholder. QDM is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through YeeTah, which is its only entity that
has operating cash inflows    . Our expenses are
paid directly either by YeeTah or our principal stockholder .
There have been no cash and any asset transactions
between us and our subsidiaries since the Share Exchange. As of December 31 and March 31, 2022, we had $121,140 and $69,658, respectively,
in cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consisted of cash deposited in banks.

Our working capital requirements mainly comprise of
commissions paid to technical representatives and referral fees, operating lease payments and employee salaries. Historically, our capital
requirements were generally met by cash generated from our operations, equity financings and funding from our principal stockholder. In
light of impact on our operations of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and Hong Kong, we undertook certain cost cutting measures, including
but not limited to, relocating to a new office with a much lower rent and reducing the number of employees. Discretionary expenditures
are also curtailed or reduced to save costs. In addition to adjusting our operating expenditures, we will continue to seek opportunities
of equity financings and financial supports from our principal stockholder. Although historically we were successful in obtaining equity
financings through the sales of our securities and obtaining loans from our principal stockholder, the availability of such financings
when required is dependent on many factors beyond our control, such as the unforeseeable impact from COVID-19 and the recovery of the
China and Hong Kong economy following the pandemic.
Operating Activities:
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately
$228,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $248,000 for 2021, representing
a decrease of approximately $20,000 in the net cash outflow in operating activities. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities
was primarily due to a decrease of net loss of $35,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021
and the following major working capital changes:
(1)
Change in prepaid
expenses resulted in an approximately $11,000 cash inflow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an approximately $8,000
cash inflow for the same period of 2021, which led to an approximately $3,000 increase in net cash inflow from operating activities.
(2)
Change in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities resulted in an approximately $1,000 cash inflow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an approximately
$4,000 cash inflow for the same period of 2021, which led to an approximately $3,000 decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities.
(3)
Change in due to a related
party resulted in an approximately $4,000 cash inflow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an approximately $20,000
cash inflow for the same period of 2021, which led to an approximately $16,000 decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities.
(4)
Change in accounts receivable
resulted in an approximately $11,000 cash outflow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an approximately $6,000 cash
outflow for the same period of 2021, which led to an approximately $5,000 increase in net cash outflow from operating activities.
(5)
Change
in non-cash item resulted in an approximately $6,000 cash inflow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to zero cash inflow
for the same period of 2021, which led to an approximately $6,000 increase in net cash inflow from operating activities.
Investing Activities:
Net cash used in investing
activities was approximately $15,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was solely attributable to acquisitions of fixed
assets. There were no investing cash activities for the same period of 2021.
18
Financing Activities:
Net cash generated from financing activities was approximately
$293,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was attributable to the net results of: (i) related-party advances of approximately
$180,000; (ii) stockholder contribution of $150,000; (iii) prepayment of $37,000 issuance costs for future equity financing.
Net cash generated from financing activities was approximately
$339,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, which was attributable to the net results of: (i) related-party advances of approximately
$363,000; (ii) share issuance proceeds of $200,500; (iii) repayment of related party of $200,500 and payment of $24,000 issuance costs
for share issued in the period.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.
19
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer (together, the “Certifying Officers”), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based
on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31,
2022 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with
small staff: (i) lack of proper segregation of duties and risk assessment process; (ii) lack of formal documentation in internal controls
over financial reporting; and (iii) lack of independent directors and an audit committee. We will devote resources to remediate these
material weaknesses as we grow and such resources required for implementing proper internal controls for financial reporting are available.
We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and
instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.
Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
