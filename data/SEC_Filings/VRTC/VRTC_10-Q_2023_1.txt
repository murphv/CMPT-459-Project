FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.
In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,”
“plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,”
“proposed,” “intended,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results
or our future financial condition or state other “forward-looking” information. There may be events in the future that we
are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of
the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and
that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of
your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, growth rates, and levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking
statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

NOTE
1 –
OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
Company
Veritec,
Inc. (Veritec) was formed in the State of Nevada on September 8, 1982. Veritec is primarily engaged in the development, sales, and licensing
of products and providing services related to its mobile banking solutions.
As
a Cardholder Independent Sales Organization, Veritec is able to promote and sell Visa-branded card programs. As a Third-Party Servicer,
Veritec provides back-end cardholder transaction processing services for Visa-branded card programs on behalf of its sponsoring bank.
Veritec has a portfolio of five United States and eight foreign patents. In addition, we have seven U.S. and twenty-eight foreign
pending patent applications. Veritec has had agreements with various banks in the past and is currently seeking a bank to sponsor its
Prepaid Card programs.
On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its barcode technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual property,
to The Matthews Group, a related party (see Note 6). The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews
Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2023. The Company earns a fee of 35% of all revenues
billed up to June 30, 2023, and recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed.
COVID-19
Considerations
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the responses that the Company, other businesses and
governments are taking continue to evolve. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a local, national and/or global economic recession. Policymakers
around the globe have responded with fiscal policy actions to support the economy as a whole, but it is presently unknown whether and
to what extent further fiscal actions will continue. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain.
The Company believes that its Mobile Banking revenues have been negatively affected due to the reduction in customer spending, which negatively
impacts the amount of fees earned by the Company from its customers. The Company previously experienced a decline in revenues earned under
the management services agreement with The Matthews Group, as The Matthews Group’s customer orders had been negatively impacted
by the effects of COVID-19. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue to depend
on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact
on the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As of the date
of issuance of the Company’s financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may in the future materially impact
the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States of America generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete financial statements.
F- 6
In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
been included. Operating results for the period ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending June 30, 2023. The Condensed Consolidated balance Sheet information as of June 30, 2022, was derived from the Company’s
audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 7, 2022. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with that report.
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Veritec and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Veritec Financial
Systems, Inc., Tangible Payment Systems, Inc., and Public Bell, Inc. Inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period
ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 583,000
and used cash in operating activities of $ 117,000 ,
and on December 31, 2022, the Company had a stockholders’ deficiency of $ 8,019,000 .
In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company is delinquent in payment of $ 753,000
of its convertible and notes payable. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2022 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The
Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal 2023 and to continue to develop its existing
projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company’s securities, generating sufficient
sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance that the Company can be successful
in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales, or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company is successful in raising such
funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing holders of common stock. The
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from this uncertainty.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, analysis of impairments
of long-lived assets, accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services, and valuation
of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenues
for the Company are classified into management fee revenue and mobile banking technology.
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). The underlying principle
of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC
606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1)
identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying the Company’s performance obligations in the contract or
agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5)
recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is
probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
F- 7
Mobile
Banking Technology Revenue
The
Company, as a merchant payment processor and a distributor, recognizes revenue from transaction fees charged to cardholders for the use
of its issued mobile debit cards. The fees are recognized on a monthly basis after all cardholder transactions have been summarized and
reconciled with third party processors.
Other
Revenue, Management Fee – Related Party
On
September 30, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual property,
to The Matthews Group (a related party, see Note 6). The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews
Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2023. The Company earned a fee of 35% of all revenues
billed up to December 31, 2022. The Company recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed.

customers are primarily manufacturing companies located in China.
F- 8
On
July 4, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement (“Nugen Agreement”) with Nugen Universe, LLC (“Nugen”), a
corporation located in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. Nugen seeks the Company to modify, create, or build a “private label”
system for Nugen, with an initial interest in the Company’s blinxPay technology and Bio-ID verification system. Nugen paid the Company
$ 50,000  at the Nugen Agreement signing date. During the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company delivered its obligations under
the Nugen Agreement, and the $ 50,000
payment was recorded as Mobile banking technology revenue during the period ended December 31, 2022.
The Nugen Agreement requires Nugen to pay the Company a 5% ongoing royalty for licensing the Company’s blinxPay technology and Bio-ID
verification system. As of December 31, 2022, no royalties have been realized under the Nugen Agreement.
On
October 10, 2022, the Company entered into a License and Distributor Agreement (“License Agreement”) with Nugen. The License
Agreement became effective on receipt of $ 200,000
in December 31, 2022 and extends through August 31, 2027. The License Agreement grants
Nugen a Worldwide license and distribution for the Company’s blinxPay Close-Loop Virtual Wallet and blinxPay Open-Loop Visa Debit
and all hardware products of the Company. Per the terms of the License Agreement, Nugen agrees to pay the Company a one-time license payment
of $ 1,000,000
for the right to market the Company’s products noted above, of which $ 200,000
was received by the Company in December
2022. The initial $ 200,000
has been recorded as deferred revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be amortized to
Mobile banking technology revenue over the remaining term of the License Agreement, which expires on August 31, 2027. The remaining balance
of $ 800,000
is scheduled to be paid as outlined in the License Agreement. In addition to the one-time license payment, Nugen agrees to
pay a minimum monthly support fee plus 5% royalty from all sales of products noted above. As of December 31, 2022, no royalty related
revenues have been realized under the License Agreement.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price in U.S. dollars that would be received for
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs,
of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:
•
Level
1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level
2 — Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level
3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.
The
carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate the
related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of convertible notes and notes payable
approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.
Net
Loss per Common Share
Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss)
applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury stock method. Potential common
shares are excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive.
For
the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive
securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.
F- 9
As
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire
shares of common stock, from our calculation of earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Segments
The
Company operates in one segment, the mobile financial banking industry. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of
the ASC, the Company’s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews
operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which
is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and
to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material
assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar
customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found
in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”).
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables.
The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model, under which companies
will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. As small business
filer, the standard will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”) “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).” ASU 2020-06 reduces the number
of accounting models for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the cash conversion and beneficial conversion models. The diluted
net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. For contracts in
an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by this update are freestanding and embedded features that are
accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement conditions of the derivative scope exception.
This update simplifies the related settlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled
in registered shares, (ii) consider whether collateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective
January 1, 2024, for the Company and the provisions of this update can be adopted using either the modified retrospective method or a
fully retrospective method. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
F- 10
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options .
ASU 2021-04 provides clarification and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding
equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An issuer measures
the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value
of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange. ASU 2021-04 introduces a recognition model that comprises four categories
of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and
modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided
in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all
entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-04 in an interim period, the guidance should
be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures.
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future financial statements.

CONTINGENT EARNOUT LIABILITY
On
September 30, 2014, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of the Tangible Payments LLC. A portion of the purchase price
for Tangible Payments LLC was an earnout payment of $ 155,000 . The earnout payment is payable on a monthly basis from the net profits derived
from the acquired assets commencing three months after the closing. The earnout payment is accelerated and the balance of the earnout
payment shall be due in full at such time as Veritec receives equity investments aggregating $ 1,300,000 . As of December 31, 2022, there
was no net profit derived from the acquired assets, and the Company had not yet received the required equity investments. Accordingly,
no payments were made on the earnout.

Technology comprised solely of its intellectual property to The Matthews Group. The Company then entered into a management services agreement
with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations, on behalf of The Matthews Group, through June 30, 2023.
The Matthews Group bears the risk of loss from the barcode operations and has the right to the residual benefits of the barcode operations.

ITEM
2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report.
The
following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the preparation of
our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis
together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
COVID-19
Considerations
The
Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the responses that the Company, other businesses and
governments are taking continue to evolve. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a local, national and/or global economic recession. Policymakers
around the globe have responded with fiscal policy actions to support the economy as a whole, but it is presently unknown whether and
to what extent further fiscal actions will continue. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain.
The
Company believes that its Mobile Banking revenues have been negatively affected due to the reduction in customer spending, which negatively
impacts the amount of fees earned by the Company from its customers. The Company is also currently experiencing a decline in revenues
earned under the management services agreement with The Matthews Group, as The Matthews Group’s customer orders have been negatively
impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue
to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity
of the impact on the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As
of the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may in the future materially
impact the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain.
Inflation
Global
inflation increased during 2021 and in 2022. The Russia Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as related international
response, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, including causing increases in the price for goods and services and global supply chain
disruptions, which have resulted and may continue to result in shortages in food products, materials and services. Such shortages have
resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, food products, materials and services, and could continue
to cause costs to increase as well as result in the scarcity of certain materials. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of
inflation or other negative economic factors or associated increases in our operating costs and how that may impact our business. To the
extent we are unable to recover higher operating costs resulting from inflation or otherwise mitigate the impact of such costs on our
and their business, our revenues and operating results could decrease, and our financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Recent
Events
On
July 4, 2022, we entered a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) for the purpose of forming a strategic partnership between
the Company and Nugen Universe, LLC (“Nugen”), a corporation located in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. Nugen seeks us
to modify, create, or build a “private label” system for Nugen, with an initial interest in our blinxPay technology and Bio-ID
verification system. Nugen paid us $50,000 at the date of the MOU signing and during the period ended December 31, 2022, we delivered
our obligations, and recorded the $50,000 payment as Mobile banking technology revenue during the period ended December 31, 2022. Nugen
further agreed to pay the us a 5% ongoing royalty for licensing the Company’s blinxPay technology and Bio-ID verification system.
As of December 31, 2022, no royalties have been realized under the MOU.
On
October 10, 2022, we entered into a License and Distributor Agreement (“License Agreement”) with Nugen. The License Agreement
became effective on receipt of $200,000 in December 31, 2022 and extends through August 31, 2027. The License Agreement grants Nugen a

Mobile
Banking Technology revenues include products such as the Company’s Blinx On-Off™ prepaid toggle Card and its Open Loop/Close
Loop System and Bio ID Card Platform. Mobile Banking Technology uses web-based mobile technology to offer financial cardholders the very
best technology in conducting secure financial transactions in real time, protecting personal identity, and financial account security.
Mobile Banking Technology revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were $70,000 and $23,000, respectively. The

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Our
cash balance on December 31, 2022 increased to $183,000 as compared to $66,000 on June 30, 2022. The increase was the result of the $234,000
cash provided by financing activities offset by $117,000 cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operations during the six
months ended December 31, 2022, was $117,000, compared with $319,000 of net cash used in operations during the same period of the prior
year. Cash used in operations during the six months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily from our net loss of $583,000, and general
net increases to our working capital accounts of $224,000, offset by interest accrued on notes payable of $242,000.
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss of $583,000 and used cash in operating activities of $117,000, and at December
31, 2022, the Company had a stockholders’ deficiency of $8,019,000. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company is in
default on $753,000 of its convertible and notes payable. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2022 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern.
The
Company believes its cash and forecasted cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to continue operations through fiscal 2023 without
continued external investment. The Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal 2023 and
to continue to develop its existing projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company’s
securities, generating sufficient sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance
that the Company can be successful in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company
is successful in raising such funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing
holders of common stock.

The
Company has traditionally been dependent on The Matthews Group, LLC, a related party, for its financial support. The Matthews Group is
owned 50% by Van Tran, the Company’s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50% by Lawrence J. Johanns, a significant Company stockholder.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment
of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities, fair value of warrant derivatives and certain expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
6
Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology comprised solely of its intellectual property to The Matthews

ITEM
4 -- CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”).  Based
upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting described in our Form 10-K on June 30, 2022.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
In
our Form 10-K on June 30, 2022, we identified certain matters that constitute material weaknesses (as defined under the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2) in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed on Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  We are undergoing ongoing evaluation and improvements in our internal
control over financial reporting.  Regarding our identified weaknesses, we have performed the following remediation efforts:
•
We
have assigned our audit committee with oversight responsibilities.
•
Our
financial statements, periodic reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, our monthly bank statements
and imaged checks are now continuously reviewed by our chief financial officer and chief executive officer.
•
All
significant contracts are now being reviewed and approved by our board of directors in conjunction with the chief executive officer.
There
was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART

ITEM
1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
September 21, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with an individual who was a former officer of the Company.
The individual in prior years was also issued 500,000 shares of common stock for services.  The Company alleged that the individual
used the Company’s intellectual property without approval.   Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the individual agreed
to relinquish a convertible note payable and unpaid interest aggregating $364,686 and return 500,000 shares of common stock previously
issued to him.  In turn, the Company agreed to release and discharge the individual against all claims arising on or prior to the
date of the settlement agreement.  As of December 31, 2022, the 500,000 shares have not been relinquished. When the Company receives
the shares, it will record a cancellation of shares.
