LONGDUODUO COMPANY LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Longduoduo Company Limited (“Longduoduo”,
together as a group with Longduoduo’s subsidiaries was referred to the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on October 25, 2021. The Company provides comprehensive and high-quality preventive healthcare solutions including
a wide range of preventive healthcare services, including disease screening healthcare treatment, healthcare products and other services
through a network of third-party healthcare service providers.
Longduoduo’s subsidiaries include:
● Longduoduo
Company Limited (Hong Kong)  (“Longduoduo HK”), which was established on July 26, 2021 under the laws of Hong Kong.
On October 26, 2021, Longduoduo issued  300,000,000  shares of its common stock to the original shareholders of Longduoduo HK,
in exchange for  100 % of the outstanding shares of Longduoduo HK (the “Share Exchange”).
● Longduoduo
Health Technology Company Limited  (“Longduoduo Health Technology”), a privately held Limited Company registered
in Inner Mongolia, China on August 20, 2020. On August 16, 2021, Longduoduo HK acquired  100 % of the ownership of Longduoduo Health
Technology from the original shareholders of Longduoduo Health Technology.
● Inner
Mongolia Qingguo Health Consulting Company Limited  (“Qingguo”), a privately held Limited Company registered in Inner
Mongolia, China on June 18, 2020. On September 8, 2020, Longduoduo Health Technology acquired  90 % of the ownership of Qingguo from
the original shareholders of Qingguo.

Mongolia Tianju Health Consulting Company Limited  (“Tianju”), a privately held Limited Company registered in Inner
Mongolia, China on July 5, 2021. Longduoduo Health Technology has controlled  51 % of Tianju since inception.
The transactions summarized above are treated
in the Company’s financial statements as a corporate restructuring (reorganization) of entities under common control, as each of
the seven entities have at all times been under the control of Mr. Zhang Liang. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5, the current
capital structure has been retroactively presented in prior periods as if such structure existed at that time, and the entities under
common control are presented on a combined basis for all periods. Since all of the subsidiaries were under common control for all periods
presented, the results of these subsidiaries are included in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented.

LONGDUODUO COMPANY LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. Going concern
Management has determined there is substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as a result of lack of significant revenues and recurring losses.
If the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure additional financing, it may be required to cease or curtail its operations.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Company’s operations have been financed
primarily by advances and loans from related parties. Zhang Liang, the president, chairman of the board, director and a shareholder of
Longduoduo, will provide support in the future if needed.
Management intends to expand product offerings
and increase the Company’s customers, so as to have a stable base for competition. In this manner, Management hopes to generate
sufficient operating cash inflow to support its future operations and development of the Company in addition to capital raised from shareholders’
support.
B. Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are expressed in U.S. Dollars and have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
C. Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Longduoduo and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated
financial statements include  100 % of assets, liabilities, and net income or loss of these subsidiaries.
Longduoduo’s subsidiaries as of December
31, 2022 are listed as follows:

D. Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made;
however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the inventory
valuation allowance and the treatment of the shares issued. These estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that
management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
E. Functional currency and foreign currency
translation
An entity’s functional currency is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily
generates and expends cash. Management’s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators,
such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency
of the Company is the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB’), except the functional currency of Longduoduo HK is the Hong Kong Dollar and
the functional currency of Longduoduo is the United States dollar (“US Dollars” or “$”). The reporting currency
of these consolidated financial statements is in US Dollars.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
The financial statements of Longduoduo’s
subsidiaries, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, the US Dollar. Assets and
liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each reporting period end date. Revenue and expenses are translated using weighted
average rates prevailing during each reporting period, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) is translated at historical exchange rates.
Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or expense.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from these transactions are included in operations.
The exchange rates used for foreign currency translation

H. Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred, while additions and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation is
recorded on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. When assets are retired or disposed, the asset’s original
cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from those accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income.
The Company capitalizes certain costs associated
with the acquisition of software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the software’s expected useful life.
The estimated useful lives for property and equipment
categories are as follows:
Office equipment and furniture
3  years
Leasehold Improvements
1 - 5  years
I. Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of software. Intangible
assets are initially recognized at their respective acquisition costs. All of the Company’s intangible assets have been determined
to have finite useful lives and are, therefore, amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives:
Software
3  years
J. Fair value measurements
The Company applies the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 820,  Fair Value
Measurements  (“ASC 820”), for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. In determining the fair value for the assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC
820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Quoted prices, other than
those in Level 1, in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability,
Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques
that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
There were no transfers between level 1, level
2 or level 3 measurements for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Financial assets and liabilities of the Company
are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, other receivables, inventories, due from related parties, accounts
payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, due to related parties, loan from third party, security deposits, other current liabilities,
operating lease liabilities and other payables. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the carrying values of these financial instruments
approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.

K. Segment information and geographic data
The Company is operating in one segment in accordance
with the accounting guidance in FASB ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting . The company’s revenues are from customers in
People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). All assets of the Company are located in the PRC.
L. Revenue recognition
The Company adopted FASB ASC Section 606 —
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the sales of products and services by applying
the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine
the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when
each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue when the amount
of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity, and specific criteria have been met
for each of the Company’s activities as described below.
Service and Product Revenue
The Company sells healthcare package, including
healthcare consulting services and healthcare products. Customers may purchase healthcare services package, or healthcare services combined
with nutritional products. Currently all sales of products are bundled with healthcare services. The combination of services and products
are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For the sale of healthcare package that
includes services and products, the Company allocates revenues based on their relative selling prices.
The Company sells healthcare service package to
a customer which represents the rights to services purchased by the Company. The delivery of healthcare service package to a customer
represents a separate performance obligation. The Company’s policy is to recognize the service revenue when service is provided,
at that time the sold healthcare service package, ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. Accordingly, revenue
is recognized at the point in time when the service is provided. Service revenue is recognized when the healthcare service package has
been delivered to the customer as no remaining performance obligation after the delivery of healthcare service package.
Management regularly reviews the sales return
and allowance based on historical experience. Any subsequent sales return and cancellations are recognized upon notification from the
customers. The amount of sales return allowance for the sale of healthcare service package amounted to $ 4,456  and $ 4,817  as
of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Management’s estimated sales return were  1.27 % and  0 %, respectively,
of the total service revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Product revenue mainly resulted from the sale
of healthcare and nutritional products, including Collagen peptide, Calcium tablet and other products. The Company recognized revenue
when the product has been delivered, ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. The Company accepts returns in
case of the products are well packaged and can be resold. Management regularly reviews the sales return and allowance based on historical
experience. The amount of sales return allowance for the sale of healthcare products amounted to $ 860  and $ 997  as of December
31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Management’s estimated sales return were  1.75 % and  0 %, respectively, of the
total product revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The Company typically collects fees before delivery
of healthcare package. Amounts received from a customer before the delivery of healthcare package are recorded as deferred revenue on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of service consists primarily of the cost
of healthcare service package purchased from third party healthcare service providers to fulfil a contract with a customer, and no asset
was recognized from the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer.
Cost of products consists primarily of the cost
of healthcare products purchased from suppliers. Cost of products is recognized when the product has been delivered to the customer.
M. Income taxes
The Company follows FASB ASC Section 740,  Income
Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
F- 9
LONGDUODUO COMPANY LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
ASC 740-10-30 requires income tax positions to
meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-30, tax positions that
previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in
which that threshold is met.
The application of tax laws and regulations is
subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a
result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability
may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse
previously recorded tax liabilities or the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10,
the Company made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by ASC
740-10. The Company recognized no material adjustments to liabilities or shareholder’s equity as a result of the implementation.
N. Earnings (loss) per share
The Company computes earnings (loss) per share
(“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share . ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures
to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income (loss) divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding
during the period.
Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents
the dilutive effect on a per share basis of contracts to issue common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if
they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. The computation of diluted EPS includes
the estimated impact of the exercise of contracts to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method and the potential shares of
converted common stock associated with the convertible debt using the if-converted method. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive
effect (i.e., those that increase earnings per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was not party to any contract to issue shares.
O. Risks and uncertainties
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”)
declared the coronavirus (COVID 19), a global pandemic and public health emergency. The WHO has recommended containment and mitigation
measures worldwide and domestically, self-isolation and shelter-in-place requirements have been or are being put in place. At this point,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic, or the extent to which this disruption may impact its
financial statements and future results of operations. Our future business outlook and expectations are very uncertain due to the impact
of the COVID-19 outbreak and are very difficult to quantify. It is difficult to assess or predict the impact of this unprecedented event
on our business, financial results or financial condition.
P. Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
We do not believe that any recently issued but
not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, statements of operations and cash flows.

The Company did not recognize deferred tax assets
since it is not likely to realize such deferred taxes. The deferred tax would apply to Longduoduo in the U.S. and Longduoduo Health Technology
and subsidiaries in China.
As of December 31, 2022, Longduoduo Health Technology
and its subsidiaries has total net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $ 1,355,904  in the PRC that expire through 2027.
Due to the uncertainty of utilizing these carry forwards, the Company provided a  100 % allowance on all deferred tax assets of approximately
$ 338,976  and $ 238,921  related to its operations in the PRC as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The PRC
valuation allowance has increased by approximately $ 100,055  and $ 112,668  for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
respectively.
The Company has incurred losses from its United
States operations during the six months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $ 92,389 . The Company’s United States operations
consist solely of ownership of its foreign subsidiaries, and the losses arise from administration expenses. Accordingly, management provided
a  100 % valuation allowance of approximately $ 67,525  and $ 48,123  against the deferred tax assets related to the Company’s
United States operations as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, because the deferred tax benefits of the net operating
loss carry forwards in the United States are not likely to be utilized. The US valuation allowance has increased by approximately $ 19,402  and
$ 13,169  for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
The Company is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States as well as by the taxing authorities in China, where the Company has significant

term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption
of Topic 842, the Company did not combine lease and non-lease components.
Most leases do not include options to renew. The
exercise of lease renewal options has to be agreed by the lessors. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited
by the term of leases, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Lease expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease expense related to these noncancelable operating leases was $ 42,989  and

NOTE 9. CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the
consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more
future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment
inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the
Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of
any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that
it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not
probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with
an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered to be remote by
management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
The Company was not subject to any material loss
contingency as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

NOTE 11. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common
shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise of share-based awards, using the treasury stock method. The reconciliation of the numerators

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of such financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real
estate assets, bad debts, impairment, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual
results will not differ from those estimates.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations is based upon its condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and
material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
In connection with the preparation of our financial
statements for the three months ended December 31, 2022, there was no accounting estimate made which was (a) subject to a high degree
of uncertainty and (b) material to our results.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
our revenue was $64,194, and was attributable to the sale of healthcare services and healthcare products, primarily derived from sales
of “Immunological Ozonated Autohemotherapy”, “Meridian-regulating and Consciousness-restoring Iatrotechnics”,
“Assay”, “PRP” and other healthcare services. As of December 31, 2022, we operate through five entities: Longduoduo
Health Technology, Tianju, Qingguo, Rongbin and Chengheng, which are established in Ordos, Ulanqab, Huhhot, Baotou and Ordos, respectively,
the four of largest cities in Inner Mongolia of China. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, our revenue decreased $861,318
(or 93%) compare to same period of last year, mainly the operations of five operating entities were almost completely stagnation, due
to COVID-19 in October and November of 2022.
Cost of revenue mainly consists of our cost for
third-party healthcare service providers who perform healthcare services for our customers and the cost of purchasing products. During
the three ended December 31, 2022, our cost of revenue was $25,801, with the result that our gross profit was $38,393, a gross margin
of 59%. Gross margin at that level was sufficient to operate profitably. However, we incurred a substantial net loss because the Company
incurred significant marketing expense to in connection with establishing its brand as a new company. The Company will continue to invest
heavily in advertising and promotion expenses in the near future as it continues to establish and expand its brand and products and services.
Operating expenses consist primarily of advertising
and promotion expenses, salaries and benefits, office expenses, professional fees and depreciation and amortization. Our operating expenses
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $704,456, primarily attributable to:
● $7,627
in advertising and promotion expenses incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $486,615 recorded during
the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease of marketing service fee, which is
calculated by revenue paid from the company.
● $95,494
in salaries and benefits expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $180,963 during the three months ended December
31, 2021. The decrease in our labor costs was primarily caused by the COVID-19 described above.
● $50,674
in office expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $193,427 during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in office expenses was also primarily caused by the COVID-19 described above.
As described above, our net loss for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 were $176,160, compared to a net loss of $303,513 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our
local currency, the Renminbi (RMB), is our functional currency. Results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange
rates during the period being reported upon, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by OANDA
on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in other comprehensive income (loss). For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(41,600) and $(9,240), respectively,

in advertising and promotion expenses incurred during the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $6,642,517 recorded during

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $118,274
in cash and cash equivalents. On the same date, we had a working capital deficit of $1,640,032, primarily because we had received $805,748
from customers as prepayment for future services and products but used the majority of the deposited sums to pay ongoing expenses and
had only $9,160 in prepayments on our December 31, 2022 balance sheet. Going forward, we will strive to achieve a better balance of customer
deposits and prepayments; but we will achieve that better balance only when profits from operations and funds from financing are adequate
to support the expansion effort that will be necessary for successful operations.
We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements
will arise from the need to fund our growth, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for
such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from a public offering and/or debt financing.
We expect Zhang Liang, our President, to continue to provide support in the future, if needed. However, we can provide no assurances that
we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at
all, to remain a going concern.

Trends, Events and Uncertainties
There is substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of significant revenues and recurring losses. If we are unable to generate significant
revenue or secure additional financing, we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse
impact and created many uncertainties related to our business, and we expect that it will continue to do so. The Company is experiencing
challenges in sales, which have increased the Company’s financial uncertainty. Our future business outlook and expectations are
very uncertain due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and are very difficult to quantify. It is difficult to assess or predict the
impact of this unprecedented event on our business, financial results or financial condition. Factors that will impact the extent to which
the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, financial results and financial condition include: the duration, spread and severity of the
pandemic; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including government actions to mitigate the economic impact of
the pandemic; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, including whether any future outbreaks
interrupt the economic recovery.
The U.S. government, including the SEC, has made
statements and taken actions that have led to changes in relations between the U.S. and China, and will impact companies with connections
to the United States or China. Those actions by the U.S. government included imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products
manufactured in China and imposing sanctions and restrictions in relation to China. Actions by the SEC included issuing statements indicating
that it would make enhanced review of companies with significant China-based operations. It is unknown whether and to what extent new
legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws or regulations will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on U.S.-domiciled
companies with significant connections to China, our industry or on us. Any unfavorable government policies on cross-border relations,
including increased scrutiny on companies with significant China-based operations, capital controls or tariffs, may affect our ability
to raise capital and the market price of our shares. If any new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws and/or regulations are implemented,
if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China
tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise
capital and the market price of our shares. Changes in United States and China relations and/or regulations may adversely impact our business,
our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our shares.
Other than the factors listed above we do not
know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our net sales or revenues
or income from continuing operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
There were no recent accounting pronouncements
that we expect to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Please refer to Note 2 of
our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.
Not applicable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management maintains disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have
the following material weaknesses:
● The
relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal
control system.
● Our
internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying and addressing complex accounting issues under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles.
● Our
Chief Financial Officer is not familiar with the accounting and reporting requirements of a U.S. public company.
● We
have not developed sufficient documentation concerning our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls.
Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective
as of December 31, 2022 for the purposes described in this paragraph.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
During the period covered by this report, there
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.

on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There have been no material changes from the risk
factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on October
