1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business Korn Ferry, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global organizational consulting firm. The Company helps clients synchronize strategy and talent to drive superior performance. The Company works with organizations to design their structures, roles and responsibilities. The Company helps organizations hire the right people to bring their strategy to life and advise them on how to reward, develop and motivate their people.
The Company is pursuing a strategy designed to help Korn Ferry focus on clients and collaborate intensively across the organization. This approach is intended to build on the best of the Company’s past and give the Company a clear path to the future with focused initiatives to increase its client and commercial impact. Korn Ferry is transforming how clients address their talent management needs. The Company has evolved from a mono-line to a diversified business, giving its consultants more frequent and expanded opportunities to engage with clients. In the past year, the Company has acquired companies that have added critical mass to its existing professional search and interim operations, as described in Note 10. This provided the Company with the opportunity to reassess how it manages the Recruitment Process Outsourcing (“RPO”) & Professional Search segment. Therefore, beginning in fiscal 2023, the Company separated RPO & Professional Search into two segments to align with the Company’s strategy and the decisions of the Company’s chief operating decision maker, who began to regularly make separate resource allocation decisions and assess performance separately between Professional Search & Interim and RPO. The Company now has
eight
reportable segments that operate through the following
five
lines of business: 1. Consulting
aligns organization structure, culture, performance and people to drive sustainable growth by addressing four fundamental needs: Organizational Strategy, Assessment and Succession, Leadership and Professional Development, and Total Rewards. This work is supported by a comprehensive range of some of the world’s leading intellectual property (“lP”) and data. The Consulting teams employ an integrated approach across core capabilities and integrated solutions, each one intended to strengthen the work and thinking in the next, to help clients execute their strategy in a digitally enabled world. 2. Digital
delivers scalable tech-enabled solutions designed to identify the best structures, roles, capabilities and behaviors to drive businesses forward. The digital products give clients direct access to Korn Ferry proprietary data, client data and analytics to deliver clear insights with the training and tools needed to align organizational structure with business strategy. 3. Executive Search
helps organizations recruit board level, chief executive and other senior executive and general management talent to deliver lasting impact. The Company’s approach to placing talent is bringing together research-based IP, proprietary assessments and behavioral interviewing with practical experience to determine ideal organizational fit. Salary benchmarking then builds appropriate frameworks for compensation and retention. This business is managed and reported on a geographic basis and represents four of the Company’s reportable segments (Executive Search North America, Executive Search Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Executive Search Asia Pacific and Executive Search Latin America). 4. Professional Search & Interim
delivers enterprise talent acquisition solutions for professional level middle and upper management. The Company helps clients source high-quality candidates at speed and scale globally, covering single-hire to multi-hire permanent placements and interim contractors. 5. RPO
offers scalable recruitment outsourcing solutions leveraging customized technology and talent insights. The Company's scalable solutions, built on science and powered by best-in-class technology and consulting expertise, enable the Company to act as a strategic partner in clients’ quest for superior recruitment outcomes and better candidate fit. Basis of Consolidation and Presentation The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 for the Company and its wholly and majority owned/controlled domestic and international subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements conform with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing practice within the Company's different industries. The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals and any other adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for these periods. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year. 7 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) The Company has control of a Mexican subsidiary and consolidates the operations of this subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest, which represents the Mexican partners’
51 % interest in the Mexican subsidiary, is reflected on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures. Use of Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in estimates are reported in current operations as new information is learned or upon the amounts becoming fixed or determinable. The most significant areas that require management’s judgment are revenue recognition, deferred compensation, annual performance-related bonuses, evaluation of the carrying value of receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, share-based payments, leases and the recoverability of deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition Substantially all fee revenue is derived from talent and organizational consulting services and digital sales, stand-alone or as part of a solution, fees for professional services related to executive and professional recruitment performed on a retained basis and RPO, either
stand-alone or as part of a solution.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Revenue contracts with customers are evaluated based on the five-step model outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers: 1) identify the contract with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligation(s); and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
Consulting fee revenue is primarily recognized as services are rendered, measured by total hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours at completion. It is possible that updated estimates for consulting engagements may vary from initial estimates with such updates being recognized in the period of determination. Depending on the timing of billings and services rendered, the Company accrues or defers revenue as appropriate.
Digital fee revenue is generated from IP platforms enabling large-scale, technology-based talent programs for pay, talent development, engagement, and assessment and is consumed directly by an end user or indirectly through a consulting engagement. Revenue is recognized as services are delivered and the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment. Revenue also comes from the sale of the Company’s proprietary IP subscriptions, which are considered symbolic IP due to the dynamic nature of the content. As a result, revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. Functional IP licenses grant customers the right to use IP content via the delivery of a flat file. Because the IP content license has significant stand-alone functionality, revenue is recognized upon delivery and when an enforceable right to payment exists. Revenue for tangible and digital products sold by the Company, such as books and digital files, is recognized when these products are shipped. Fee revenue from executive and professional search activities is generally one-third of the estimated first-year cash compensation of the placed candidate, plus a percentage of the fee to cover indirect engagement-related expenses. In addition to the search retainer, an uptick fee is billed when the actual compensation awarded by the client for a placement is higher than the estimated compensation. In the aggregate, upticks have been a relatively consistent percentage of the original estimated fee; therefore, the Company estimates upticks using the expected value method based on historical data on a portfolio basis. In a standard search engagement, there is one performance obligation, which is the promise to undertake a search. The Company generally recognizes such revenue over the course of a search and when it is legally entitled to payment as outlined in the billing terms of the contract. Any revenues associated with services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is resolved, as this is when control is transferred to the customer. These assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition for the reported period. In addition to talent acquisition for permanent placement roles, the Professional Search & Interim segment also offers recruitment services for interim roles. Interim roles are short term in duration, generally less than 12 months. Generally, each interim role is a separate performance obligation. The Company recognizes fee revenue over the duration that the interim resources’ services are provided which also aligns to the contracted invoicing plan and enforceable right to payment. 8 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) RPO fee
revenue is generated through two distinct phases: 1) the implementation phase and 2) the post-implementation recruitment phase. The fees associated with the implementation phase are recognized over the period that the related implementation services are provided. The post-implementation recruitment phase represents end-to-end recruiting services to clients for which there are both fixed and variable fees, which are recognized over the period that the related recruiting services are performed. Reimbursements The Company incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed by its clients, which are accounted for as revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts An allowance is established for doubtful accounts by taking a charge to general and administrative expenses. The Company’s expected credit loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers’ trade accounts receivable. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimate of amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is primarily based on historical loss-rate experience. When required, the Company adjusts the loss-rate methodology to account for current conditions and reasonable and supportable expectations of future economic and market conditions. The Company generally assesses future economic condition for a period of sixty to ninety days, which corresponds with the contractual life of its accounts receivables. After the Company exhausts all collection efforts, the amount of the allowance is reduced for balances written off as uncollectible.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company’s investments in cash equivalents consisted of money market funds, and as of April 30, 2022 also consisted of commercial paper with initial maturity of less than 90 days for which market prices are readily available.
Marketable Securities The Company currently has investments in marketable securities and mutual funds that are classified as either equity securities or available-for-sale debt securities. The classification of the investments in these marketable securities and mutual funds is assessed upon purchase and reassessed at each reporting period. These investments are recorded at fair value and are classified as marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The investments that the Company may sell within the next 12 months are carried as current assets. The Company invests in mutual funds (for which market prices are readily available) that are held in trust to satisfy obligations under the Company’s deferred compensation plans. Such investments are classified as equity securities and mirror the employees’ investment elections in their deemed accounts in the Executive Capital Accumulation Plan and similar plans in Asia Pacific and Canada (“ECAP”) from a pre-determined set of securities. Realized gains (losses) on marketable securities are determined by specific identification. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis; dividends are recorded as earned on the ex-dividend date. Interest, dividend income and the changes in fair value in marketable securities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in other income (loss), net. The Company also invests cash in excess of its daily operating requirements and capital needs primarily in marketable fixed income (debt) securities in accordance with the Company’s investment policy, which restricts the type of investments that can be made. The Company’s investment portfolio includes commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities. These marketable fixed income (debt)
securities are classified as available-for-sale securities based on management’s decision, at the date such securities are acquired, not to hold these securities to maturity or actively trade them. The Company carries these marketable debt securities at fair value based on the market prices for these marketable debt securities or similar debt securities whose prices are readily available. The changes in fair values, net of applicable taxes, are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of comprehensive income unless the change is due to credit loss. A credit loss is recorded in the statements of income in other income (loss), net; any amount in excess of the credit loss is recorded as unrealized losses as a component of comprehensive income. Generally, the amount of the loss is the difference between the cost or amortized cost and its then current fair value; a credit loss is the difference between the discounted expected future cash flows to be collected from the debt security and the cost or amortized cost of the debt security. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,
no
amount was recognized as a credit loss for the Company’s available for sales debt securities. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For those assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value, the Company determines
9 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) the fair value based upon the quoted market price, if available. If a quoted market price is not available for identical assets, the fair value is based upon the quoted market price of similar assets. The fair values are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy as defined below: • Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. • Level 2:
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. • Level 3:
Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These included cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair values of marketable securities classified as equity securities are obtained from quoted market prices, and the fair values of marketable securities classified as available-for-sale and foreign currency forward contracts are obtained from a third party, which are based on quoted prices or market prices for similar assets and financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures primarily originating from intercompany balances due to cross border work performed in the ordinary course of business. These foreign currency forward contracts are neither used for trading purposes nor are they designated as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging . Accordingly, the fair value of these contracts is recorded as of the end of the reporting period in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, while the change in fair value is recorded to the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Business Acquisitions Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquisition method requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill, or if the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase price consideration, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. Adjustments to fair value assessments are generally recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than 12 months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense as committed and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and non-current operating lease liability, in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and the lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term on the commencement date. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease payments recognized in the periods in which they are incurred. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For all leases with non-lease components the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 10 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include property, equipment, ROU assets and software developed or obtained for internal use. In accordance with ASC 360,
Property, Plant and Equipment , management reviews the Company’s recorded long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company determines the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon its expectation of the asset’s future usability, as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reduced its real estate footprint and as a result, the Company took an impairment charge of ROU assets of $ 5.5
million and an impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of $ 4.4
million, both recorded in the consolidated statements of income in general and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company reduced its real estate footprint and as a result, the Company took an impairment charge of ROU assets of $ 7.4
million and an impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of $ 1.9
million, both recorded in the consolidated statements of income in general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Results of the annual qualitative impairment test performed as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount and no reporting units were at risk of failing the impairment test. As a result,
no
impairment charge was recognized. As of April 30, 2022, there were
no
indicators of impairment with respect to the Company’s goodwill. Intangible assets primarily consist of customer lists, non-compete agreements, proprietary databases and IP. Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized in a pattern in which the asset is consumed, if that pattern can be reliably determined, or using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
one
to
24
years. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible assets is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible assets is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset. The Company reviewed its intangible assets and noted
no
impairment as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. Compensation and Benefits Expense Compensation and benefits expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income consist of compensation and benefits paid to consultants (employees who originate business), executive officers and administrative and support personnel. The most significant portions of this expense are salaries and the amounts paid under the annual performance-related bonus plan to employees. The portion of the expense applicable to salaries is comprised of amounts earned by employees during a reporting period. The portion of the expenses applicable to annual performance-related bonuses refers to the Company’s annual employee performance-related bonus with respect to a fiscal year, the amount of which is communicated and paid to each eligible employee following the completion of the fiscal year.
Each quarter, management makes its best estimate of its annual performance-related bonuses, which requires management to, among other things, project annual consultant productivity (as measured by engagement fees billed and collected by Executive Search and Professional Search consultants and revenue and other performance/profitability metrics for Consulting, Digital, Interim and RPO consultants), the level of engagements referred by a consultant in one line of business to a different line of business, and Company performance, including profitability, competitive forces and future economic conditions and their impact on the Company’s results. At the end of each fiscal year, annual performance-related bonuses take into account final individual consultant productivity (including referred work), Company/line of business results, including profitability, the achievement of strategic objectives, the results of individual performance appraisals and the current economic landscape. Accordingly, each quarter the Company reevaluates the assumptions used to estimate annual performance-related bonus liability and adjusts the carrying amount of the liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and reports any changes in the estimate in current operations.
Because annual performance-based bonuses are communicated and paid only after the Company reports its full fiscal year results, actual performance-based bonus payments may differ from the prior year’s estimate. Such changes in the bonus estimate historically have been immaterial and are recorded in current operations in the period in which they are determined. The performance-related bonus expense was $ 94.1
million and $ 295.8
million during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income.
11 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) The performance-related bonus expense was $ 117.7
million and $ 332.9
million during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively, included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Other expenses included in compensation and benefits expense are due to changes in deferred compensation and pension plan liabilities, changes in cash surrender value (“CSV”) of company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) contracts, amortization of stock-based compensation awards, commissions, payroll taxes and employee insurance benefits. Unearned compensation on the consolidated balance sheets includes long-term retention awards that are generally amortized over
four -to- five years .
Restructuring Charges, Net The Company accounts for its restructuring charges as a liability when the obligations are incurred and records such charges at fair value. Changes in the estimates of the restructuring charges are recorded in the period the change is determined. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has employee compensation plans under which various types of stock-based instruments are granted. These instruments principally include restricted stock units, restricted stock and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The Company recognizes compensation expense related to restricted stock units, restricted stock and the estimated fair value of stock purchases under the ESPP on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in the prior periods in order to conform to the current period’s presentation. Recently Proposed Accounting Standards - Not Yet Adopted In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment in accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendment of this standard becomes effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The amendment should be applied prospectively to business combinations that occur after the effective date. The Company will adopt this guidance in its fiscal year beginning May 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance but does not anticipate that it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share ASC 260,
Earnings Per Share , requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends prior to vesting as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. The Company has granted and expects to continue to grant to certain employees under its restricted stock agreements, grants that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Such grants are considered participating securities. Therefore, the Company is required to apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury method or the two-class method.
Basic earnings per common share was computed using the two-class method by dividing basic net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share was computed using the two-class method by dividing diluted net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive common equivalent shares. Dilutive common equivalent shares include all in-the-money outstanding options or other contracts to issue common stock as if they were exercised or converted. Financial instruments that are not in the form of common stock, but when converted into common stock increase earnings per share, are anti-dilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, restricted stock awards of
1.2  million shares and
1.2
million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, restricted stock awards of
1.2
million shares and
1.2
million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. 12 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) The following table summarizes basic and diluted earnings per common share attributable to common stockholders: Three Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands, except per share data) Net income attributable to Korn Ferry $ 11,247   $ 84,101   $ 162,035   $ 234,696   Less: distributed and undistributed earnings to nonvested restricted stockholders 249   1,798   3,545   5,363   Basic net earnings attributable to common stockholders 10,998   82,303   158,490   229,333   Add: undistributed earnings to nonvested restricted stockholders 72   1,658   3,017   4,908   Less: reallocation of undistributed earnings to nonvested restricted stockholders 72   1,643   2,997   4,856   Diluted net earnings attributable to common stockholders $ 10,998   $ 82,318   $ 158,510   $ 229,385   Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 51,278   52,999   51,639   52,958   Effect of dilutive securities:       Restricted stock 150   490   352   573   ESPP 3   6   8   7   Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 51,431   53,495   51,999   53,538   Net earnings per common share: Basic earnings per share $ 0.21   $ 1.55   $ 3.07   $ 4.33   Diluted earnings per share $ 0.21   $ 1.54   $ 3.05   $ 4.28   3.

1,700,000
shares, leaving
2,248,284
shares available for issuance, subject to certain changes in the Company’s capital structure and other extraordinary events. The 2022 Plan requires a minimum
one-year
vesting for all future awards, and provides for the grant of awards to eligible participants, designated as either nonqualified or incentive stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, any of which are market-based, and incentive bonuses, which may be paid in cash or stock or a combination thereof. 15 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) Restricted Stock The Company grants time-based restricted stock awards to executive officers and other senior employees that generally vest over a
four-year
period. In addition, certain key management members typically receive time-based restricted stock awards upon commencement of employment and may receive them annually in conjunction with the Company’s performance review. Time-based restricted stock awards are granted at a price equal to fair value, which is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense for time-based restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company also grants market-based restricted stock units to executive officers and other senior employees. The market-based units vest after
three years
depending upon the Company’s total stockholder return over the
three-year
performance period relative to other companies in its selected peer group. The fair value of these market-based restricted stock units are determined by using extensive market data that is based on historical Company and peer group information. The Company recognizes compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Restricted stock activity during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 is summarized below: Shares

million. As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 78.8
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all non-vested awards of restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.6
years. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023,
370,857
shares of restricted stock totaling, $ 22.1
million, were repurchased by the Company, at the option of employees, to pay for taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022,

shares of restricted stock totaling $ 0.2
million and $ 18.2
million, respectively, were repurchased by the Company, at the option of employees, to pay for taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company has an ESPP that, in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, allows eligible employees to authorize payroll deductions of up to
15 % of their salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. On June 3, 2020, the Company amended the plan so that the purchase price of the shares purchased could not be less than
85 % or more than
100 % of the fair market price of the common stock on the last day of the enrollment period. This amendment became effective July 1, 2020. At the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on September 22, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved the Korn Ferry Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which, among other things, increased the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be purchased thereunder by
1,500,000
shares. Employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000
in stock during any calendar year. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the ESPP is
4.5  million shares. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, employees purchased
71,016
shares at $ 45.56
per share and
48,801
shares at $ 68.16
per share, respectively, under the ESPP. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, employees purchased
154,720
shares at an average price of $ 49.16
per share and
103,826

million and $ 160.8
million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, under the ECAP (see Note 6 — Deferred Compensation and Retirement Plans). Unvested obligations under the deferred compensation plans totaled $ 22.3
million and $ 24.0
million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the fair value of the investments increased; therefore, the Company recognized a gain of $ 12.7
million and $ 3.0
million, respectively, which was recorded in other income (loss), net. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments decreased; therefore, the Company recognized a loss of $ 7.7
million, which was recorded in other income (loss), net. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments increased; therefore, the Company recognized a gain of $ 2.4
million, which was recorded in other income (loss), net. Investments in marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are made based on the Company’s investment policy, which restricts the types of investments that can be made. As of January 31, 2023, marketable securities classified as available-for-sale consisted of commercial paper and corporate notes/bonds, and as of April 30, 2022, marketable securities classified as available-for-sale consisted of commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, for which market prices for similar assets are readily available. Investments that have an original maturity of 90 days or less and are considered highly liquid investments are classified as cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2023, available-for-sale marketable securities had remaining maturities ranging from
one month
to
15
months. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, there were $ 14.3
million and $ 47.3
million in sales/maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities, respectively. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, there were $ 18.7
million and $ 54.7
million in sales/maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities, respectively. Investments in marketable securities that are held in trust for settlement of the Company’s vested obligations under the ECAP are equity securities and are based upon the investment selections the employee elects from a pre-determined set of securities in the ECAP and the Company invests in equity securities to mirror these elections. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company’s investments in equity securities consisted of mutual funds for which market prices are readily available. Unrealized losses recorded for the period that relate to equity securities still held as of January 31, 2023 were $ 2.8
million. Unrealized gains recorded for the period that relate to equity securities still held as of January 31, 2022 were $ 12.0
million. 18 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges The fair value of derivatives not designated as hedge instruments are as follows: January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 (in thousands) Derivative assets: Foreign currency forward contracts $ 1,987   $ 1,639   Derivative liabilities:     Foreign currency forward contracts $ 684   $ 1,843   As of January 31, 2023, the total notional amounts of the forward contracts purchased and sold were $ 109.0
million and $ 35.8
million, respectively. As of April 30, 2022, the total notional amounts of the forward contracts purchased and sold were $ 89.7
million and $ 35.8
million, respectively. The Company recognizes forward contracts as a net asset or net liability on the consolidated balance sheets as such contracts are covered by master netting agreements. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a gain of $ 3.3
million and $ 1.2
million, respectively, related to forward contracts which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss of $ 0.3
million and a gain of $ 0.2
million, respectively, related to forward contracts which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Foreign currency gains and losses related to forward contracts are offset by foreign currency losses and gains that result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company’s functional currency. The cash flows related to foreign currency forward contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities. 6.
Deferred Compensation and Retirement Plans The Company has several deferred compensation and retirement plans for eligible consultants and vice presidents that provide defined benefits to participants based on the deferral of current compensation or contributions made by the Company subject to vesting and retirement or termination provisions. Among these plans is a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees in the U.S. The assets of this plan are held separately from the assets of the sponsor in self-administered funds. All other defined benefit obligations from other plans are unfunded. The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows: Three Months Ended January 31,

5.50 % and
6.00 % for January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (2) The service cost, interest cost and the other components of net periodic benefit costs are included in compensation and benefits expense, interest expense, net and other income (loss), net, respectively, on the consolidated statements of income. The Company purchased COLI contracts insuring the lives of certain employees eligible to participate in the deferred compensation and pension plans as a means of setting aside funds to cover such plans. The gross CSV of these contracts of $ 276.2  million and $ 263.2
million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively,
was offset by outstanding policy loans of $ 77.6
million and $ 79.8
million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. The CSV value of the underlying COLI investments increased by $ 2.5
million and $ 7.4
million during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, and was recorded as a decrease in compensation
19 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) and benefits expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The CSV value of the underlying COLI investment increased by $ 1.7
million and $ 3.9
million during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively, and was recorded as a decrease in compensation and benefits expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company’s ECAP is intended to provide certain employees an opportunity to defer their salary and/or bonus on a pre-tax basis. In addition, the Company, as part of its compensation philosophy, makes discretionary contributions into the ECAP and such contributions may be granted to key employees annually based on the employee’s performance. Certain key management may also receive Company ECAP contributions upon commencement of employment. The Company amortizes these contributions on a straight-line basis over the service period, generally a
five year
period. Participants have the ability to allocate their deferrals among a number of investment options and may receive their benefits at termination, retirement or ‘in service’ either in a lump sum or in quarterly installments over
one -to- 15
years. The ECAP amounts that are expected to be paid to employees over the next 12 months are classified as a current liability included in compensation and benefits payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The ECAP is accounted for whereby the changes in the fair value of the vested amounts owed to the participants are adjusted with a corresponding charge (or credit) to compensation and benefits costs. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, deferred compensation liability increased; therefore, the Company recognized compensation expense of $ 12.1
million and $ 3.5
million, respectively. Offsetting the increases in compensation and benefits expense was an increase in the fair value of marketable securities (held in trust to satisfy obligations of the ECAP liabilities) of $ 12.7
million and $ 3.0  million during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, recorded in other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of income. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, deferred compensation liability decreased; therefore, the Company recognized a reduction in compensation expense of $ 7.0
million. Offsetting the decrease in compensation and benefits expense was a decrease in the fair value of marketable securities (held in trust to satisfy obligations of the ECAP liabilities) of $ 7.7
million during the three months ended January 31, 2022, recorded in other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of income. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, deferred compensation liability increased; therefore, the Company recognized compensation expense of $ 3.1
million. Offsetting the increase in compensation and benefits expense was an increase in the fair value of marketable securities (held in trust to satisfy obligations of the ECAP liabilities) of $ 2.4
million during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, recorded in other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of income. (see Note 5— Financial Instruments ). 7.
Fee Revenue Contract Balances A contract asset (unbilled receivables) is recorded when the Company transfers control of products or services before there is an unconditional right to payment. A contract liability (deferred revenue) is recorded when cash is received in advance of performance of the obligation. Deferred revenue represents the future performance obligations to transfer control of products or services for which we have already received consideration. Deferred revenue is presented in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table outlines the Company’s contract asset and liability balances as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022: January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 (in thousands) Contract assets-unbilled receivables $ 112,299   $ 100,652   Contract liabilities-deferred revenue $ 268,611   $ 244,149   During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $ 161.9
million that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period. Performance Obligations The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to exclude the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with a duration of one year or less, which applies to all executive search, professional search and to most of the fee revenue from the interim business. As of January 31, 2023, the aggregate transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied for contracts with an expected duration of greater than one year at inception was $ 1,166.9
million. Of the $ 1,166.9
million of remaining performance obligations, the Company expects to recognize approximately $ 202.8
million in the remainder of fiscal 2023, $ 538.2
million in fiscal 2024, $ 265.4
million in fiscal 2025 and the remaining $ 160.5
million in fiscal 2026 and thereafter. However, this amount should not be considered an indication of the Company’s future revenue as contracts with an initial term of one year or less are not included. Further, our contract terms and
20 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) conditions allow for clients to increase or decrease the scope of services and such changes do not increase or decrease a performance obligation until the Company has an enforceable right to payment. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company disaggregates its revenue by line of business and further by region for Executive Search. This information is presented in Note 10— Segments .

Credit Losses The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through the services it provides. The Company’s expected credit loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is primarily based on historical loss-rate experience. When required, the Company adjusts the loss-rate methodology to account for current conditions and reasonable and supportable expectations of future economic and market conditions. The Company generally assesses future economic conditions for a period of sixty to ninety days, which corresponds with the contractual life of its accounts receivables. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. The Company’s monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. 21 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) The activity in the allowance for credit losses on the Company's trade receivables is as follows: (in thousands)

investment in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities on January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, were caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. The Company only purchases high grade bonds that have a maturity from the date of purchase of no more than
two years . The Company monitors the credit worthiness of its investments on a quarterly basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and does not believe it will be required to sell the investments before the investments mature and therefore recover the amortized cost basis. 9.
Income Taxes The provision for income tax was an expense of $ 8.5
million and $ 63.6
million in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, with an effective tax rate of
41.8 % and
27.8 %, respectively, compared to an expense of $ 26.9
million and $ 77.0
million in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, with an effective tax rate of
24.0 % and
24.4 %, respectively. In addition to the impact of U.S. state income taxes and the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which generally create variability in our effective tax rate over time, the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 were affected by a tax expense recorded for withholding taxes that are not eligible for credit. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was also elevated due to common permanent tax adjustments being applied to lower earnings resulting from restructuring charges recorded in the quarter. 10.
Segments In the past year, the Company has allocated capital to build out its Professional Search and Interim operations through the acquisition of Lucas Group, Patina and Infinity Consulting Solutions ("ICS"). These acquisitions provided the Company with the opportunity to reassess how it manages its RPO & Professional Search segment. Given the Company’s strategy and development of separate financial and operational metrics for the Professional Search & Interim and RPO operations, the Company’s chief operating decision maker began to regularly make separate resource allocation decisions between Professional Search & Interim and RPO. Therefore, on May 1, 2022, the Company changed the composition of its global segments and under the new reporting format, the RPO & Professional Search segment has been separated into two segments; Professional Search & Interim and RPO.
Revenues are directly attributed to a segment and expenses not directly associated with a specific segment are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including revenues, headcount and other factors. Due to this change, the Company completed a quantitative assessment for potential goodwill
22 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) impairment both prior and subsequent to the aforementioned change and determined there was
no
goodwill impairment. The presentation of operating results prior to May 1, 2022 has been revised to conform to the new segment reporting. The Company now has
eight
reportable segments: Consulting, Digital, Executive Search North America, Executive Search EMEA, Executive Search Asia Pacific, Executive Search Latin America, Professional Search & Interim and RPO. The Company’s
eight
reportable segments operate through the following
five
lines of business: 1. Consulting
aligns organization structure, culture, performance and people to drive sustainable growth by addressing four fundamental needs: Organizational Strategy, Assessment and Succession, Leadership and Professional Development and Total Rewards. This work is supported by a comprehensive range of some of the world’s leading lP and data. The Consulting teams employ an integrated approach across our core capabilities and integrated solutions, each one intended to strengthen the work and thinking in the next, to help clients execute their strategy in a digitally enabled world. 2. Digital
delivers scalable tech-enabled solutions designed to identify the best structures, roles, capabilities and behaviors to drive businesses forward. The digital products give clients direct access to Korn Ferry proprietary data, client data, and analytics to deliver clear insights with the training and tools needed to align organizational structure with business strategy. 3. Executive Search
helps organizations recruit board level, chief executive and other senior executive and general management talent to deliver lasting impact. The Company’s approach to placing talent is bringing together research-based IP, proprietary assessments and behavioral interviewing with practical experience to determine the ideal organizational fit. Salary benchmarking then builds appropriate frameworks for compensation and retention. This business is managed and reported on a geographic basis and represents four of the Company’s reportable segments (Executive Search North America, Executive Search EMEA, Executive Search Asia Pacific and Executive Search Latin America). 4. Professional Search & Interim
delivers enterprise talent acquisition solutions for professional level middle and upper management. The Company helps clients source high-quality candidates at speed and scale globally, covering single-hire to multi-hire permanent placements and interim contractors. 5. RPO
offers scalable recruitment outsourcing solutions leveraging customized technology and talent insights. The Company's scalable solutions, built on science and powered by best-in-class technology and consulting expertise, enables the Company to act as a strategic partner in clients’ quest for superior recruitment outcomes and better candidate fit. Executive Search is managed by geographic regional leaders. Worldwide operations for Consulting, Digital, Professional Search & Interim and RPO are managed by their Chief Executive Officers. The Executive Search geographic regional leaders and the Chief Executive Officers of Consulting, Digital, Professional Search & Interim and RPO report directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company also operates Corporate to record global expenses. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) review of 1) fee revenue and 2) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). To the extent that such costs or charges occur, Adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring charges, integration/acquisition costs, certain separation costs and certain non-cash charges (goodwill, intangible asset and other impairment charges). The CODM is not provided asset information by reportable segment. 23 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) Financial highlights are as follows: Three Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Consolidated

Long-Term Debt 4.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 On December 16, 2019, the Company completed a private placement of
4.625 % Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”) with a $ 400
million principal amount pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued with a $ 4.5
million discount and will mature December 15, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2020. The Notes represent senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture governing the Notes. Prior to December 15, 2022, the Company was permitted to redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to
100 % of the principal plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes), and accrued and unpaid interest. Also, prior to December 15, 2022, the Company was permitted to use the proceeds of certain equity offerings to redeem up to
35 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including any permitted additional notes, at a redemption price equal to
104.625 % of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest.
Since December 15, 2022, the Company may redeem the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on December 15 of each of the years indicated: Year Percentage 2022 102.313 % 2023 101.156 % 2024 and thereafter 100.000 % The Notes allow the Company to pay $ 25
million of dividends per fiscal year with no restrictions, plus an unlimited amount of dividends so long as the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio is not greater than
3.50
to 1.00, and the Company is not in default under the indenture governing the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company's existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiaries guarantee the Company's credit facilities. The indenture governing the Notes requires that, upon the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Decline (each as defined in the indenture), the Company shall make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at
101 % of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company used the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay $ 276.9
million outstanding under the Company’s prior revolving credit facility and to pay expenses and fees in connection therewith. The remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate requirements. The effective interest rate on the Notes was
4.86 % as of January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the fair value of the Notes was $ 377.0
million and $ 379.5
million, respectively, based on borrowing rates then required of notes with similar terms, maturity and credit risk. The fair value of the Notes was classified as a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 25 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) Long-term debt, at amortized cost, consisted of the following: In thousands January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 Senior Unsecured Notes $ 400,000   $ 400,000   Less: Unamortized discount and issuance costs ( 3,989 ) ( 4,523 ) Long-term borrowings, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs $ 396,011   $ 395,477   Credit Facilities On June 24, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its December 16, 2019 Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”; as amended by the Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks and Bank of America, National Association as administrative agent, to, among other things, (i) extend the existing maturity date of the revolving facility to June 24, 2027, (ii) provide for a new delayed draw term loan facility as described below, (iii) replace the London interbank offered rate with forward-looking SOFR term rate (“Term SOFR”) as described below, and (iv) replace the existing financial covenants with the financial covenant described below. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for
five-year
senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $ 1,150.0
million comprised of a $ 650.0
million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $ 500.0
million delayed draw term loan facility (the “Delayed Draw Facility”, and together with the Revolver, the “Credit Facilities”). The Amended Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, the Company may incur term loans or increase the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments by an aggregate amount up to $ 250.0
million plus an unlimited amount subject to a consolidated secured net leverage ratio of
3.25
to 1.00. Extensions of credit under the Delayed Draw Facility are available to the Company in up to two advances through June 24, 2023. Any amounts undrawn under the Delayed Draw Facility as of June 24, 2023 will no longer be available to the Company. The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain acquisitions, investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio of
3.50
to 1.00 (which may be temporarily increased to
4.00
following certain material acquisitions under certain circumstances) (the “Financial Covenant”). The principal balance of the Delayed Draw Facility, if any, is subject to annual term loan amortization of
2.5 % for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2022 through June 30, 2024, and
5.0 % for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024 through June 30, 2027, with the remaining principal due at maturity. The principal balance of the Revolver, if any, is due at maturity. The Credit Facilities mature on June 24, 2027 and any unpaid principal balance is payable on this date. The Credit Facilities may also be prepaid and terminated early by the Company at any time without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage fees). Amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of
0.10 %, plus an interest rate margin between
1.125 % per annum and
2.00 % per annum, depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio, or base rate plus an interest rate margin between
0.125 % per annum and
1.00 % per annum depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio. In addition, the Company will be required to pay to the lenders a ticking fee of
0.20 % per annum on the actual daily unused portion of the Delayed Draw Facility, and a quarterly commitment fee ranging from
0.175 % to
0.300 % per annum on the actual daily unused amount of the Revolver, based upon the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio at such time, and fees relating to the issuance of letters of credit. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, there was
no
outstanding liability under the Credit Facilities and the credit facilities under the Credit Agreement prior to the Amendment (the “Prior Credit Facility”), respectively. The unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Amended Credit Agreement was $ 4.4
million as of January 31, 2023 and $ 2.4
million under the Credit Agreement as of April 30, 2022. The debt issuance costs were included in other current assets and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. The Company has a total of $ 1,145.3
million available under the Credit Facilities and had a total $ 645.3
million available under the Prior Credit Facility after $ 4.7
million of standby letters of credit were issued as of both January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. The Company had a total of $ 11.6
million and $ 10.0
million of standby letters with other financial institutions as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. The standby letters of credit were generally issued as a result of entering into office premise leases. 26 KORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 31, 2023 (continued) 12.
Leases The Company’s lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases for office space and equipment and finance leases for equipment. Equipment leases are comprised of vehicles and office equipment. The majority of the Company’s leases include both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include maintenance, insurance, taxes and other utilities. The Company combines fixed payments for non-lease components with its lease payments and accounts for them as a single lease component, which increases its ROU assets and lease liabilities. Some of the leases include one or more options to renew or terminate the lease at the Company’s discretion. Generally, the renewal and termination options are not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. The Company has elected not to recognize a ROU asset or lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the future minimum lease payments. The Company applies the portfolio approach when determining the incremental borrowing rate since it has a centrally managed treasury function. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments in a similar economic environment. Operating leases contain both office and equipment leases and have remaining terms that range from less than
one year
to
9
years, some of which also include options to extend or terminate the lease. Finance leases are comprised of equipment leases and have remaining terms that range from less than
one year
to
six years . Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net while finance lease liabilities are included in other accrued liabilities and other liabilities. During both the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reduced its real estate footprint and as a result recorded an impairment charge of the ROU assets of $ 5.5
million recorded in the consolidated statements of income. During nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company reduced its real estate footprint and as a result recorded an impairment charge of the ROU assets of $ 7.4

Restructuring Charges, Net In light of the Company’s evolution to an organization that is selling larger integrated solutions in a world where there are shifts in global trade lanes and persistent inflationary pressures, on January 11, 2023, the Company initiated a plan (the “Plan”) intended to realign its workforce with its business needs and objectives, namely, to invest in areas of potential growth and implement reductions where there is excess capacity. Due to the implementation of the Plan, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $ 41.2
million in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 across all lines of business related to severance for positions that were eliminated. There were

Executive Summary Korn Ferry (referred to herein as the “Company” or in the first-person notations “we,” “our” and “us”) is a global organizational consulting firm. We help clients synchronize strategy, operations and talent to drive superior business performance. We work with organizations to design their structures, roles and responsibilities. We help them hire the right people to bring their strategy to life. And we advise them on how to reward, develop and motivate their people.
We are pursuing a strategy designed to help Korn Ferry to focus on clients and collaborate intensively across the organization. This approach is intended to build on the best of our past and give us a clear path to the future with focused initiatives to increase our client and commercial impact. Korn Ferry is transforming how clients address their talent management needs. We have evolved from a mono-line business to a multi-faceted consultancy business, giving our consultants more frequent and expanded opportunities to engage with clients. 31 Our eight reportable segments operate through the following five lines of business:
1. Consulting
aligns organization structure, culture, performance and people to drive sustainable growth by addressing four fundamental needs: Organizational Strategy, Assessment and Succession, Leadership and Professional Development, and Total Rewards. We support this work with a comprehensive range of some of the world’s leading lP and data. The Consulting teams employ an integrated approach across core solutions, each one intended to strengthen our work and thinking in the next, to help clients execute their strategy in a digitally enabled world. 2.

Salary benchmarking then builds appropriate frameworks for compensation and retention. This business is managed and reported on a geographical basis and represents four of the Company’s reportable segments (Executive Search North America, Executive Search Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Executive Search Asia Pacific (“APAC”), and Executive Search Latin America). 4. Professional Search & Interim

Our scalable solutions, built on science and powered by best-in-class technology and consulting expertise, enable us to act as a strategic partner in clients’ quest for superior recruitment outcomes and better candidate fit. Professional Search & Interim and RPO were formerly referred to, and reported together, as Korn Ferry RPO & Professional Search (“RPO & Professional Search”). We have recently acquired companies that have added critical mass to our professional search and interim operations. These acquisitions provided us the opportunity to reassess how we manage our RPO & Professional Search segment. Therefore, beginning in fiscal 2023, we separated RPO & Professional Search into two segments to align with the Company’s strategy and the decisions of the Company’s chief operating decision maker, who began to regularly make separate resource allocation decisions and assess performance separately between our Professional Search & Interim business and RPO business. Highlights of our performance in fiscal 2022 include: • Approximately 76% of the executive searches we performed in fiscal 2022 were for board level, chief executive and other senior executive and general management positions. Our more than 4,300 search engagement clients in fiscal 2022 included many of the world’s largest and most prestigious public and private companies.
• We have built strong client loyalty, with nearly 90% of the assignments performed during fiscal 2022 having been on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted assignments in the previous three fiscal years.
• Approximately 70% of our revenues were generated from clients that have utilized multiple lines of our business.
• In fiscal 2022, we acquired the Lucas Group and Patina Solutions Group ("Patina"). The Lucas Group brings substantial professional search and interim placement expertise to Korn Ferry and has enhanced our industry-leading search portfolio. Patina Solutions Group, an interim executive search firm brings access to a vast network of C-suite, top-tier, and professional interim talent. Performance Highlights On August 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of ICS for $99.3 million, net of cash acquired. ICS contributes interim professional placement offerings and expertise that are highly relevant for the new world of work where more workplaces are hybrid or virtual. ICS is a highly regarded provider of senior-level IT interim professional solutions with additional expertise in the areas of compliance and legal, accounting and finance, and human resources. The acquisition of ICS echoes the commitment to scale the Company's solutions and further increases the Company's focus at the intersection of talent and
32 strategy - wherever and however the needs of organizations evolve. ICS is part of our rapidly growing interim practice, which is included in the Professional Search & Interim segment. In light of the Company’s evolution to an organization that is selling larger integrated solutions in a world where there are shifts in global trade lanes and persistent inflationary pressures, on January 11, 2023, the Company initiated a plan (the “Plan”) intended to realign its workforce with its business needs and objectives, namely, to invest in areas of potential growth and implement reductions where there is excess capacity. The Plan is expected to reduce the Company’s annualized cost base by approximately $45.0 million to $55.0 million (after taking into account new hires in connection with the rebalancing of the Company’s workforce). The Plan consists of severance and related employee benefits payments and lease termination costs. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 the Company recorded $41.2 million in restructuring charges, net, and $5.5 million and $4.4 million in impairment of right-of-use asset and fixed assets, respectively, as a result of implementing the Plan. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the chief operating decision maker’s review of (1) fee revenue and (2) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). To the extent that such charges occur, Adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring charges, integration/acquisition costs, certain separation costs and certain non-cash charges (goodwill, intangible asset and other impairments charges). For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluded $41.2 million of restructuring charges, net, $5.5 million impairment of right-of-use assets, and $4.4 million impairment of fixes assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA further excluded $2.5 million and $9.5 million of integration/acquisition costs during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, Adjusted EBITDA excluded $3.2 million and $4.3 million of integration/acquisition costs, respectively. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA further excluded $7.4 million impairment of right-of-use assets and $1.9 million impairment of fixed assets during the nine months ended January 31, 2022. Consolidated and the subtotals of Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, they may not necessarily be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry’s performance by excluding certain charges, items of income and other items that may not be indicative of Korn Ferry’s ongoing operating results. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry’s historical performance and the identification of operating trends that may otherwise be distorted by the factors discussed above. Korn Ferry includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes it is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry’s ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making. The accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except that the above noted items are excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. Management further believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of which can vary substantially from company to company.
Fee revenue was $680.8 million during the three months ended January 31, 2023, an increase of $0.1 million, compared to $680.7 million in the three months ended January 31, 2022. Fee revenue decreased in Executive Search and Digital primarily due to a decline in demand for our products and services driven by the global economic slowdown. This decline in fee revenue was fully offset by increases in RPO and Professional Search & Interim fee revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. The acquisitions of Patina and ICS (the "Acquired Companies") were a significant factor in the year-over-year increase in Professional Search & Interim fee revenue. Exchange rates unfavorably impacted fee revenue by $23.2 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. Net income attributable to Korn Ferry in the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $11.2 million, decreased by $72.9 million as compared to $84.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in net income attributable to Korn Ferry was primarily due to restructuring charges, net and impairment charges of the ROU assets and fixed assets incurred in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and increases in cost of service expense and compensation and benefits expense. These increases were partially offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA in the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $96.1 million, decreased by $42.2 million as compared to $138.3 million in the year-ago quarter. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Executive Search, Consulting, Digital, Professional Search & Interim, and RPO lines of business contributed $46.4 million, $23.3 million, $22.2 million, $22.0 million, and $9.8 million, respectively, to Adjusted EBITDA, which was partially offset by Corporate expenses net of other income of $27.6 million. 33 Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $203.3 million to $1,007.8 million at January 31, 2023, compared to $1,211.1 million at April 30, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to annual bonuses earned in fiscal 2023 and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, retention payments, the acquisition of ICS, the semi-annual interest payment on the 4.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders during the nine months ended January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, we held marketable securities to settle obligations under our Executive Capital Accumulation Plan (“ECAP”) with a cost value of $187.0 million and a fair value of $188.8 million. Our vested obligations for which these assets were held in trust totaled $173.7 million as of January 31, 2023 and our unvested obligations totaled $22.3 million. Our working capital decreased by $18.7 million to $757.1 million as of January 31, 2023, as compared to $775.7 million at April 30, 2022. We believe that cash on hand and funds from operations and other forms of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements, repayment of debt obligations and dividend payments under our dividend policy in the next 12 months. We had a total of $1,145.3 million available under the Credit Facilities (defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) and a total of $645.3 million available under the previous credit facilities after $4.7 million of standby letters of credit issued as of both January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. We had a total of $11.6 million and $10.0 million of standby letters of credit with other financial institutions as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively .
The standby letters of credit were generally issued as a result of entering into office premise leases.

Fee revenue was $680.8 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023, essentially flat compared to $680.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates unfavorably impacted fee revenue by $23.2 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. Fee revenue decreased in Executive Search, Professional Search permanent placements and Digital, mainly due to a decline in demand for our products and services driven by the global economic slowdown. This decrease was fully offset by increases in RPO and Interim fee revenue. The Acquired Companies were the primary reason for the increase in Interim fee revenue compared to the year-ago quarter.

Executive Search North America reported fee revenue of $132.8 million, a decrease of $19.8 million, or 13%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $152.6 million in the year-ago quarter. North America’s fee revenue was lower due to a 10% decrease in the number of engagements billed, combined with a 3% decrease in the weighted-average fee billed per engagement (calculated using local currency) during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. Executive Search EMEA . Executive Search EMEA reported fee revenue of $49.0 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $47.5 million in the year-ago quarter.

Performance in Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland were the primary contributors to the increase in fee revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter, partially offset by a decrease in fee revenue in France and Italy. 37 Executive Search Asia Pacific.
Executive Search Asia Pacific reported fee revenue of $22.6 million, a decrease of $8.8 million, or 28%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $31.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates unfavorably impacted fee revenue by $2.2 million, or 7%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter.
The decrease in fee revenue was due to a 17% decrease in the number of engagements billed, and 7% decrease in the weighted-average fee billed per engagement (calculated using local currency) during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The performance in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore were the primary contributors to the decrease in fee revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. Executive Search Latin America.
Executive Search Latin America reported fee revenue of $7.7 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $7.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates favorably impacted fee revenue by $0.2 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The slight increase in fee revenue was due to a 3% increase in the weighted-average fees billed per engagement (calculated using local currency), partially offset by a 2% decrease in the number of engagements billed during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter.
The increase in fee revenue was due to higher fee revenue in Argentina and Brazil in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter, partially offset by a decrease in fee revenue in Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. Professional Search & Interim.
Professional Search & Interim reported fee revenue of $118.0 million, an increase of $28.0 million, or 31%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $90.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates unfavorably impacted fee revenue by $1.6 million, or 2%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter.

This increase was partially offset by a decrease in permanent placement fee revenue of $10.0 million. RPO.
RPO reported fee revenue of $103.5 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 5%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $98.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates unfavorably impacted fee revenue by $3.8 million, or 4%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in fee revenue was due to wider adoption of RPO services in the market in combination with our differentiated solutions. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $33.5 million, or 8%, to $479.4 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from $445.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates favorably impacted compensation and benefits by $12.4 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter.
The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and related payroll taxes of
$36.2
million and employee insurance of $3.2 million due to an increase in average headcount of
19% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter and wage inflation. Also contributing to higher compensation and benefit expense was an increase in deferred compensation expenses of $21.4 million as a result of an increase in the fair value of participants' accounts compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was partially offset by lower performance-related bonus expense of $23.6 million and a decrease in the amortization of long-term incentive awards of $3.9 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. Compensation and benefits expense, as a percentage of fee revenue, increased to 70% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from 65% in the year-ago quarter. Consulting compensation and benefits expense increased by $4.3 million, or 4%, to $118.1 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from $113.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates favorably impacted compensation and benefits by $3.8 million, or 3%, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The
increase in compensation and benefits expense
was primarily due to increases in
salaries and related payroll taxes of
$6.0
million, employee insurance of $0.5 million
and amortization of long-term incentive awards of $0.6 million
due to an increase in average headcount of 7% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter and wage inflation. Additionally, an increase in deferred compensation expense of $1.9 million due to an increase in the fair value of participants' account also contributed to the increase in compensation and benefits expense. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in performance-related bonus expense of $5.4 million. Consulting compensation and benefits expense, as a percentage of fee revenue, increased to 73% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from 70% in the year-ago quarter. Digital compensation and benefits expense was $46.5 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $46.4 million in the year-ago quarter, essentially flat.

Digital compensation and benefits expense, as a percentage of fee revenue, increased to 55% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from 51% in the year-ago quarter. 38 Executive Search North America compensation and benefits expense increased by $12.8 million, or 14%, to $103.6 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $90.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Exchange rates favorably impacted compensation and benefits by $0.3 million, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to increases in deferred compensation expense of $15.8 million as a result of an increase in the fair value of the participants' accounts, coupled with an increase in salaries and related payroll taxes of $3.0 million driven by an increase in average headcount of 7% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter and wage inflation. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in performance-related bonus of $4.2 million due to the lower segment fee revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter, and a decline in the amortization of long-term incentive awards of $1.8 million. Executive Search North America compensation and benefits expense, as a percentage of fee revenue, increased to 78% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from 60% in the year-ago quarter.

Next, the Company’s capital allocation approach contemplates the return of a portion of excess capital to stockholders, in the form of a regular quarterly dividend, subject to the factors discussed below and in the “Risk Factors” section of the Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company considers share repurchases on an opportunistic basis and subject to the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement (defined below), as well as using excess cash to repay the Notes.

The Notes represent senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.
We may redeem the Notes prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture governing the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). The indenture governing the Notes requires that, upon the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Decline (each as defined in the indenture), we shall make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest.
We used the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay $276.9 million outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility and to pay expenses and fees in connection therewith. As of January 31, 2023, the fair value of the Notes was $377.0 million, which is based on borrowing rates currently required of notes with similar terms, maturity and credit risk.

The Amended Credit Agreement provides for five-year senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $1,150 million comprised of a $650.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $500 million delayed draw term loan facility (the “Delayed Draw Facility”, and together with the Revolver, the “Credit Facilities”). The Amended Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, the Company may incur term loans or increase the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments by an aggregate amount of up to $250 million plus an unlimited amount subject to a consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00.

$11.6 million and $10.0 million
of standby letters with other financial institutions as of January 31, 2023 and

Every quarter since the adoption of the dividend policy, the Company has declared a quarterly dividend. On June 21, 2021, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. On June 21, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share. The Amended Credit Agreement permits us to pay dividends to our stockholders and make share repurchases so long as there is no default under the Amended Credit Agreement, our total funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, the “consolidated net leverage ratio”) is no greater than 5.00 to 1.00, and we are in pro forma compliance with our financial covenant.
Furthermore, our Notes allow us to pay $25 million of dividends per fiscal year with no restrictions plus an unlimited amount of dividends so long as our consolidated total leverage ratio is not greater than 3.50 to 1.00, and there is no default under the indenture governing the Notes. The declaration and payment of future dividends under the quarterly dividend program will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, the terms of our indebtedness and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. On June 21, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of approximately $300 million, which at the time brought our available capacity to repurchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions to $318 million. The Company repurchased approximately
$80.5 million
and
$31.5 million
of the Company’s stock during nine
months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively. As of
January 31, 2023 ,
$248.6
million remained available for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase program. Any decision to continue to execute our currently outstanding share repurchase program will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. Our primarily source of liquidity is the fee revenue generated from our operations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Agreement. Our performance is subject to the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and the industries we service. We believe, based on current economic conditions, that our cash on hand and funds from operations and the Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments under our dividend policy during the next 12 months. However, if the national or global economy, credit market conditions and/or labor markets continue to deteriorate in the future, including as a result of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty due to inflation and a potential recession, such changes have and could put further negative pressure on demand for our services and affect our operating cash flows. If these conditions were to persist over an extended period of time, we may incur negative cash flows and it might require us to access additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to meet our capital needs and/or discontinue our share repurchases and dividend policy.
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1,007.8 million and $1,211.1 million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Net of amounts held in trust for deferred compensation plans and accrued bonuses, cash and marketable securities were $531.4 million and $605.4 million at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we held $358.6 million and $416.7 million, respectively of cash and cash equivalents in foreign locations, net of amounts held in trust for deferred compensation plans and to pay accrued bonuses. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities consist of mutual funds and investments in commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities. The primary objectives of our investment in mutual funds are to meet the obligations under certain of our deferred compensation plans, while the commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities are available for general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, marketable securities of $235.9 million and $233.0 million, respectively, included equity securities of $188.8 million (net of gross unrealized gains of $10.8 million and gross unrealized losses of $9.0 million) and $168.7 million (net of gross unrealized gains of $ 10.7
million and gross unrealized losses of $ 6.1
million), respectively, were held in trust for settlement of our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans, of which $180.3 million and $158.7 million, respectively, are classified as non-current. These marketable securities were held to satisfy vested obligations totaling $173.7 million and $160.8 million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Unvested obligations under the deferred compensation plans totaled $22.3 million and $24.0 million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively.
The net decrease in our working capital of $18.7 million as of January 31, 2023 compared to April 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits payable combined with an increase in account receivables. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and compensation and benefits payable was primarily due to payments of annual bonuses earned in fiscal 2022 and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and the acquisition of ICS in second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in days of sales outstanding, which went from 58 days to 71 days (which is consistent with historical experience) from April 30, 2022 to January 31, 2023. The increase in other accrued
50 liabilities was due to an increase in accrued restructuring due to restructuring charges, net recorded in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and an increase in deferred revenue. Cash provided by operating activities was $92.8 million in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023, a decrease of $128.7 million, compared to the cash provided by operating activities of $221.5 million in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2022. Cash used in investing activities was $165.4 million in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $136.6 million in the year-ago period. An increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increases in cash paid for property and equipment of $21.4 million and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $8.5 million, partially offset by the decrease in the purchase of marketable securities net of sales/maturities of $2.5 million during the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the year-ago period. Cash used in financing activities was $130.1 million in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $62.8 million in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due increases in repurchases of the Company’s common stock, dividends paid to shareholders, cash used to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of restricted stock, dividends to noncontrolling interest and payments on life insurance policy loans of $53.5 million, $4.7 million, $3.9 million, $3.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to none in the year-ago quarter.
Cash Surrender Value of Company-Owned Life Insurance Policies, Net of Loans We purchased COLI policies or contracts insuring the lives of certain employees eligible to participate in the deferred compensation and pension plans as a means of funding benefits under such plans. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we held contracts with gross cash surrender value of $276.2 million and $263.2 million, respectively. Total outstanding borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts was $77.6 million and $79.8 million as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Such borrowings do not require annual principal repayments, bear interest primarily at variable rates and are secured by the CSV of COLI contracts. At January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the net cash surrender value of these policies was $198.6 million and $183.3 million, respectively. Other than the factors discussed in this section, we are not aware of any other trends, demands or commitments that would materially affect liquidity or those that relate to our resources as of January 31, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated, special purpose entities. We had no material changes in contractual obligations as of January 31, 2023, as compared to those disclosed in our table of contractual obligations included in our Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations as new information is learned or upon the amounts becoming fixed or determinable. In preparing our interim consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the policies related to revenue recognition, performance-related bonuses, deferred compensation, carrying values of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, leases and recoverability of deferred income taxes as critical to an understanding of our interim consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since the end of fiscal 2022. Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a result of our global operating activities, we are exposed to certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below.
Foreign Currency Risk Substantially all our foreign subsidiaries’ operations are measured in their local currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at daily rates of exchange during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on our consolidated balance sheets. 51 Transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity’s functional currency may give rise to foreign currency gains or losses that impact our results of operations. Historically, we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions. During the
nine
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded foreign currency losses of $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is primarily driven by fluctuations involving the following currencies — U.S. Dollar, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Euro, Swiss Franc, and Mexican Peso. Based on balances exposed to fluctuation in exchange rates between these currencies as of January 31, 2023, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of these currencies could result in a foreign exchange gain or loss of $11.6 million. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. These foreign currency forward contracts are neither used for trading purposes nor are they designated as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815,
Derivatives and Hedging . Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our Credit Facilities, borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts
and to a lesser extent our fixed income debt securities . As of January 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. At our option, loans issued under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The interest rate applicable to loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement may fluctuate between Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1.125% per annum to 2.00% per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.125% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum, in the alternative), based upon our total funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, the “consolidated net
leverage ratio”) at such time. In addition, we are required to pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.300% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Revolver, based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio at such time, a ticking fee of 0.20% per annum on the actual daily unused portion of the Delayed Draw Facility during the availability period of the Delayed Draw Facility, and fees relating to the issuance of letters of credit. We had $77.6 million and $79.8 million of borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, bearing interest primarily at variable rates. The risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate, which has the effect of increasing the CSV on our COLI contracts. Item 4.
Controls and Procedures a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures conducted as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) were effective as of January 31, 2023. b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 52 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in litigation both as a plaintiff and a defendant, relating to claims arising out of our operations. As of the date of this report, we are not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors In our Form 10-K, we described the material factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. Those risk factors should be considered carefully, together with all other information in that Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. It does not address all of the risks that we face, and additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also arise and impair our business operations. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table summarizes common stock repurchased by us during the quarter ended January 31, 2023:

(2) On June 21, 2022,
our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of $300 million. The shares can be repurchased in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion. The share repurchase program has no expiration date. We repurchased approximately $25.0 million of the Company’s common stock under the program during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our Amended Credit Agreement permits us to pay dividends to our stockholders and make share repurchases so long as there is no default under our Amended Credit Agreement, the consolidated net leverage ratio, which uses adjusted EBITDA, is no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 and we are in pro forma compliance with our financial covenant. Furthermore, our Notes allow the Company to pay $25 million of dividends per fiscal year with no restrictions plus an unlimited amount of dividends so long as the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio is not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and the Company is not in default under the indenture governing the Notes. 53 Item 6.
