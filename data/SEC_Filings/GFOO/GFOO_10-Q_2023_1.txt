NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 – GENERAL ORGANIZATION
AND BUSINESS
Genufood
Energy Enzymes Corp., USA (the “Company” or “GEEC”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on
June 21, 2010. On February 13, 2012, GEEC incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Genufood Enzymes (S) Pte Ltd (“GESPL”) in
Singapore, which ceased its operations
on January 9, 2023.
Since its
inception, the Company has always been in the development stage and never generated significant revenues. The Company is currently developing
business in Electric Vehicle Charge station. The Company has engaged in business agreements and development with various parties. During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company has initiated its electric vehicle charging station business.
The Company
made two investments in Hukui Biotechnology Corporation (“Hukui”) by purchasing  80,000  shares of Hukui’s Series
C Preferred Stock for $ 800,000  on December 15, 2020; and purchasing  60,000  shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock
for $ 600,000  on June 25, 2021. The Company, an individual and resident of the Republic of China (the “Purchaser”), and
Hukui, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2021, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell these  140,000  shares
of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock (the “Hukui Shares”) to the Purchaser for $ 350,000  in cash, or $ 2.50  per
share. The sale of the Hukui Shares closed on November 19, 2021.
On August 1, 2022, the
board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company unanimously approved to expand our business in the area of electric vehicle
supply equipment (“EVSE”) and will direct the management team to implement its new business plan in such industry. On August
16, 2022, the Company formally announced its intention to reposition as EVSE solutions provider, seeking to grow business in EVSE industry,
including building, owning, and operating the next generation of electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. The Company intends to
bring convenient, reliable, and accessible charging experience to electric vehicle drivers, utilizing frictionless technology and carbon-neutral
vehicle-charging infrastructure.
On October 26, 2022,
the Company entered into three Charging Station Site Host Agreements (the “Agreements”) with two institutions (the “Site
Hosts”), respectively, pursuant to which the Site Hosts agree to allow the Company to install its electric vehicle charging stations
at the locations set forth in the Agreements (the “Charging Stations”). Under the Agreements, the Company has agreed to share
the revenue generated by the sales of electricity at the Charging Stations with the Site Hosts in accordance with the schedules set forth
therein.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has purchased
certain electric vehicle charging equipment. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of obtaining permits to construct the Charging
Stations at the three confirmed sites. As of December 31, 2022, the Company contracted an architectural firm on providing designing and
engineering services for two sites, and working on technical issues for the third site.
As of February 13, 2023, the Company has received
the finalized site plans and electrical diagrams from the architectural firm and electrical engineers for 2 sites. The Company has also
received permission from the site owners to proceed with the charging station construction permit applications with the local municipalities.
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The Company’s
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (“US GAAP”). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for
the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending September 30, 2023. These
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Principle of Consolidation
The condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GEEC and its wholly-owned subsidiary GESPL. All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company did not have business activities during
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Use of
Estimates
The preparation
of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

GENUFOOD ENERGY ENZYMES
CORP
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consisted primarily of cash, to the extent
balances exceeded limits that were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company does not require collateral and maintains
reserves for potential credit losses. Such losses have historically been immaterial and have been within management’s expectations.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The Company
considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. As of December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not have cash equivalents. The Company’s cash was denominated in United States
Dollars (“USD”) or New Taiwan Dollars (“TWD”) and was placed with banks in the United States of America and Taiwan.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The Company
follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”), with respect
to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
●
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
●
Level 3 inputs are less observable and reflect our own assumptions.
The Company’s
financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses and due to related parties.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to
their relatively short-term nature. It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit
risks arising from these financial instruments.
Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions
The reporting
and functional currency of GEEC is the USD. The functional currency of GESPL, a wholly owned subsidiary of GEEC, is the Singapore Dollar
(“SGD”).
For financial
reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company’s Singapore subsidiary, which are prepared using the SGD, are translated
into the Company’s reporting currency, USD.  Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date, which was 0.7464 and 0.6970 as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Revenue and expenses are translated using
average exchange rates prevailing during each reporting period.  The  0.7214  and  0.7370  average exchange rates
were used to translate revenues and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stockholders’
equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ deficit.
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange difference, presented as foreign currency transaction loss, is included in the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Business
Segments
The Company
operates in only  one  segment.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company
calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed
similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. There
were no potential dilutive debt or equity instruments issued and outstanding at any time during the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.
Discounts
on Common Stock
Common stock
issued lower than the Company’s par value is treated as common stock issued under discounts. The portion of the discount is shown
separately as a deduction from the Company’s account of common stock on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company
accounts for its stock-based compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under FASB
ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, which requires the Company to expense the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments over the vesting period.
Income
Taxes
Income taxes
are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce the Company’s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company
considers positive and negative evidence when determining whether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not
be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts
of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its
tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable
income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible.
When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards,
(iii) future taxable income arising from implementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be
reflected within the industry.

GENUFOOD ENERGY ENZYMES
CORP
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
The Company
recognizes a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in its judgment, it is more likely than not that the position
will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold,
the Company initially and subsequently measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that the Company judges to have a greater than  50 %
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company’s liability associated with unrecognized
tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new
or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Company’s effective
tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate
by management. The Company classifies interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
There were
no current and deferred income tax provision recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 since the Company is in developing
stage and did not generate any revenues in the two fiscal periods.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The Company
considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs” or “ASU”) on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to
have minimal impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently issued ASUs that the Company
feels may be applicable to the Company are as follows:
In August
2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and
Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The subtitle is Accounting for Convertible Instruments
and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. This ASU addresses complex financial instruments that have characteristics of both debt
and equity. The application of this ASU would reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible
preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models would result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the
host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with
embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative,
and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial
premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. To date, no such bifurcation has been necessary. Management is evaluating
the potential impact. This ASU becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023.
NOTE
3 – GOING CONCERN
As of December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 10,128,993  and $ 9,922,955 , respectively. To date, the
Company’s cash flow requirements have been primarily met through proceeds received from sales of Common Stock and investment. These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and
liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.
The Company sold the  140,000  Hukui
Shares for $ 350,000  cash on November 19, 2021. The proceeds have been used for operation expenses. Management is currently seeking
additional funds for the Company’s future operation.

NOTE
5 – INVESTMENT
Pursuant
to that certain Series C Preferred Shares Subscription Agreement dated September 23, 2020 between the Company and Hukui (the “Hukui
Agreement”), the Company agreed to purchase an aggregate  200,000  Series C Preferred Shares, at $ 10.00  per share,
for an aggregate investment of $ 2,000,000 , in a series of three closings from December 15, 2020 through June 30, 2022. On December 15,
2020, the Company purchased  80,000  shares of Series C Preferred Stock at $ 10.00  per share, for a total purchase price of
$ 800,000 ; and on June 25, 2021, the Company purchased an additional  60,000  shares of Series C Preferred Stock at $ 10.00  per
share, for a total purchase price of $ 600,000 . The total $ 1,400,000  investment consists of less than  20 % of Hukui’s total
equity with no significant control over or influence on Hukui. The investment is recorded at cost.
On November
17, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell all  140,000  Hukui Shares at $ 2.50  per share for a
total of $ 350,000 . The sale was completed on November 19, 2021, resulting in loss of $ 1,050,000 . The Company recognized impairment loss
of the market value of the shares of $ 1,050,000  for the year ended September 30, 2021.
NOTE
6 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)
The Company
is authorized under its articles of incorporation, as amended, to issue  10,000,000,000  shares of Common Stock, par value $ 0.001  per
share.
Stock
Options
On July
15, 2022, the CEO, David Tang, was granted  15,000,000  options to purchase shares at $ 0.01  per share. As of December 31,
2022, total options granted was  15,000,000  and none was vested. This option will be subject to a vesting schedule providing
for twenty-five percent ( 25 %) vesting after the first twelve (12) months of employment and monthly vesting as to the remaining seventy-five

These stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of  10  years from the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair
value of options granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $ 0.02 .
Compensation
costs associated with the Company’s stock options are recognized, based on the grant-date fair value of these options, over the
requisite service period, or vesting period. Accordingly, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 75,000  and
$ 0 , respectively, which was included in the general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

NOTE 8 – INCOME TAXES
The Company
has not generated any revenue from any source in the United States and had consolidated net loss for all the years since inception in
2010. Management believes GEEC does not have any U.S. income tax liability due. However, even though the Company does not have U.S. income
tax liability, it may be required to file Form 5471 each year with the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) of Department
of Treasury. GEEC falls in the Category Five Filer (as a domestic corporation). The Company used to have subsidiaries: GEECIS in Sri Lanka
that was established in May 2011, GESPL in Singapore that was established in February 2012, and GESTL in Thailand that was established
in December 2014. The subsidiaries in Sri Lanka and Thailand were disposed in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and the Singapore subsidiary
has been inactive since 2016.
Internal
Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 6038(a) requires information reporting with respect to certain foreign corporations (Form 5471)
and describes the information required to be reported on this form. IRC Section 6038(b)(1) provides for a monetary penalty of $ 10,000  for
each Form 5471 that is filed after the due date of the income tax return (including extensions) or does not include the complete and accurate
information described in Section 6038(a). According to IRS rules, a penalty may apply to each Form 5471 which is filed after the due date
of the income tax return. The penalty will be applied whether or not any tax is due on Form 1120.
The Company
believes that based on the current information available, it is difficult to determine whether it is probable that the Company will be
charged penalties by IRS for the late filing of Form 5471 and even if it will be, it is difficult to reasonably estimate the amount of
penalties that may be assessed.
During the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the IRS imposed a $ 25,000  penalty on the Company for failure to file Form 5472, Information
Return of a  25 % Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business, for the year ended September
30, 2020. The Company has engaged an outside professional advisor to seek for forgiveness of the penalty and interest thereon in the amount
of $ 4,976 , for a total of $ 29,976 , which was still pending as of December 31, 2022.

10 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company
has closed GESPL, its Singapore subsidiary, as of January 9, 2023. GESPL does not have any operation.
Management
has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date when the consolidated
financial statements were issued and determined that no subsequent events occurred that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than
statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including,
but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives
of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future
economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.
Forward-looking
statements may include the words “may,” “could,” “will,” “estimate,” “intend,”
“continue,” “believe,” “expect”, “anticipate”, “hope” or other similar words.
These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for our ongoing obligation
to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update
any forward-looking statement.
Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially
from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as
well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. Some of the key factors impacting
these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
● risks
related to our ability to identify, pursue and commence a reverse merger and/or a possible operating business;
● our
ability to obtain adequate funding to complete a reverse merger or commence a possible operating business and meet our operating expenses
on a current basis;
● general
economic uncertainty, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise;
● delays
in our ability to obtain any necessary business licenses and permits, and commence business operations, whether as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic or otherwise; and
●
current and longer-term
economic and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, results of operations and financial condition, including without
limitation changes in consumer spending patterns for non-essential products, resulting from the economic crisis caused by lockdown,
shelter-in-place, stay-at-home or similar orders instituted as a result of the pandemic, or otherwise.
Overview
On August 1, 2022, the board of directors (the “Board”)
of the Company unanimously approved to expand our business in the area of electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”) and will
direct the management team to implement its new business plan in such industry. On August 16, 2022, the Company formally announced its
intention to reposition as EVSE solutions provider, seeking to grow business in EVSE industry, including building, owning, and operating
the next generation of electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. The Company intends to bring convenient, reliable, and accessible
charging experience to electric vehicle drivers, utilizing frictionless technology and carbon-neutral vehicle-charging infrastructure.
On
October 26, 2022, we entered into three Charging Station Site Host Agreements (the “Agreements”) with two institutions (the
“Site Hosts”), respectively, pursuant to which the Site Hosts agree to allow us to install our electric vehicle charging
stations at the locations set forth in the Agreements (the “Charging Stations”). Under the Agreements, we have agreed to
share our revenue generated by the sales of electricity at the Charging Stations with the Site Hosts in accordance with the schedules
set forth therein.
As of December 31, 2022, the
Company has purchased certain electric vehicle charging equipment. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of obtaining permits to
construct the Charging Stations at the three confirmed sites. As of December 31, 2022, the Company contracted an architectural firm on
providing designing and engineering services for two sites, and working on technical issues for the third site.
As of February 13, 2023, the
Company has received the finalized site plans and electrical diagrams from the architectural firm and electrical engineers for 2 sites.
The Company has also received permission from the site owners to proceed with the charging station construction permit applications with
the local municipalities. The Company expects to install up to a total of 10 charging units for the first 2 sites, and have them operational
in April of 2023.

Hukui
Investment
Hukui
Biotechnology Corporation (“Hukui”) and we entered into a Series C Preferred Shares Subscription Agreement dated September
23, 2020 (the “Hukui Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase an aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui’s Series
C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Shares”) at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of $2,000,000.
The
Hukui Agreement provided that we would purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30,
2022, as follows:
● The
first tranche is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $800,000 (the “First Tranche Investment”), such shares
having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020 (the “First Tranche Closing”);
● The
second tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Second Tranche Investment”), such shares
having been purchased by us on June 25, 2021 (the “Second Tranche Closing”); and
●
The third tranche is 60,000
Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Third Tranche Investment”), such shares to have been purchased
on or before June 30, 2022 (the “Third Tranche Closing”).
An
individual and resident of the Republic of China (the “Purchaser”), Hukui and we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated as of November 17, 2021 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell the 140,000 shares of
Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock that we had purchased in the First Tranche Closing and the Second Tranche Closing (the “Hukui
Shares”) to the Purchaser for $350,000 in cash, or $2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares closed on November 19, 2021.
On
December 17, 2021, Hukui and we entered into an Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which our obligation
to make the Third Tranche Investment was terminated and the Hukui Agreement was terminated. As a result, we have no continuing contractual
obligation to make any investment in Hukui.

Results of Operations
Three Months
Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenues
We
did not generate any revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Operating Expenses
We incurred total
operating expenses of $205,245 and $103,340 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our operating
expenses consist of legal fees, other professional fees, payroll expenses, stock-based compensation, rent, bank charges, and
transfer agent fees. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in
2021 was primarily due to the increase in payroll expenses, and stock-based compensation.
Other expense
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $793 other expenses mainly due to interest incurred for unpaid penalty from IRS.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $747 other expenses mainly due to interest incurred for unpaid penalty from
IRS.
Net Loss
As
a result of the above, our net loss increased from $104,087 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $206,038 in the same period
ended in 2022.
Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our
Business
While
our liquidity and capital resources are severely limited and present serious obstacles to starting a business, these limitations are unrelated
to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global economic crisis.
Our
personnel are in Taiwan, which has been relatively less affected by the pandemic compared to many other countries in Asia, Europe and
the United States. However, even before an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan, we experienced delays in obtaining business
licenses and permits, and any other governmental approvals that might have been required for businesses that we previously considered
commencing, since government offices have been working with reduced staff during the pandemic. We expect this situation to continue and
possibly become more challenging depending upon the duration of the pandemic.
Depending
upon the extent and duration of the pandemic and the resulting global economic crisis, these conditions may have an adverse impact on
our ability to raise capital and commence any business we may pursue.

As

had current assets of $150,893 and a working capital deficit of $54,123.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of $68,188, compared with total assets of $150,893 at September 30, 2022. The decrease in total
assets was primarily due to cash spent in operating expenses.
We
had $252,684 in total current liabilities as of December 31, 2022, consisting of $118,471 in accounts payable and $134,213 due to related
parties. This is compared to total current liabilities of $205,016 as of September 30, 2022, consisting of $102,185 in accounts payable
and $102,831 due to related parties. The increase in due to related parties was primarily due to unpaid compensation to officers and directors.
We
had total stockholders’ deficit of $214,472 and an accumulated deficit of $10,128,993 as of December 31, 2022. In comparison, we
had a total stockholders’ deficit of $83,349 and an accumulated deficit of $9,922,955 as of September 30, 2022.

During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $74,869 of cash in operating activities which was attributable primarily to our net
loss of $206,038 offset by stock-based compensation and change in operating assets and liabilities of $131,169. In comparison, during
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we used $71,538 of cash in operating activities which was attributable primarily to our net
loss of $104,087 offset by change in operating assets and liabilities of $32,549.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $15,005 of cash in investing activities for the purchase of equipment. We received $350,000
in payment for the sale of the 140,000 Hukui Shares during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any financing activity.
There
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our expenses as they become due. We do not anticipate any significant additional revenue until we continue to implement our electric vehicle
charging station business operations and begin to profit from our business operations. There is no assurance that we will ever reach that
stage. The condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that we cannot
continue as a going concern.
Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan and generate profitable
operations in the future, and, until and unless we achieve that, to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operation as and when they become due. To date, our capital requirements have primarily been
funded by shareholders through the purchase of our Common Stock in private offerings and short-term borrowings from a former officer and
another shareholder.
The
Company sold the 140,000 Hukui Shares for $350,000 cash on November 19, 2021. The proceeds have been used for operation
expenses.
16
Contractual Obligations
We
do not have material contractual obligations and commitments. We only have one lease that is renewed on a month-to-month basis.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022, we had not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations
of any third parties. As of December 31, 2022, we had not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified
as shareholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, as of December
31, 2022, we had not had any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit,
liquidity or market risk support to such entity. As of December 31, 2022, we had not had any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity
that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services
with us.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those
related to income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates
and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no significant
estimates and assumptions have been made in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following are some of the critical accounting
policies in relation to the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a full summary of our critical accounting
policies, please refer to Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency
translation
The
financial statements of our subsidiary denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD using the closing rate method.
The balance sheet items are translated into USD using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various
reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated
at the average exchange rate for the period. All exchange differences are recorded in stockholders’ equity.
Stock-Based Compensation
We
account for stock-based compensation in which we obtain employee services in share-based payment transactions under FASB ASC Topic 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation, which requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments over the vesting period.
Recent accounting pronouncements
We
do not expect that the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows. For a full summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Currency exchange rates
For
financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company’s Singapore subsidiary, which are prepared using the SGD,
are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, USD. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on
the balance sheet date, which was 0.7464 and 0.6970 as of December 31, and September 30, 2022, respectively. Revenue and expenses are
translated using average exchange rates prevailing during each reporting period. The 0.7214 and 0.7370 average
exchange rates were used to translate revenues and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stockholders’
equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ deficit.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information relating to our Company, including our consolidated subsidiary,
required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based
on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described
below.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and identified the
following material weaknesses:
Inadequate
Segregation of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures.
Comingling
of funds:
We do not have adequate control of our petty cash, resulting in the comingling of our petty cash with the nominal account
holder’s personal funds.
Lack
of Adequate Staffing:
We do not have adequate in-house accounting personnel and expertise in key positions, which resulted in overly
relying on outside consultants in preparing financial statements and other required disclosures by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Ineffective
oversight:
We do not exercise effective oversight and monitoring procedures designed and implemented to certain control activities.
Overly
relied on outside professionals:
We are unable to prepare internally financial statements and relied on outside professional consultants
to prepare financial statements and adequate disclosures.
18
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified above,
management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022  based
on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by COSO.
Due
to the nature of the material weaknesses, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual
or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. The material weaknesses identified above either
individually or in aggregation did not result in any identified misstatements or errors in the Company’s condensed consolidated
financial statements at and for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022.
Management’s
Plan for Remediation
Management
has discussed the material weaknesses noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Management is committed to
improving its internal controls and, subject to having adequate financial resources, intends to:
● increase
the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties to monitor
and review until there are sufficient personnel to segregate duties;
● consider
providing professional courses for our key position personnel;
● hire
additional employees to realize segregation of duties; and
● strengthen
management monitoring control over accounting and financial statements preparation processing.
However,
due to limitation of funds and personnel, we have so far been unable to begin to implement the plan to remediate the material weaknesses
noted above and it is uncertain when we will be able to begin to implement the plan to remediate these material weaknesses.
Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s
objectives will be met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
control issues or misstatements. Accordingly, our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of our control system are met. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become adequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Changes
in Internal Control
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
