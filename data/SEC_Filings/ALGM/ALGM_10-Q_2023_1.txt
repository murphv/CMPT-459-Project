Exhibits 42 Signatures 43 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, the impact of the ongoing and global COVID-19 pandemic on our business, prospective products and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, may be forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding the liquidity, growth and profitability strategies and factors and trends affecting our business are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “aim,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “exploring,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “seek,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results, performance, or achievements, and one should avoid placing undue reliance on such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. Such beliefs and assumptions may or may not prove to be correct. Additionally, such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to, those identified in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 25, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on August 29, 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Annual Report”) as any such factors may be updated from time to time in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • downturns or volatility in general economic conditions, including as a result of an economic recession or the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the automotive market; • our ability to compete effectively, expand our market share and increase our net sales and profitability; • our reliance on a limited number of third-party wafer fabrication facilities and suppliers of other materials; • our failure to adjust purchase commitments, supply chain volume and inventory management based on changing market conditions or customer demand; • shifts in our product mix or customer mix, which could negatively impact our gross margin; • the cyclical nature of the analog semiconductor industry; • our ability to compensate for decreases in average selling prices of our products and increases in input costs; • increases in inflation rates or sustained periods of inflation in the markets in which we operate;
• any disruptions at our primary third-party wafer fabrication facilities; • our ability to manage any sustained yield problems or other delays at our third-party wafer fabrication facilities or in the final assembly and test of our products; • our ability to fully realize the benefits of past and potential future initiatives designed to improve our competitiveness, growth and profitability; • our ability to accurately predict our quarterly net sales and operating results; • our dependence on manufacturing operations in the Philippines; • our reliance on distributors to generate sales; • COVID-19 induced lock-downs and suppression on our supply chain and customer demand; • our ability to develop new product features or new products in a timely and cost-effective manner; • our ability to manage growth; • any slowdown in the growth of our end markets; • the loss of one or more significant customers; • our ability to meet customers’ quality requirements; • uncertainties related to the design win process and our ability to recover design and development expenses and to generate timely or sufficient net sales or margins; 2 • changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions; • our exposures to warranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls; • our dependence on international customers and operations; • the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives on end-user demands for certain products; • risks related to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including privacy, data protection, information security, consumer protection, environmental and occupational health and safety, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and trade controls; • the volatility of currency exchange rates; • our indebtedness may limit our flexibility to operate our business; • our ability to retain key and highly skilled personnel; • our ability to protect our proprietary technology and inventions through patents or trade secrets; • our ability to commercialize our products without infringing third-party intellectual property rights; • disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems or those of our third-party service providers; • our principal stockholders have substantial control over us; • the inapplicability of the “corporate opportunity” doctrine to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us; • the dilutive impact on the price of our shares upon future issuance by us or future sales by our stockholders; • our lack of intent to declare or pay dividends for the foreseeable future; • anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; • the exclusive forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation for disputes with stockholders; • our inability to design, implement or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; • changes in tax rates or the adoption of new tax legislation; and • other events beyond our control. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Allegro” refer to the operations of Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 3 PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1.

Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation Allegro MicroSystems, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a global leader in designing, developing and manufacturing sensing and power solutions for motion control and energy-efficient systems in automotive and industrial markets. The Company is headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire and has a global footprint across multiple continents. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 25, 2022 filed with the SEC on May 18, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on August 29, 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Annual Report”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the financial statements for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. Financial Periods
The Company’s third quarter three-month period is a 13-week period. The Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2023 ended December 23, 2022, and the Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2022 ended December 24, 2021. 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, allowances for expected credit losses and customer returns and sales allowances. Such estimates could also relate to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangible assets, net realizable value of inventory, accrued liabilities, the valuation of stock-based awards, deferred tax valuation allowances, and other reserves. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to current-period reporting classifications. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, that management believes are of a high credit quality. To manage credit risk related to accounts receivables, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and maintains allowances, to the extent necessary, for potential credit losses based upon the aging of its accounts receivable balances and known collection issues. The Company has not experienced any significant credit losses during the prior two years. As of December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, Sanken Electric Co., Ltd. (“Sanken”) accounted for
24.1 % and
23.8 % of the Company’s outstanding trade accounts receivable, net, respectively, including related party trade accounts receivable. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of outstanding trade accounts receivable, as of those dates. For the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022, Sanken accounted
fo r
18.1 % and
18.7 % of total net sales, respectively. For the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, Sanken accounted for
21.1 % and
19.7 % of total net sales, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total net sales for the three- and nine-month

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021. See Note 18, “Related Party Transactions” for a discussion of the Transition Agreement (as defined below) between Sanken and the Company to transition the marketing and sale of the Company’s products in Japan from Sanken to the Company during the twelve-month transition period beginning on September 29, 2022. During the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, sales to customers located outside of the United States accounted for, in the aggregate,
86.5 % of the Company’s total net sales, with Greater China accounting for
25.8 %, Japan accounting for
18.1 % and South Korea accounting for
10.3 %. During the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, sales to customers located outside of the United States accounted for, in the aggregate,
87.6 % of the Company’s total net sales, with Greater China accounting for
25.9 % and Japan accounting for
18.7 %. No other country accounted for greater than 10% of total net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022. During the three-month period ended December 24, 2021, sales to customers located outside of the United States, in the aggregate, accounted for

19.7 % and South Korea accounting for
10.8 %. No other country accounted for greater than 10% of total net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
(“ASU 2021-08”), which eliminates the diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 require an acquiring entity to apply ASC Topic 606,
Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”), to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if the acquired contracts with customers were originated by the acquiring entity at the acquisition date. An acquirer may assess how the acquiree applied ASC 606 and generally should recognize and measure the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with the recognition and measurement in the acquiree’s financial statements, as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. If unable to rely on the acquiree’s accounting due to errors, noncompliance with U.S. GAAP, or differences in accounting policies, the acquirer should consider the terms of the acquired contracts, such as timing of payment, identify each performance obligation in the contracts, and allocate the total transaction price to each identified performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis as of contract inception (that is, the date the acquiree entered into the contracts) or contract modification to determine what should be recorded at the acquisition date.
The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08, effective March 26, 2022 and concluded that adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related disclosures. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)
(“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 outlines how an entity should account for modifications made to equity-classified written call options, including stock options and warrants to purchase the entity’s own common stock. The guidance in the ASU requires an entity to treat a modification of an equity-classified written call option that does not cause the option to become liability-classified as an exchange of the original option for a new option. This guidance applies whether the modification is structured as an amendment to the terms and conditions of the equity-classified written call option or as termination of the original option and issuance of a new option. The Company adopted ASU 2021-04, effective March 26, 2022, and concluded that it did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848
(“ASU 2022-06”). In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provided temporary relief when transitioning from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or another applicable rate during the original transition period ending on December 31, 2022. In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that the intended cessation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR would be June 30, 2023, which is beyond the current sunset date of Topic 848. In light of this development, the FASB issued this update to defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31,
11 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. The Company does not anticipate this new guidance to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related disclosures. 3.
Heyday Acquisition
On September 1, 2022, the Company completed its purchase of all of the equity interests in Heyday Integrated Circuits (“Heyday”), a privately held company specializing in compact, fully integrated isolated gate drivers that enable energy conversion in high-voltage gallium nitride and silicon carbide wide-bandgap semiconductor designs (the “Heyday Acquisition”). The Heyday Acquisition was undertaken to bring together Heyday’s isolated gate drivers and the Company’s isolated current sensors to enable potential development and commercialization of small high-voltage and high-efficiency power systems. Additionally, this acquisition is expected to increase the Company’s addressable market for electric vehicles (“xEV”), solar inverters, data center and 5G power supplies, and broad-market industrial applications. The total preliminary purchase price, as updated for measurement period adjustments, was $ 20,501 , consisting of cash consideration paid directly to the owners of Heyday and paid on their behalf for the settlement of certain outstanding debts and other obligations. The Heyday Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The allocation of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities is not yet finalized. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was based upon a preliminary valuation, and the Company’s estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized are the working capital settlement, finalization of our review of the estimates and assumptions included in the valuation reports, determination of the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and certain tax carry forwards, and residual goodwill. During the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to various accounts resulting in a decrease in goodwill of $ 450 .
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, updated for the measurement period adjustments above: As of
September 1, 2022 Cash $ 324   Property and equipment 16   Completed technology 15,100   In-process research and development 1,600   Assets acquired $ 17,040   Current liabilities assumed ( 282 ) Net deferred tax liability ( 4,036 ) Net assets acquired $ 12,722   Total estimated fair value of consideration ( 20,501 ) Goodwill $ 7,779   The significant intangible assets identified in the preliminary purchase price allocation consisted of completed technology and in-process research and development. Completed technology assets will be amortized over an estimated useful life of
12
years. The acquired in-process research and development costs was determined to have an indefinite useful life. Amortization of completed technology is included within cost of goods sold and consists of PowerThru technology that accomplishes gate driver power and signal transmission through an integrated transformer, reducing the size and complexity of the gate drive solution. The in-process research and development assets represent efforts to expand the power capability of these gate drivers for wide-bandgap semiconductor technology. To value the completed technology and the in-process research and development assets, the Company utilized the income approach, specifically a discounted cash-flow method known as the multi-period excess earnings method. Goodwill was recognized for the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill reflects the value of the synergies the Company expects to realize and the assembled workforce. Goodwill from the Heyday
12 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Acquisition is included within the Company’s
one
reporting unit and will be included in the Company’s enterprise-level annual review for impairment. Goodwill resulting from the Heyday Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the respective estimates of fair value as of the date of the acquisition and using assumptions that the Company’s management believes are reasonable given the information available as of the date of the Heyday Acquisition. The final allocation of the purchase price may differ materially from the information presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements. Any changes to the preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities, and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill. The revenues and income before income taxes from the Heyday Acquisition were immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022. The Company has not presented pro forma results of operations for the Heyday Acquisition because it is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 4.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company generates revenue from the sale of magnetic sensor integrated circuits (“ICs”) and application-specific analog power semiconductors. The following tables summarize net sales disaggregated by application, by product and by geography for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021.

In addition, the Company recognizes expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable as bad debt expense in the unaudited statements of operations. At December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, these combined adjustments were $ 18,896
and $ 14,924 , respectively, and were netted against trade accounts receivable in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. These amounts represent charges of $ 3,972
and $ 602
for the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021, respectively. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates. The Company elected not to disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year. 5.

Retirement Plans The Company recognizes the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations) of its defined benefit pension plans in its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. These amounts will continue to be recognized as a
19 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) component of future net periodic benefit costs consistent with the Company’s past practice. Further, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs that arise in future periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will also be recognized as a component of future net periodic benefit costs consistent with the Company’s past practice. The Company uses a measurement date for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that is equivalent to its fiscal year-end. Plan Descriptions Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Allegro MicroSystems Philippines, Inc. (“AMPI”), has a defined benefit pension plan, which is a noncontributory plan that covers substantially all employees of the respective subsidiary. The plan’s assets are invested in common trust funds, bonds and other debt instruments and stocks. Effect on the unaudited statements of operations Expense related to the non-United States (“U.S.”) defined benefit plan was as follows: Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Service cost $ 297   $ 365   $ 932   $ 1,119   Interest cost 179   158   561   485   Expected return on plan assets ( 71 ) ( 75 ) ( 222 ) ( 230 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 2 ) 1   ( 6 ) 1   Actuarial loss 20   51   60   156   Net periodic pension expense $ 423   $ 500   $ 1,325   $ 1,531   Information on Plan Assets The table below sets forth the fair value of the non-U.S. defined benefit plan’s assets as of December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, using the same three-level hierarchy of fair value inputs described in the significant accounting policies included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report. Fair Value at December 23, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plan: Government securities $ 2,104   $ 2,104   $ —   $ —   Unit investment trust fund 1,180   —   1,180   —   Loans 578   —   —   578   Bonds 677   —   677   —   Stocks and other investments 2,414   1,323   3   1,088   Total $ 6,953   $ 3,427   $ 1,860   $ 1,666   Fair Value at March 25, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plan: Government securities $ 1,920   $ 1,920   $ —   $ —   Unit investment trust fund 1,165   —   1,165   —   Loans 553   —   —   553   Bonds 676   —   676   —   Stocks and other investments 2,783   1,716   2   1,065   Total $ 7,097   $ 3,636   $ 1,843   $ 1,618   20 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) The following table shows the change in fair value of Level 3 plan assets for the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021: Level 3 Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan Assets Loans Stocks Balance at March 25, 2022 $ 553   $ 1,065   Additions during the year 328   —   Redemptions during the year ( 280 ) —   Revaluation of equity securities 4   75   Change in foreign currency exchange rates ( 27 ) ( 52 ) Balance at December 23, 2022 $ 578   $ 1,088   Balance at March 26, 2021 $ 584   $ 1,133   Additions during the year 308   —   Redemptions during the year ( 289 ) —   Revaluation of equity securities ( 5 ) 13   Change in foreign currency exchange rates ( 20 ) ( 34 ) Balance at December 24, 2021 $ 578   $ 1,112   The investments in the Company’s major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within the market sectors. In recent years, the Company’s investment policy has shifted toward a closer matching of the interest-rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Allegro MicroSystems, LLC’s (“AML”), non-U.S. defined benefit plan, has added a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. There are no significant restrictions on the amount or nature of the investments that may be acquired or held by the plans. During the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022, the Company contributed approximately $ 403
and $ 1,102
to its non-U.S. pension plan, respectively. During the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, the Company contributed approximately $ 344
and $ 1,040
to its non-U.S. pension plan, respectively. The Company expects to contribute approximately $ 1,546
to its non-U.S. pension plan in fiscal year 2023. Defined Contribution Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan that covers all employees meeting certain service and age requirements. Employees are eligible to participate in the plan upon hire when the service and age requirements are met. Employees may contribute up to
35 % of their compensation, subject to the maximum contribution allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. All employees are
100 % vested in their contributions at the time of plan entry. Eligible AML U.S. employees may contribute up to
50 % of their pretax compensation to a defined contribution plan, subject to certain limitations, and AML may match, at its discretion,
100 % of the participants’ pretax contributions, up to a maximum of
5 % of their eligible compensation. Matching contributions by AML totaled approximately $ 917
and $ 3,399
for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022, respectively, and approximately $ 665
and $ 3,000
for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, respectively. 14.
Commitments and Contingencies Insurance The Company, through its subsidiaries, utilizes self-insured employee health programs for employees in the United States. The Company records estimated liabilities for its self-insured health programs based on information provided by the third-party plan administrators, historical claims experience and expected costs of claims incurred but not reported. The Company monitors its estimated liabilities on a quarterly basis. As facts change, it may become necessary to make
21 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) adjustments that could be material to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations. Legal proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory examinations or investigations arising in the normal course of business, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company’s ultimate liability, if any, is difficult to predict. The Company records an accrual for legal contingencies when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making such determinations, the Company evaluates, among other things, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss. If the occurrence of liability is probable and estimable, the Company will disclose the nature of the contingency and will provide the likely amount of such loss or range of loss. The Company does not believe there are any current matters that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Indemnification From time to time, the Company has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless certain customers for potential allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights and patents arising from the use of its products. To date, the Company has not recognized or incurred any costs in connection with such indemnification arrangements; therefore, there was
no
accrual of such amounts at December 23, 2022 or March 25, 2022. Environmental Matters The Company establishes accrued liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. If the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual, or the Company’s share of the contingency increases or decreases or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change, the Company would recognize an additional expense or benefit in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during the period such determination was made.
No
significant environmental accruals were established at December 23, 2022 or March 25, 2022. 15.

Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees over the related requisite service period, including performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares (all part of our equity incentive plan). Duri ng the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021, the Company granted RSUs to employees of
2,153,507
and

The total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recorded at December 23, 2022 was $ 22,818 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of
2.86
years. During the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021,
117,096
and
227,530 , respectively, shares of the Company’s restricted common stock vested.
No
shares and
24,014
shares, respectively, were forfeited, which reduced common stock outstanding during the same periods. The Company had

unvested shares of restricted common stock at December 23, 2022 with a weighted average grant date fair value of $ 14.00
and remaining vesting period of

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the following expense categories of its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Cost of sales $ 1,156   $ 742   $ 3,112   $ 1,992   Research and development 3,174   1,019   6,013   2,814   Selling, general and administrative 4,572   5,859   42,117   13,841   Total stock-based compensation $ 8,902   $ 7,620   $ 51,242   $ 18,647   During the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company’s (former) President and Chief Executive Officer, Ravi Vig, provided notice of his retirement from the Company and its board of directors (the “Board”), effective June 13, 2022.
23 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Additionally, the Company entered into a second amended and restated severance agreement (the “Second A&R Severance Agreement”) with Mr. Vig that amended and restated the amended agreement from September 30, 2020. As provided for in the Second A&R Severance Agreement, the Company agreed, in addition to other cash-settled and health insurance-related compensation, to modifications to Mr. Vig’s stock-based compensation, including: (i) acceleration of the vesting of all unvested RSUs; (ii) modification of certain PSUs with performance conditions that had been achieved as of the retirement date to permit these awards to remain outstanding and eligible to vest in accordance with their terms; and (iii) the forfeiture of certain unvested PSUs with performance conditions that had not been achieved as of the retirement date and replacement thereof with new immediately vesting RSUs. The impact of these modifications on stock-based compensation expense was $ 26,349
for the nine-month period ended
December 23, 2022 , which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 17 .
Income Taxes The Company recorded the following tax provision in its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 7,540 $ 6,281 $ 17,943 $ 16,687 Effective tax rate 10.5 % 16.0 % 12.5 % 15.1 % The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of the year-to-date taxes based on an estimate of the annual effective tax rate plus the tax impact of discrete items. The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate can fluctuate primarily based on: the mix of its U.S. and foreign income; the impact of discrete transactions; and the difference between the amount of tax benefit generated by the foreign derived intangible income deduction (“FDII”) and research credits offset by the additional tax from the global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). The effective tax rate (“ETR”) year-over-year was primarily impacted by Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174 Capitalization (“174 Capitalization”), FDII deductions, a reduction in state taxes and an increase in current year non-deductible executive compensation expense. 174 Capitalization increased U.S. taxable income, cash taxes, FDII deductions, and GILTI inclusions. The net tax impact from 174 Capitalization is favorable because the increased FDII deductions of $ 9,300
exceed the additional inclusion for GILTI income inclusions of $ 945
(“Net 174 Benefit”). The Net 174 Benefit, current-year FDII deductions, and state tax benefits are offset in the current year by increased non-deductible executive compensation of $ 6,694 , and discrete tax impacts. The quarter over quarter ETR impact relates primarily to Net 174 benefits. 18.
Related Party Transactions Transactions involving Sanken The Company sells products to, and purchases in-process products from, Sanken. As of December 23, 2022, Sanken held approximately
51.5 % of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Net sales of the Company’s products to Sanken totaled $ 45,117
and $ 131,852
during the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022, respectively, and
$ 39,461
and $ 112,079
during the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, respectively. Trade accounts receivables, net of allowances from Sanken, totaled $ 30,902
and $ 27,256
as of December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, respectively. Other accounts receivable from Sanken totaled $ 168
and $ 104
as of December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, respectively. Termination of Sanken Distribution Agreement On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into a transition agreement with Sanken that provides for the termination of the distribution agreement dated as of July 5, 2007, by and between the Company and Sanken (the “Distribution Agreement”) and sets forth the terms governing the collaboration between the parties to transition the marketing and sale of the Company’s products in Japan from Sanken to the Company during the 12-month transition period beginning on September 29, 2022 (the “Transition Agreement”). Following the 12-month transition period, both the Transition Agreement and the Distribution Agreement will terminate. 24 ALLEGRO MICROSYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued) (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Sanken will cease to place new orders for the Company’s products and will begin to transition existing orders to the Company. All orders are expected to be transferred by June 30, 2023. Sanken also will continue to provide support to the Company’s customers and logistical support to the Company during the transition period. In addition, in the Transition Agreement, the Company and Sanken agreed to enter into a separate agreement regarding the transfer of inventory to the Company and a one-time payment to Sanken based on Sanken’s analysis of its inventory position as of December 23, 2022. The Transition Agreement had no impact on the Company’s results during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Transition Agreement and termination of the Distribution Agreement are expected to transfer related party distributor sales to third party distributors and direct customers, as well as eliminate the distributor discount historically provided to Sanken. Transactions involving Polar Semiconductor, LLC (“PSL”) The Company purchases in-process products from PSL. PSL is a subsidiary of Sanken,
70 % owned by Sanken and
30 % owned by the Company. Purchases of various products from PSL totaled $ 15,995
and $ 45,145
for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022, respectively, and $ 11,837
and $ 38,346
for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, respectively. Accounts payable to PSL included in amounts due to a related party totaled $ 5,659
and $ 5,222
as of December 23, 2022 and March 25, 2022, respectively. Effective January 26, 2023, the Company and PSL entered into a new Wafer Foundry Agreement (“WFA”) for the fabrication of wafers. The WFA replaces the previous Wafer Foundry Agreement with PSL, dated April 12, 2013, which was due to expire on March 31, 2023. The WFA has a
three-year
term, and auto renews for subsequent
one-year
terms, unless terminated by either party’s providing
two years
notice. Pursuant to the WFA, the Company will provide a rolling annual forecast for
three years , the first
two years
of which will be binding. If the Company fails to purchase the forecasted number of wafers for either of the first
two years , it will pay a penalty for any shortfall for the given year. The parties also agreed upon production lead-times, as well as wafer, alignment, and mask pricing for the first
two years
of the term. Any changes to such pricing is subject to mutual agreement. On December 2, 2021, AML entered into a loan agreement with PSL wherein PSL provided an initial promissory note to AML for a principal amount of $ 7,500
(the “Initial PSL Loan”). The Initial PSL Loan will be repaid in equal installments, comprising principal and interest accrued at
1.26 % per annum, over a term of
four years
with payments due on the first day of each calendar year quarter (April 1, July 1, October 1, and January 1). In addition, on July 1, 2022, PSL borrowed an additional $ 7,500
under the same terms of the PSL Loan (the “Secondary PSL Loan” and, together with the Initial PSL Loan, the “PSL Promissory Notes”). The loan funds were used by PSL to procure a deep ultraviolet scanner and other associated manufacturing tools necessary to increase wafer fabrication capacity in support of the Company’s increasing wafer demand. As of December 23, 2022, the outstanding balance of the PSL Promissory Notes was $ 13,125 . During the nine months ended December 23, 2022, PSL made required quarterly payments to AML totaling $ 2,005 , which included $ 130
of interest income. On January 2, 2023, PSL made a quarterly payment to AML of $ 1,009 , which included $ 72
of interest income. 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

During the three- and nine-month periods ended December 24, 2021, we generated $186.6 million and $568.4 million in total net sales, respectively, with $33.0 million and $93.9 million in net income, respectively. Recent Initiatives to Improve Results of Operations We implemented several initiatives during fiscal year 2022 and into fiscal year 2023
that were designed to improve our operating results during those fiscal years and going forward. We continue to implement initiatives to improve gross margins, which is calculated as gross profit divided by total net sales. Our gross margin improved from 54.2% in the third quarter of 2022 to 57.3% in the third quarter of 2023. This gross margin improvement was a result of our improved product mix of higher average selling prices (“ASPs”) on more value-added products, increased leverage of our distribution channel, and continued efficiency and leverage on higher volumes. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our facility to increase production where demand for our products warrants. We have been successful in increasing our ASPs through a focus on feature-rich products and selective price increases. Increased ASPs and manufacturing efficiencies have allowed us to continue to improve gross margin in an environment of limited capacity at our suppliers and rising input costs. Limited supply and increased demand for many of our products and applications, as well as supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation, have contributed to input cost increases on the components needed to manufacture our products. We will continue to consider opportunities for
26 strategic price increases and process efficiencies to offset input cost increases on the materials and supplies that we use in production. With our efforts to leverage our fixed cost and operating margin improvements, we have attained efficiencies through cost structure improvements, streamlining of manufacturing and support processes, and further utilization of excess capacity. These manufacturing efficiencies allowed us to leverage higher volumes with increasing demand across most of our applications, while reducing cost of goods sold and increasing the absorption of fixed costs. Although these initiatives have resulted in gross margin and operating income improvements over the previous quarters, we cannot ensure that these trends will continue over the long-term. In September 2022, we completed the acquisition of Heyday Integrated Circuits (“Heyday”), a privately held company specializing in compact, fully integrated isolated gate drivers that enable energy conversion in high-voltage gallium nitride and silicon carbide wide-bandgap semiconductor designs (the “Heyday Acquisition”). The Heyday Acquisition is expected to complement our existing solutions for energy efficiency, including our market-leading current sensor solutions. Additionally, it is expected to significantly expand Allegro’s addressable market for xEV, solar inverters, data center and 5G power supplies, and broad-market industrial applications.
In September 2022, the Company entered into a transition agreement with Sanken that provides for the termination of the distribution agreement dated as of July 5, 2007, by and between the Company and Sanken (the “Distribution Agreement”) and sets forth the terms governing the collaboration between the parties to transition the marketing and sale of the Company’s products in Japan from Sanken to the Company during the twelve-month transition period beginning on September 29, 2022 (the “Transition Agreement”). The Transition Agreement and termination of the Distribution Agreement are expected to transfer related party distributor sales to third party distributors and direct customers in Japan, as well as eliminate the distributor discount historically provided to Sanken. Additionally, we will invest in expanding our operations in Japan in order to directly manage and service our customers in that market, which is expected to result in increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses. The net impacts of the transition from the existing sales model in Japan is expected to provide incremental benefits to our gross margin over the long-term. Other Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Operating Results Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by numerous other factors and trends, including the following: Inflation Inflation rates in the markets in which we operate have increased and may continue to rise. Inflation over the last several months has led us to experience higher costs, including higher labor costs, wafer and other costs for materials from suppliers, and transportation costs. Our suppliers have raised their prices and may continue to raise prices, and in the competitive markets in which we operate, we may not be able to make corresponding price increases to preserve our gross margins and profitability. If inflation rates continue to rise or remain elevated for a sustained period of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and l iquidity. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Design Wins with New and Existing Customers Our end customers continually develop new products in existing and new application areas, and we work closely with our significant OEM customers in most of our target markets to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. For new products, the time from design initiation and manufacturing until we generate sales can be lengthy, typically between two and four years. As a result, our future sales are highly dependent on our continued success at winning design mandates from our customers. Further, despite current inflationary and pricing conditions, we expect the ASPs of our products to decline over time, and we consider design wins to be critical to our future success. We anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products. The selection process is typically lengthy and may require us to incur significant design and development expenditures in pursuit of a design win, with no assurance that our solutions will be selected. As a result, the loss of any key design win or any significant delay in the ramp-up of volume production of the customer’s products into which our product is designed could adversely affect our business. In addition, volume production is contingent upon the successful introduction and market acceptance of our customers’ end products, which may be affected by many factors that are beyond our control. 27 Customer Demand, Orders and Forecasts Demand for our products is highly dependent on market conditions in the end markets in which our customers operate, which are generally subject to seasonality, cyclicality and competitive conditions. In addition, a substantial portion of our total net sales is derived from sales to customers that purchase large volumes of our products. These customers generally provide periodic forecasts of their requirements, but these forecasts do not commit such customers to minimum purchases, and customers can revise these forecasts without penalty. In addition, as is customary in the semiconductor industry, customers are generally permitted to cancel orders for our products within a specified period. While historically we have permitted order cancellations for most customers, most of our current customer order backlog is noncancellable, which helps mitigate our exposure to unforeseen order cancellations. However, cancellations of orders could still result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses. In addition, changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from customers exposes us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. We continue to see demand for our products exceed supply, and we are currently operating in an inflationary environment. Manufacturing Costs and Product Mix Gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including the ASPs of our products, product mix in a given period, material costs, yields, manufacturing costs and efficiencies. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the ASP negotiated between us and our customers relative to material costs and yields. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the products we produce and sell to our customers. As our products mature and unit volumes increase, despite current price leverage, we expect their ASPs to decline in the long term. We continually monitor and work to reduce the cost of our products and improve the potential value our solutions provide to our customers as we target new design win opportunities and manage the product life cycles of our existing customer designs. We also maintain a close relationship with our suppliers and subcontractors to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. As a result, these declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly, and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from declining ASPs. However, we expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to product mix, new product introductions, transitions into volume manufacturing and manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally decreases if production volumes are lower as a result of decreased demand, which leads to a reduced absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally increases when the opposite occurs. Cyclical Nature of the Semiconductor Industry The semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological change, product obsolescence, competitive pricing pressures, evolving standards, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. New technology may result in sudden changes in system designs or platform changes that may render some of our products obsolete and require us to devote significant research and development resources to compete effectively. Periods of rapid growth and capacity
expansion are occasionally followed by significant market corrections in which sales decline, inventories accumulate, and facilities go underutilized. During periods of expansion, our margins generally improve as fixed costs are spread over higher manufacturing volumes and unit sales. In addition, we may build inventory to meet increasing market demand for our products during these times, which serves to absorb fixed costs further and increase our gross margins. During an expansion cycle, we may increase capital spending and hiring to add to our production capacity. During periods of slower growth or industry contractions, our sales, production and productivity suffer, and margins generally decline. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Jobs Act”), beginning in fiscal year 2023, U.S. tax law now requires us to capitalize and amortize domestic and foreign research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively (“174 Capitalization”). While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify, or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, we have no assurance that this provision will be reversed. If no new legislation is passed and made effective retroactively, we estimate the impact of the Jobs Act will increase our annual cash taxes by $23.0 million and produce an increased FDII effective tax rate benefit. The actual impact of 174 Capitalization on cash taxes and the effective tax rate depends on if Congress passes additional legislation, whether such legislation is made retroactively, the amount of the research and development expenditures incurred by the Company during the fiscal year, and upon additional guidance the Internal Revenue Service may issue related to this provision. 28 Results of Operations Three-Month Period Ended December 23, 2022 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended December 24, 2021 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021.

Sales Trends by Geographic Location The following table summarizes net sales by geographic location based on ship-to location. Three-Month Period Ended Change December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Amount % (Dollars in thousands) Americas: United States $ 33,613  $ 26,228  $ 7,385  28.2  % Other Americas 6,473  4,921  1,552  31.5  % EMEA: Europe 39,650  29,891  9,759  32.6  % Asia: Greater China 64,305  48,696  15,609  32.1  % Japan 45,117  39,461  5,656  14.3  % South Korea 25,504  19,935  5,569  27.9  % Other Asia 34,127  17,497  16,630  95.0  % Total net sales $ 248,789  $ 186,629  $ 62,160  33.3  % Net sales increased across all international locations in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the three-month period ended December 24, 2021, primarily due to content and market share gains across all geographies. Other Asia and South Korea experienced sales growth of $16.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively, primarily due to higher demand for our data center, internal combustion engine (“ICE”), safety, comfort and convenience, ADAS, xEV, consumer appliances and computing offerings. The increase in net sales of $15.6 million, or 32.1%, in Greater China related to higher automotive demand, primarily in our ADAS, safety, comfort and convenience and xEV sectors. The increase in net sales of $9.8 million, or 32.6%, in Europe, predominantly comprised of Germany and France, was primarily driven by increases in Industry 4.0, ADAS, xEV and broad-based industrial demand. The increase in net sales in the United States of $7.4 million, or 28.2%, was primarily driven by increased demand in both the automotive and industrial sectors. Net sales in Japan grew $5.7 million, or 14.3%, which was primarily driven by higher demand in our xEV and Industry 4.0 offerings. Other Americas increased $1.6 million, or 31.5%, primarily due to higher automotive demand, specifically in our ADAS and safety, comfort and convenience applications. 31 Cost of goods sold and gross profit Cost of goods sol d increased by $20.7 million, or 24.3%, to $106.2 million in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $85.5 million in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to higher production volume in support of higher product sales. Gross profit increased by $41.4 million, or 41.0%, to $142.6 million in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $101.2 million in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. The increase in gross profit was driven by a $62.2 million increase in net sales across all markets, partially offset by the impacts to cost of goods sold discussed above. R&D expenses R&D expen ses increased by $9.3 million, or 30.7%, to $39.6 million in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $30.3 million in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a combined $5.5 million increase in personnel and outside service costs, higher stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, and a $1.4 million increase in general operating expenses. R&D expenses represented 15.9% of our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, a decrease from 16.2% of our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. This percentage decrease was primarily due to the growth in net sales in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022. SG&A expenses SG&A expenses
decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 1.6%, to $37.4 million in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, from $38.0 million in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to lower combined general operating expenses and professional fees of $5.7 million and lower stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in combined personnel costs, supplies, maintenance and travel costs of $6.6 million. SG&A expenses represented 15.0% of our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, a decrease from 20.3% of our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. This percentage decrease was primarily due to the growth in net sales in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net was $0.3 million for each of the three-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021. For the three-month period ended December 23, 2022, higher mandatory interest payments on the Term Loan Facility were partially offset by higher interest income received from a related party and investments, compared to the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) We recorded a foreign currency transaction gain of $0.4 million in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to an insignificant amount of foreign currency transaction loss in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. The foreign currency transaction gains recorded in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 were primarily due to the unrealized gains on equity securities denominated in Euros, partially offset by losses from our United Kingdom and Philippines locations. Income in earnings of equity investment Income in earnings of equity investment reflected gains of $2.2 million and $0.3 million in the three-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021, respectively, representing the earnings on our 30% investment in Polar Semiconductor, LLC (“PSL”). Other, net Other, net increased by $0.5 million to $4.1 million of miscellaneous gains in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $3.6 million of miscellaneous gains in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. This increase was largely attributable to unrealized gains on investments recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Income tax provision Income tax provision and the effective income tax rate were $7.5 million and 10.5%, in the three-month period ended December 23, 2022 and $6.3 million and 16.0%, in the three-month period ended December 24, 2021. The effective tax rate
32 (“ETR”) was primarily impacted by 174 Capitalization, FDII deductions, a reduction in state taxes and an increase in current year non-deductible executive compensation expense. 174 Capitalization increased U.S. taxable income, cash taxes, FDII deductions, and GILTI inclusions. The net tax impact from 174 Capitalization is favorable because the increased FDII deductions of $9.3 million exceed the additional inclusion for GILTI income inclusions of $0.9 million (“Net 174 Benefit”). The Net 174 Benefit, current year FDII deductions, and state tax benefits are offset in the current fiscal year by increased non-deductible executive compensation of $6.7 million, and discrete tax impacts.

Automotive net sales increased in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021, as we continued to experience higher demand for our ADAS, xEV, safety, comfort and convenience and ICE applications. 34 Industrial net sales increased in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021, primarily due to increases in demand for our data center, personal mobility and grid infrastructure applications. Other net sales increased in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021, primarily due to increases in demand for certain computer products. Sales Trends by Product The following table summarizes net sales by product. Nine-Month Period Ended Change December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Amount % (Dollars in thousands) MS and other 431,708  373,327  58,381  15.6  % PIC $ 272,500  $ 195,054  $ 77,446  39.7  % Total net sales $ 704,208  $ 568,381  $ 135,827  23.9  % The growth in net sales by product was driven by increases of $77.4 million in PIC product sales and $58.4 million in MS and other product sales during the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the same period last year. Sales Trends by Geographic Location The following table summarizes net sales by geographic location based on ship-to location. Nine-Month Period Ended Change December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 Amount % (Dollars in thousands) Americas: United States $ 87,135  $ 80,854  $ 6,281  7.8  % Other Americas 20,204  16,697  3,507  21.0  % EMEA: Europe 115,693  97,108  18,585  19.1  % Asia: Greater China 182,624  142,158  40,466  28.5  % Japan 131,852  112,079  19,773  17.6  % South Korea 67,414  61,614  5,800  9.4  % Other Asia 99,286  57,871  41,415  71.6  % Total net sales $ 704,208  $ 568,381  $ 135,827  23.9  % The increase in net sales across all geographic locations in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021 was primarily due to content and market share gains. Other Asia experienced sales growth of $41.4 million, or 71.6%, primarily due to higher demand for our data center, computing, ICE, ADAS, and safety, comfort and convenience applications. The increase in net sales of $40.5 million, or 28.5%, in Greater China related to higher automotive demand, primarily in our ADAS, safety, comfort and convenience and xEV sectors. Net sales in Japan grew $19.8 million, or 17.6%, which was primarily driven by higher demand in our personal mobility, xEV, ICE, safety, comfort and convenience and data center applications. The increase in net sales of $18.6 million, or 19.1%, in Europe, predominantly comprised of Germany and France, was primarily driven by increases in automotive and industrial demand. The increase in net sales in the United States of $6.3 million, or 7.8%, was primarily driven by higher demand in our ADAS, household appliances and safety, comfort and convenience offerings. Net sales in South Korea grew $5.8 million, or 9.4%, which was primarily due to higher automotive demand, specifically in our safety, comfort and convenience, xEV, and ADAS applications. Other Americas increased $3.5 million, or 21.0%, primarily due to higher automotive demand, specifically in our ADAS and safety, comfort and convenience applications. 35 Cost of goods sold and gross profit Cost of goods sold increased by $40.7 million, or 15.0%, to $311.2 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $270.5 million in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to higher production volume in support of higher product sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and, to a lesser extent, higher warranty costs incurred. Gross profit increased by $95.1 million, or 31.9%, to $393.0 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $297.9 million in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. The increase in gross profit was driven by a $135.8 million increase in total net sales to all end markets discussed above, partially offset by the impacts to cost of goods sold discussed above. R&D expenses R&D ex pens es increased by $19.6 million, or 21.9%, to $109.0 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $89.4 million in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a combined $14.6 million increase in employee salaries, contract labor, and inventory and supplies costs, a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a combined $1.9 million increase in other general operating expenses. R &D expenses represent ed 15.5% of our total net sales for the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, a decrease from 15.7% of our total net sales in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. This percentage decrease was primarily due to the growth in net sales in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022. SG&A expenses SG&A expenses increased by $42.4 million, or 40.7%, to $146.5 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $104.1 million in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $28.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, including accelerated expense from the retirement of our former chief executive officer of approximately $26.3 million, and a combined $14.1 million increase in employee salaries, severance and insurance costs, partially offset by $0.8 million in combined general operating expenses. SG&A expenses represented 20.8% of our total net sales in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, an increase from 18.3% of our total net sales in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. This percentage increase was primarily due to the impacts noted above, partially offset by growth in net sales in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net was $0.4 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to $1.8 million in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to lower mandatory interest payments on the Term Loan Facility coupled with higher interest income received from investments and a related party in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) Foreign currency transaction gains increased by $2.7 million to $2.6 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 compared to $0.1 million in foreign currency transaction losses in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. The foreign currency transaction gain recorded in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our United Kingdom location, partially offset by realized and unrealized losses from our Philippines location. Income in earnings of equity investment Income in earnings of equity investment reflected gains of $0.3 million and gains of $0.8 million in the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021, respectively, representing the earnings on our 30% investment in PSL. Other, net Other, net decreased by $4.4 million to $0.8 million of miscellaneous gains in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 from $5.2 million of miscellaneous gains in the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. This change was largely attributable to an insignificant amount of unrealized losses on equity securities recognized during the first
36 nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to $4.5 million in unrealized gains on equity securities recognized during the same period last year. Income tax provision Income tax provision and the effective income tax rate were $17.9 million and 12.5% for the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022 and $16.7 million and 15.1% for the nine-month period ended December 24, 2021. The ETR year-over-year was primarily impacted by 174 Capitalization, FDII deductions, a reduction in state taxes and an increase in current year non-deductible executive compensation expense. 174 Capitalization increased U.S. taxable income, cash taxes, FDII deductions, and GILTI inclusions. The net tax impact from 174 Capitalization is favorable because the increased FDII deductions of $9.3 million exceed the additional inclusion for GILTI income inclusions of $0.9 million. The Net 174 Benefit, current year FDII deductions, and state tax benefits are offset in the current fiscal year by increased non-deductible executive compensation of $6.7 million, state tax benefits and discrete tax impacts. Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 23, 2022,
we had $334.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $482.7 million of working capital compared to $282.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $407.5 million of
working capital as of March 25, 2022. Working capital is impacted by the timing and extent of our business needs. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt and other general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. Our current capital deployment strategy for 2023 is to invest excess cash on hand to support our continued growth initiatives into select markets, planned capital expenditures and strategic arrangements, as well as consider potential acquisitions. As of
December 23, 2022 , the Company is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. The cash requirements for the upcoming fiscal year relate to our operating leases, operating and capital purchase commitments and expected contributions to our defined benefit and contribution plans. Additionally, we expect to invest in expanding our operations in Japan in order to directly manage and service our customers in that market, which could result in increases in our total net sales, cost of goods sold and operating expenses. For information regarding the Company’s expected cash requirements and timing of payments related to leases and noncancellable purchase commitments, see Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Company’s 2022 Annual Report. Additionally, refer to Note 16, “Retirement Plans” to the Company’s 2022 Annual Report for more information related to the Company’s pension and defined contribution plans. We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, planned capital expenditures and the additional expenses that we expect to incur during the next 12 months. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through equity or debt financing. We believe that our current operating structure will facilitate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our expected long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next 12 months. If these resources are not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to changes in circumstances, we may be required to seek additional financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may contain covenants that significantly restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future. Any additional financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or our existing stockholders, or at all. 37 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine-month periods ended December 23, 2022 and December 24, 2021: Nine-Month Period Ended December 23, 2022 December 24, 2021 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 145,658  $ 118,558  Net cash used in investing activities (69,291) (50,123) Net cash used in financing activities (16,694) (6,209) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5,344) 604  Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 54,329  $ 62,830  Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $145.7 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, resulting primarily from net income of $125.5 million and noncash charges of $59.0 million, including a one-time charge of approximately $26.3 million related to the acceleration of stock-based compensation expense from the retirement of our former chief executive officer, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from an increase in net operating assets of $38.8 million. The net increase in operating assets consisted of a $39.1 million increase in inventories, a $17.8 million increase in prepaid expenses, a $5.9 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in net amounts due from related parties, partially offset by a $19.6 million increase in trade accounts payable, a $5.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities, and a $2.0 million decrease in other receivables. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of inventory builds to support anticipated sales growth for the remainder of fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets were mostly due to higher long-term deposits and the timing of tax payments, including value-added taxes receivable, insurance and contract costs. The increase in trade accounts receivable, net was primarily due to higher sales volumes and the timing of receipts from customers. The decrease in net amounts due to related parties was primarily due to variations in the timing of such payments in the ordinary course of business. Accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors, partially offset by higher operating purchases, including unpaid capital expenditures of $2.5 million. The increase in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities was primarily the result of higher warranty costs, accrued personnel costs, income taxes, and accrued operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the balance due on the acquisition of Voxtel, Inc. (“Voxtel”). The decrease in other receivables was primarily due to the timing of receipts from Sanken. Net cash provided by operating activities was $118.6 million in the nine months ended December 24, 2021, resulting primarily from our net income of $93.9 million and noncash charges of $50.0 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from an increase in net operating assets of $25.4 million. The net increase in net operating assets consisted of a $11.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $9.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities, a $6.1 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net, and a $2.8 million increase in net amounts due from related parties, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in inventories and a $2.0 million increase in trade accounts payable. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets were primarily due to an increase in prepaid contracts and deposits and the timing of tax payments, including value-added taxes receivable, insurance and contract costs. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities was primarily due to the release of deposits related to the sale of our Thailand-based facility (“AMTC Facility”) and reduction of the balance due on the Voxtel acquisition, partially offset by higher accrued personnel costs, particularly for management incentive bonuses, and higher income taxes due. The increase in trade accounts receivable, net was primarily a result of increased sales year-over-year, as well as the timing of receipts from customers. The increase in net amounts due from related parties was primarily due to variations in the timing of such payments in the ordinary course of business. The decrease in inventories was primarily a result of the continued drawdown after building inventory up in prior periods to support anticipated sales growth and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accounts payable increased primarily due to higher operating purchases, including unpaid capital expenditures of $4.9 million, partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors and suppliers. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $69.3 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $49.6 million and payments related to the acquisition of Heyday of $19.7 million. 38 Net cash used in investing activities was $50.1 million in the nine months ended December 24, 2021, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $55.8 million, payments related to the acquisition of Voxtel of $12.5 million, and purchases of marketable securities of $9.2 million, partially offset by $27.4 million of cash received for the sale of the AMTC Facility. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million in the nine-month period ended December 23, 2022, consisting of taxes related to the net settlement of equity awards and additional funds loaned to PSL under our related party loan agreement, partially offset by proceeds received in connection with the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and proceeds received related to the quarterly payments from PSL on our related party loan. Net cash used in financing activities was $6.2 million in the nine months ended December 24, 2021, consisting of funds loaned to PSL of $7.5 million, partially offset by $1.3 million of proceeds received in connection with the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Debt Obligations See
Note 11, “Debt and Other Borrowings”
in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
for information regarding our debt obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since March 25, 2022. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in our exposures to market risk since March 25, 2022. For details on the Company’s interest rate, foreign currency exchange, and inflation risks, see “Part I, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risks” in our 2022 Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 23, 2022. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 23, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 39 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
40 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in claims, regulatory examinations or investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, and the Company’s ultimate liability, if any, is inherently uncertain. We are not currently party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. of our Annual Report, as amended and updated by Part II, Item 1A. of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 24, 2022. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. Effective January 26, 2023, the Company and PSL entered into a new Wafer Foundry Agreement (“WFA”) for the fabrication of wafers. The WFA replaces the previous Wafer Foundry Agreement with PSL, dated April 12, 2013, which was due to expire on March 31, 2023. The WFA has a three-year term, and auto renews for subsequent one-year terms, unless terminated by either party’s providing two years notice. Pursuant to the WFA, the Company will provide a rolling annual forecast for three years, the first two years of which will be binding. If the Company fails to purchase the forecasted number of wafers for either of the first two years, it will pay a penalty for any shortfall for the given year. The parties also agreed upon production lead-times, as well as wafer, alignment, and mask pricing for the first two years of the term. Any changes to such pricing is subject to mutual agreement.
See Note 18, “Related Party Transactions” in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a description of the relationship between the Company and PSL.
