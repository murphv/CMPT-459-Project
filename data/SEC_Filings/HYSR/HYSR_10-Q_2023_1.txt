NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED
DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
1. Basis
of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the six months ended December
31, 2022. For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2022.
2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This summary of significant accounting
policies of SunHydrogen, Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements
and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting
policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the
preparation of the financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalent
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentration risk
Cash includes amounts deposited in
financial institutions in excess of insurable Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) limits. At times throughout the year, the Company
may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of the FDIC limits. As of December 31, 2022, the cash balance in excess
of the FDIC limits was $ 19,291,669 . The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk in these accounts.
Marketable Securities
The Company considers corporate bonds
(“bonds”) as investments due to their ratings. The bonds are rated based on their default probability, health of the corporation’s
debt structure, as well as the overall health of the economy. The bonds fall into the category as investments if they have a rating of
AAA and BBB.
Corporate bonds and U.S.
Treasuries are considered current, based on their liquidity. The investments are generally valued using quoted prices and are
classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as prices are not always from active markets. We consider our investments held to
maturity and we believe there are no other than temporary declines in fair value. Our investments are recorded at historical
cost.
Use of Estimates
In accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well
as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These
estimates and assumptions relate to useful lives and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, accruals, income taxes, stock-based
compensation expense, Binomial lattice valuation model inputs, derivative liabilities and other factors. Management believes it has exercised
reasonable judgment in deriving these estimates. Consequently, a change in conditions could affect these estimates.
Property
and Equipment
Property and
equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using straight line over its estimated useful lives.
Computers and peripheral equipment

Company recognized depreciation expense of $ 17,923

Intangible Assets
The Company has patent applications
to protect the inventions and processes behind its proprietary bio-based back-sheet, a protective covering for the back of photovoltaic
solar modules traditionally made from petroleum-based film. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over
their useful lives.

Net Earnings (Loss) per
Share Calculations
Net earnings (Loss) per share dictates
the calculation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings (loss) per share is computed similar
to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the effect of stock options and stock-based awards
(Note 4), plus the assumed conversion of convertible debt (Note 5).
Six Months Ended December 30,
2022
The Company calculated the dilutive impact of
154,894,499
outstanding
stock options,
94,895,239
common stock purchase warrants, and the convertible debt and accrued interest of $ 948,623 , which is convertible
into shares of common stock. The warrants and convertible debt were included because their impact is dilutive.
Six Months Ended December 31,
2021
The Company calculated the dilutive impact of
157,965,711
outstanding
stock options,
94,895,239
common stock purchase warrants, and the convertible debt and accrued interest of $ 1,173,384 , which is convertible
into shares of common stock. The common stock purchase warrants were included in the calculation of net earnings per share, because their
impact on income per share is dilutive.

2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Equity Incentive Plan and Stock
Options
On January 27, 2022, the Company adopted the 2022 Equity Incentive
Plan, to enable the Company to attract and retain the types of employees, consultants, and directors who will contribute to the Company’s
long-range success.
The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2022
Plan is initially
400,000,000 . The number of shares will automatically be increased on the first day of the Company’s fiscal
year beginning in 2023 so that the total number of shares issuable will at all times equal fifteen percent ( 15 %) of the Company’s
fully diluted capitalization on the first day of the Company’s fiscal year, unless the Board adopts a resolution providing
that the number of shares issuable under the 2022 Plan shall not be so increased.
Equity Incentive Plan
On December 17, 2018, the Board of
Directors approved and adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“the Plan”), with
300,000,000
shares reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success of the Company and to increase stockholder value by providing
an additional means through the grant of awards to attract, motivate, retain and reward selected employees and other eligible persons.
The awards are performance-based compensation that are granted under the Plan as incentive stock options (ISO) or nonqualified stock options.
The per share exercise price for each option shall not be less than
100 % of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date
of grant of the option. The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising
transactions for services and for financing cost. The Company accounts for stock option grants issued and vesting to employees and non-employees
in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date
at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally
are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements
by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested, and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of
the measurement date. The Company granted options to purchase
170,000,000
shares of common stock options on January 23, 2019.
As
of December 31, 2022, there were  154,894,499  stock options issued, and a reserve of  46,741,308 .
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock option
grants issued and vesting to employees and non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance
commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based
compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are
no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested, and the total stock-based compensation charge
is recorded in the period of the measurement date.
Warrant Accounting
The Company accounts for the warrants
to purchase shares of common stock using the estimated fair value on the date of issuance as calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation
model.
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
Fair value of financial instruments
requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate
that value. As of December 31, 2022, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and other expenses, notes payables, convertible notes,
and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.
We adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial
instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair
value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
● Level
1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
● Level
2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.
● Level
3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions,
such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
We
measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis are as follows on December 31, 2022 (See Note 6):
Total
(Level 1)
(Level 2)

Gain on change in derivative liability
( 941,837 )
Balance as of December 31, 2022

The derivative liability balance consisted
of the derivative liabilities for convertible notes in the amount of $ 22,578,380
and warrants in the amount of $ 2,494,852
for an aggregate
total of $ 25,073,232 .
Research and Development
Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred.  Total research and development costs were $ 2,080,320
and $ 437,215
for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.
Accounting for Derivatives
The Company evaluates all of its financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses a probability weighted average series Binomial lattice formula pricing models to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates.
The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the
derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

STOCK
Series C Preferred Stock
On December 15, 2021, the Company filed a certificate of designation
of Series C Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Nevada, designating
17,000
shares of preferred stock as Series C Preferred
Stock. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock has a stated value of $ 100
and is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company
at a conversion price equal to $ 0.00095 . The Series C Preferred Stockholders are entitled to receive out of any funds and assets of the
Company legally available prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the common stock of the Company, cumulative
dividends, at an annual rate of
10 % of the stated value, payable in cash or shares of common stock. In the event the Company declares
or pays a dividend on its shares of common stock (other than dividend payable in shares of common stock), the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock will also be entitled to receive payment of such dividend on an as-if-converted basis. The Series C Preferred Stock confers no voting
rights on holders, except with respect to matters that materially and adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the
Series C Preferred Stock or as otherwise required by applicable law.
The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement on December
15, 2021, with an accredited investor for an exchange of convertible debt to equity.
Under the purchase agreement, the Company and investor
acknowledged there was $187,800 of principal remaining under the note issued to the investor by the Company on February 3, 2017, plus
$80,365 of accrued interest, representing a total aggregate note balance of $268,165. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company
sold to the investor 2,700 shares of the Company’s newly designated Series C Preferred Stock for a total purchase price of $268,165,
and a loss on settlement of debt of $1,835. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total of 2,700 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
outstanding with a fair value of $268,165, and a stated face value of one hundred dollars ($100) (“share value’) per share,
convertible into shares of common stock of the Company. The stock was presented as mezzanine equity because it is redeemable at a fixed
or determinable amount upon an event that is outside of the issuer’s control. Upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the
Company, the holder of each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Company
available for distribution to its shareholders upon such liquidation, before any payments shall be made or any assets distributed to the
holders of the common stock, the stated value of the Series C Preferred Shares plus any declared but unpaid dividends. No other current
or future equity holders of the Company shall have higher priority of liquidation preference than holders of Series C Preferred Stock.
The holder has the right, at any time, at its election, to convert shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock at a conversion
price of $0.00095.
Common Stock
On January 27, 2022, the holder of
the majority of the voting power of the shareholders of the Company, and the Company’s chief executive officer, approved by written
consent (i) an amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized shares of common
stock from
5,000,000,000
to
10,000,000,000 , (ii) an amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation to effect a reverse stock
split of the Company’s common stock by a ratio of not less than 1-for-100 and not more than 1-for-500 at any time prior to the one
year anniversary of filing the definitive information statement with respect to the reverse split, with the board of directors having
the discretion as to whether or not the reverse split is to be effected, and with the exact ratio of any reverse split to be set at a
whole number within the above range as determined by the board in its discretion, and (iii) the adoption of the Company’s 2022 Equity
Incentive Plan. Such shareholder approval for such actions became effective 20 days after the definitive information statement relating
to such actions was mailed to shareholders.

to convertible debt issued by the Company in instances where the number into which the debt can be converted is not fixed. For example,
when a convertible debt converts at a discount to market based on the stock price on the date of conversion, ASC Topic 815 requires that
the embedded conversion option of the convertible debt be bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at their fair value. In accounting
for derivatives under accounting standards, the Company recorded a liability representing the estimated present value of the conversion
feature considering the historic volatility of the Company’s stock, and a discount representing the imputed interest associated
with the embedded derivative. The discount is amortized over the life of the convertible debt, and the derivative liability is adjusted
periodically according to stock price fluctuations.
The convertible notes issued do not
have fixed settlement provisions because their conversion prices are not fixed. The conversion features have been characterized as derivative
liabilities to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.
During the period ended December 31,
2022, the Company recorded a net gain in change in derivative of $ 941,837
in the statement of operations due to the change in fair value
of the remaining notes, for the period ended December 31, 2022.

SunHydrogen, Inc.
Overview
At  SunHydrogen, our
goal is to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable hydrogen.
Hydrogen is the most abundant
chemical element in the universe. When hydrogen fuel is used to power transportation and industry, the only byproduct left behind is pure
water, unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas that emit carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.
However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is rare – so rare, in fact, that today about 95% of hydrogen is produced from steam
reforming of natural gas (Source: US Department of Energy,  Hydrogen Fuel Basics).  This process is both economically and
environmentally unsound.
The SunHydrogen solution offers
an efficient and cost-effective way to produce truly green hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water. Our core technology is a self-contained,
nanoparticle-based hydrogen generator that mimics photosynthesis to split water molecules, resulting in hydrogen. By optimizing the science
of water electrolysis at the nano-level, we believe we have developed a low-cost method to potentially produce environmentally friendly
renewable hydrogen.
We believe renewable hydrogen
has already proven itself to be a key solution in helping the world meet climate targets, and we believe our technology potentially offers
solutions to the challenges that the hydrogen future presents, including cost of production and transportation.
Because our process only requires
sunlight and water, our technology can be installed near the point of hydrogen use. This eliminates the need for pipelines and trucks
that result in high carbon emissions and high capital investment. Additionally, because our process directly uses the electrical charges
created by sunlight to generate hydrogen, our nanoparticle technology does not rely on grid power or require the costly power electronics
that conventional electrolyzers do. Lastly, our planned scalable system configuration of many individual hydrogen-generating panels ensures
redundancy, security and stability.
With a target cost of $2.50/kg.,
we aspire for our technology to be cost-competitive with brown hydrogen and below the cost of clean hydrogen competitors. We believe our
solution has the potential to clear a path for green hydrogen to compete with natural gas hydrogen and gain mass market acceptance as
a true replacement for fossil fuels.
Our technology is primarily
developed at three laboratories – our independent laboratory in Coralville, Iowa, the SunHydrogen laboratory at the University of
Iowa, and the Singh laboratory at University of Michigan.
17
Additionally, in parallel
to the ongoing development of our own technology, we are well-capitalized to begin pursuing synergistic strategic investments in the hydrogen
space. SunHydrogen is committed to furthering renewable hydrogen technology to grow the hydrogen ecosystem, and we are actively pursuing
opportunities for investment and acquisition of complimentary hydrogen technologies. We are fortunate to have the resources to maximize
our impact in this fast-growing industry.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to impairment of property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value computation using the Binomial valuation option pricing model.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, such as the trading value of our common stock and estimated
future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described
items, are reasonable.
Use of Estimates
In accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates
and assumptions relate to useful lives and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, accruals, income taxes, stock-based compensation
expense, Binomial lattice valuation model inputs, derivative liabilities and other factors. Management believes it has exercised reasonable
judgment in deriving these estimates. Consequently, a change in conditions could affect these estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value of financial instruments
requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate
that value. As of December 31, 2022, the amounts reported for cash, investment in affiliate, accrued interest and other expenses, notes
payables, and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.
We adopted ASC Topic 820 for
financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Management reviewed currently
issued pronouncements during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements. Pronouncements
are disclosed in notes to the financial statements.

Results of Operations for the Three Months
Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 were $5,061,951 compared to $737,611 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The net increase
of $4,324,340 in operating expenses consisted primarily of an increase in salaries and research and development.
Other Income/(Expenses)
Other income and (expenses)
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $9,659,897 compared to $25,169,373 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The
decrease in other expenses of $15,509,476 was the result of a decrease in gain on change in derivative liability.
Net Income/(Loss)
For the three months ended
December 31, 2022, our net income was $4,597,946, compared to net income of $24,431,762 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The majority of the decrease in net income of $19,833,816, was related primarily to the decrease in net change of derivative instruments
estimated each period. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock
price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain
outcomes based on managements’ estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the
estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. The Company
has not generated any revenues.
Results of Operations for the Six months ended December 31, 2022
compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 were $5,700,654, compared to $1,337,377 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The net increase
of $4,363,277 in operating expenses consisted primarily of an increase in salaries and research and development.
Other Income/(Expenses)
Other income and (expenses)
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $9,401,649, compared to $74,393,983 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
in other expenses of $64,992,334 was the result of a decrease in the fair value change in derivative liability.
Net Income/(Loss)
For the six months ended December
31, 2022, our net income was $3,700,995, compared to net income of $73,056,606 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The majority
of the decrease in net income of $69,355,611 was related primarily to the decrease in net change of derivative instruments estimated each
period. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility,
variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on
managements’ estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value
of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. The Company has not generated
any revenues.
19
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of
a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing
basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts
payable and capital expenditures.
As of December 31, 2022, we
had working capital of $29,475,135, compared to $24,865,577 as of June 30, 2022. This increase in working capital of $4, 609,558 was primarily
due to an increase in cash.
Cash used in operating
activities was $2,706,929 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,301,469 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in cash used in operating activities was due to an increase in salaries. The Company has had no revenues.
Cash used in investing activities
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $6,555,114 and $8,653,392, respectively. The decrease of $2,098,278
in investing activities was due to the redemption of the securities and the purchase of assets.
Cash provided by financing
activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $1,401,209, compared to cash used in financing activities of $(1,450,000)
for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to cash received for the purchase
of common stock through a purchase agreement.
Our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon raising capital through financing transactions and future revenue. Our capital needs have primarily
been met from the proceeds of private placements and registered offerings of our securities, as we have not generated any revenues to
date.
We have historically obtained
funding from investors, through private placements and registered offerings of equity and debt securities. Management believes that the
Company will be able to continue to raise funds through the sale of its securities to its existing shareholders and prospective new investors,
which will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due and will allow the Company to
continue to develop its core business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue raising the required capital for our
operations on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be forced
to curtail and/or cease our operation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, result
of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.
Not required for smaller reporting
companies.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period
covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).
Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is:
(i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or person performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
There was no change to our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
