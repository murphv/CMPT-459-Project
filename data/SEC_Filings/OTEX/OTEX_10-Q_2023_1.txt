The information furnished reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. In particular, key estimates, judgments and assumptions include those related to: (i) revenue recognition, (ii) accounting for income taxes, (iii) testing of goodwill for impairment, (iv) the valuation of acquired intangible assets, (v) the valuation of long-lived assets, (vi) the recognition of contingencies, (vii) restructuring accruals, (viii) acquisition accruals and pre-acquisition contingencies, (ix) the valuation of stock options granted and obligations related to share-based payments, including the valuation of our long-term incentive plans, (x) the valuation of pension obligations, and (xi) the valuation of derivative instruments.
10 Table of Contents Acquisition of Micro Focus On August 25, 2022, we announced an agreement on the terms of an all-cash offer (through our wholly-owned subsidiary), to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus International PLC (Micro Focus), for a total purchase price of approximately $ 5.8
billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and debt, subject to final adjustments. Concurrent with the announcement of the acquisition of Micro Focus (Micro Focus Acquisition), the Company entered into the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan (each as defined below) as well as certain derivative transactions. These derivative transactions were marked-to-market during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, with the resulting unrealized gains (losses) on these derivatives recognized in Other Income (Expense) within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 1, 2022, the Company issued and sold $ 1.0
billion in aggregate principal amount of
6.90 % Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027) and amended the Acquisition Term Loan to increase commitments to an aggregate principal amount of $ 3.585
billion. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and increase in the Acquisition Term Loan, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to
zero
and the Bridge Loan was terminated.
On January 31, 2023, we completed the Micro Focus Acquisition and repaid Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $ 450.0  million
under the Revolver (as defined below). We used proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and cash on hand to fund the remaining purchase price consideration. The deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” entered into to hedge certain foreign currency obligations in relation to the Micro Focus Acquisition, are expected to be settled on February 9, 2023.
The following Notes include details related to the Micro Focus Acquisition: Note 9 “Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets,” Note 10 “Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities,” Note 11 “Long-Term Debt,” Note 16 “Fair Value Measurement,” Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” Note 19 “Acquisitions”, Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net,” and Note 25 “Subsequent Events.” NOTE 2— RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2023 During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, there have been no new Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) or changes in accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact to our reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows . 11 Table of Contents NOTE 3— REVENUES Disaggregation of Revenue We have
four
revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license, and professional service and other.
The following tables disaggregate our revenue by significant geographic area, based on the location of our direct end customer, by type of performance obligation and timing of revenue recognition for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas

(2) EMEA primarily consists of countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. (3) Asia Pacific primarily consists of Japan, Australia, China, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, India and New Zealand. (4) Recurring revenue is defined as the sum of Cloud services and subscriptions revenue and Customer support revenue. Contract Balances A contract asset, net of allowance for credit losses, will be recorded if we have recognized revenue but do not have an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. For example, this will be the case if implementation services offered in a cloud arrangement are identified as a separate performance obligation and are provided to a customer prior to us being able to bill the customer. In addition, a contract asset may arise in relation to subscription licenses if the license revenue that is recognized upfront exceeds the amount that we are able to invoice the customer at that time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional. The balance for our contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e. deferred revenues) for the periods indicated below were as follows: As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 Short-term contract assets
$ 25,613   $ 26,167   Long-term contract assets
$ 18,603   $ 19,719   Short-term deferred revenues $ 879,226   $ 902,202   Long-term deferred revenues $ 84,681   $ 91,144   The difference in the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from the timing difference between our performance and the customer’s payments. We fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. During the six months ended
12 Table of Contents December 31, 2022, we reclassified $ 20.2
million (six months ended December 31, 2021 — $ 18.3
million) of contract assets to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, there was
no
significant impairment loss recognized related to contract assets. We recognize deferred revenue when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer for future obligations to transfer products or services. Our deferred revenues primarily relate to cloud services and customer support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. The amount of revenue that was recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in the deferred revenue balances at June 30, 2022 was $ 658
million (six months ended December 31, 2021—$ 630
million). Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract with a Customer Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that we incur to obtain a contract that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions.
The following table summarizes the changes in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract, since June 30, 2022: Capitalized costs to obtain a contract as of June 30, 2022 $ 82,562   New capitalized costs incurred 16,425   Amortization of capitalized costs ( 15,571 ) Impact of foreign exchange rate changes 123   Capitalized costs to obtain a contract as of December 31, 2022 $ 83,539   During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, there was
no
significant impairment loss recognized related to capitalized costs to obtain a contract. Refer to Note 9 “Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets” for additional information on incremental costs of obtaining a contract. Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 1.6
billion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations on existing contracts. We expect to recognize approximately
46 % of this amount over the next
12
months and the remaining balance substantially over the next
three years
thereafter. We apply the practical expedient and do not disclose performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.
NOTE 4— ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The following illustrates the activity in our allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable, since June 30, 2022: Balance as of June 30, 2022 $ 16,473   Credit loss expense (recovery) 940   Write-off / adjustments ( 324 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 17,089   Included in accounts receivable are unbilled receivables in the amount of $ 61.4
million as of December 31, 2022 (June 30, 2022—$ 47.9
million). As of December 31, 2022, we have an allowance for credit losses of $ 0.5
million for contract assets (June 30, 2022—$ 0.7
million).

3.875 % Senior Notes due 2028 (Senior Notes 2028) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Notes 2028 bear interest at a rate of
3.875 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2020. Senior Notes 2028 will mature on February 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded interest expense of $ 8.7
million and $ 17.4
million, respectively, relating to Senior Notes 2028 (three and six months ended December 31, 2021—$ 8.7
million and $ 17.4
million, respectively). Senior Notes 2026 On May 31, 2016, we issued $ 600
million in aggregate principal amount of
5.875 % Senior Notes due 2026 (Senior Notes 2026) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Notes 2026 had interest at a rate of
5.875 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 1, 2016. Senior Notes 2026 would have matured on June 1, 2026. On December 20, 2016, we issued an additional $ 250
million in aggregate principal amount by reopening our Senior Notes 2026 at an issue price of
102.75 %. The additional notes had identical terms, were fungible with and were part of a single series with the previously issued $ 600
million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026, after taking into consideration the additional issuance, was $ 850
million as of December 9, 2021. On December 9, 2021, we redeemed Senior Notes 2026 in full at a price equal to
102.9375 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. A portion of the net proceeds from the offerings of Senior Notes 2029 and Senior Notes 2031 was used to redeem Senior Notes 2026. Upon redemption, Senior Notes 2026 were cancelled and any obligation thereunder was extinguished. The resulting loss of $ 27.4
million, consisting of $ 25.0
million relating to the early termination call premium, $ 6.2
million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs and $( 3.8 ) million relating to unamortized premium, has been recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net.” For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did
not
record any interest expense relating to Senior Notes 2026 (three and six months ended December 31, 2021—$ 9.4
million and $ 21.9
million, respectively). Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes Senior Secured Notes 2027 On December 1, 2022, we issued $ 1  billion in aggregate principal amount of
6.90 % Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027 and, together with the Senior Notes 2031, Senior Notes 2030, Senior Notes 2029 and Senior Notes 2028, the Senior Notes) in connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Secured Notes 2027 bear interest at a rate of
6.90 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2023. Senior Secured Notes 2027 will mature on December 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed (which would have occurred in accordance with the terms of the indenture, had we not completed the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 25 “Subsequent Events”)), in accordance with their terms, or repurchased. The Senior Secured Notes 2027 are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, and are secured with the same priority as the Company’s senior credit facilities. The Senior Secured Notes 2027 and the related guarantees are effectively senior to all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured debt to the extent of the value of
20 Table of Contents the collateral (as defined in the indenture to the Senior Secured Notes 2027) and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes 2027. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded interest expense of $ 5.8
million, relating to Senior Secured Notes 2027 (three and six months ended December 31, 2021— nil ). Term Loan B On May 30, 2018, we refinanced our existing term loan facility, by entering into a new $ 1
billion term loan facility (Term Loan B), whereby we borrowed $ 1
billion on that day and repaid in full the loans under our prior $ 800
million term loan facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Borrowings under Term Loan B are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the Revolver (as defined below), Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below) and Senior Secured Notes 2027. Term Loan B has a
seven-year
term, maturing in May 2025, and repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to
0.25 % of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under Term Loan B currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to
1.75 % plus LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan B bears an interest rate of
5.82 %. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see “Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against” included within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Under Term Loan B, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than
4 :1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was
2.0 :1. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded interest expense of $ 13.2
million and $ 22.9
million, respectively, relating to Term Loan B (three and six months ended December 31, 2021—$ 4.5
million and $ 9.1
million, respectively). Revolver On October 31, 2019, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from $ 450
million to $ 750
million as well as to extend the maturity from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B, the Acquisition Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes 2027. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from
1.25 % to
1.75 %. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see “Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against” included within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had
no
outstanding balance under the Revolver (June 30, 2022— nil ). For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did
not
record any interest expense relating to the Revolver (three and six months ended December 31, 2021— nil ). On January 27, 2023, the Company drew down $ 450.0  million from the Revolver to finance the Micro Focus Acquisition. Acquisition Term Loan On December 1, 2022, we amended our first lien term loan facility (the Acquisition Term Loan), dated as of August 25, 2022, to increase the aggregate commitments under the senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility from an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.585
billion to an aggregate principal amount of $ 3.585
billion. On January 31, 2023, the Company drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, of which the net proceeds were used to finance the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 19
—
“Acquisitions” for more details). The Acquisition Term Loan has a
seven-year
term from the date of funding, and repayments under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to
0.25 % of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of the Acquisition Term Loan, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan will bear interest at rates as specified in the Acquisition Term Loan. The Acquisition Term Loan has incremental facility capacity of (i) $ 250
million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding
2.75 :1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced
21 Table of Contents by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by the Company’s or any of the Company’s subsidiaries’ assets, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under the Acquisition Term Loan, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than
4.5 :1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was
2.0 :1. The Acquisition Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan, and is secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver, Term Loan B and the Senior Secured Notes 2027. As of December 31, 2022, we had
no
borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did
not
record any interest expense relating to the Acquisition Term Loan (three and six months ended December 31, 2021— nil , respectively).
Bridge Loan On August 25, 2022, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (Bridge Loan) which provided for commitments of up to $ 2.0
billion to finance a portion of the repayment of Micro Focus’ existing debt. On December 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Bridge Loan that reallocated commitments under the Bridge Loan to the Acquisition Term Loan. In connection with the amendment to the Bridge Loan and the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to
zero
and the Bridge Loan was terminated, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 8.1
million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs (see Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net” for more details) .
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did
not
have any borrowings or record any interest expense relating to the Bridge Loan (three and six months ended December 31, 2021— nil , respectively).
Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs relate primarily to costs incurred for the purpose of obtaining our credit facilities and issuing our Senior Notes and are being amortized through interest expense over the respective terms of the Senior Notes, Term Loan B, and Acquisition Term Loan using the effective interest method and straight line method for the Revolver. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had
$ 54.9
million
in deferred debt issuance costs included in “Other Assets” (see Note 9 “Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets” for more details). NOTE 12— PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Defined Benefit Plans CDT Plan CDT sponsors an unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all CDT employees (CDT plan) which provides for old age, disability and survivors’ benefits. Benefits under the CDT plan are generally based on age at retirement, years of service and the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of this pension plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and estimated service costs.
No
contributions have been made since the inception of the plan.
GXS GER Plan As part of our acquisition of GXS Group, Inc. (GXS) in Fiscal 2014, we assumed an unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering certain German employees which provides for old age, disability and survivors' benefits. The GXS GER plan has been closed to new participants since 2006. Benefits under the GXS GER plan are generally based on a participant’s remuneration, date of hire, years of eligible service and age at retirement. The net periodic cost of this pension plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and estimated service costs.
No
contributions have been made since the inception of the plan. GXS PHP Plan As part of our acquisition of GXS in Fiscal 2014, we assumed a primarily unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of the GXS Philippines employees which provides for retirement, disability and survivors' benefits. Benefits
22 Table of Contents under the GXS PHP plan are generally based on a participant’s remuneration, years of eligible service and age at retirement. The net periodic cost of this pension plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and estimated service costs. Aside from an initial contribution which has a fair value of $( 0.03 ) million as of December 31, 2022,
no

We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or, where appropriate, the Monte Carlo pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The option-pricing models require input of subjective assumptions, including the estimated life of the option and the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the estimated life of the option. We use historical volatility as a basis for projecting the expected volatility of the underlying stock and estimate the expected life of our stock options based upon historical data. We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of our stock option grants. Estimates of fair value are not intended, however, to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards. For the periods indicated, the weighted-average fair value of options and weighted-average assumptions estimated under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Weighted–average fair value of options granted $ 5.77   $ 9.73   $ 6.40   $ 9.74   Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 28.87   % 26.66   % 28.50   % 26.63   % Risk–free interest rate 4.46   % 0.90   % 4.03   % 0.64   % Expected dividend yield 3.46   % 1.63   % 3.16   % 1.58   % Expected life (in years) 4.20 4.13 4.19 4.15 Forfeiture rate (based on historical rates) 7   % 7   % 7   % 7   % Average exercise share price $ 26.81   $ 51.61   $ 30.07   $ 52.35   25 Table of Contents Performance Options During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we granted
zero
and
1,000,000
performance options, respectively (during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021— nil , respectively). For the period in which performance options were granted, the weighted-average fair value of performance options and weighted-average assumptions estimated under the Monte Carlo pricing model were as follows:   Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 Weighted–average fair value of options granted $ 8.09   Derived service period (in years) 1.7 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 26.00   % Risk–free interest rate 3.21   % Expected dividend yield 2.00   % Average exercise share price $ 31.89   Long-Term Incentive Plans We incentivize certain eligible employees, in part, with long-term compensation pursuant to our LTIP. The LTIP is a rolling
three-year
program that grants eligible employees a certain number of target Performance Share Units (PSUs) and/or Restricted Share Units (RSUs). Target PSUs become vested upon the achievement of certain financial and/or operational performance criteria (the Performance Conditions) that are determined at the time of the grant. RSUs become vested when an eligible employee remains employed throughout the vesting period. PSUs and RSUs granted under the LTIP have been measured at fair value as of the effective date, consistent with Topic 718, and will be charged to share-based compensation expense over the remaining life of the plan. We estimate the fair value of PSUs using the Monte Carlo pricing model and RSUs have been valued based upon their grant date fair value. Stock options granted under the LTIP have been measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with Topic 718.
LTIP 2025 Grants made in Fiscal 2023 under the LTIP (collectively referred to as LTIP 2025), consisting of PSUs and RSUs, took effect in Fiscal 2023 starting on August 8, 2022. The Performance Conditions for vesting of the PSUs are based solely upon market conditions. The RSUs are employee service-based awards and vest over the life of the LTIP 2025. We expect to settle the LTIP 2025 awards in Common Shares. The LTIP 2025 PSU and RSU awards are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units that vest under the same conditions as the underlying grants.

(2) For contractual obligations relating to leases and purchase obligations accounted for under ASC Topic 842, please see Note 6 “Leases.” Guarantees and Indemnifications We have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third-party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Occasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Litigation
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As
28 Table of Contents described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters. Contingencies CRA Matter As part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of December 31, 2022, in connection with the CRA's reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $ 72
million. As of December 31, 2022, we have provisionally paid approximately $ 32  million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA's audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within “Long-term income taxes recoverable” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $ 90
million to $ 100
million for each of those years, as well as impose a
10 % penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability. We strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing. Even if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above. The CRA has audited Fiscal 2017 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. On January 27, 2022, the CRA issued a notice of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of assets in Canada. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $ 470  million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute. We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is currently in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019. Carbonite Class Action Complaint
On August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer,
29 Table of Contents Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite’s Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the “Securities Actions”). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. The motion was fully briefed in June 2020 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss the Securities Actions was held on October 15, 2020. Following the hearing, on October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants’ motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit, and will continue to vigorously defend the matter. Carbonite vs Realtime Data
On February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas “Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL).” Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite’s cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data’s complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. NOTE 15— INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was
16.4 %, compared to a provision of
30.8 % for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was
37.3 %, compared to a provision of
27.3 % for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, differs from the Canadian statutory rate of
26.5 % primarily due to the pre-tax gain created by the mark-to-market valuation on the derivatives not designated as hedges that the Company entered into in connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”). The mark-to-market gains in the quarter are considered capital income for tax purposes and enabled us to recognize the capital losses in the prior quarter that were previously unrecognized.
Other items impacting the rate include provision to return adjustments, a net increase in uncertain tax positions, and permanent items such as disallowed stock-based compensation and foreign passive income inclusion, partially offset by research and development credits and amending a prior year return to reduce the prior year US Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory rate primarily due to US BEAT, partially offset by research and development credits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, differs from the Canadian statutory rate of
26.5 % primarily due to a net increase in uncertain tax positions and permanent items such as disallowed stock-based
30 Table of Contents compensation and foreign passive income inclusion, partially offset by research and development credits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory rate primarily due to US BEAT, partially offset by research and development credits.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits accrued is $ 66.6
million, which is inclusive of interest and penalties accrued of $ 9.1
million (June 30, 2022 — $ 54.1
million and $ 8.4
million, respectively). We believe that it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefit could decrease by $ 6.5
million in the next 12 months, relating primarily to the expiration of competent authority relief and tax years becoming statute barred for purposes of future tax examinations by local taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax audits in all major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, and remain subject to income tax audits by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those tax filings relate. We currently have income tax audits open in Canada, the United States, Germany and other immaterial jurisdictions. The earliest fiscal years open for examination for our major jurisdictions are 2012 for Canada, 2016 for the United States and 2016 for Germany. On a quarterly basis we assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes. Statements regarding the Canada audits are included in Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies.” The timing of the resolution of income tax audits is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax audits in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. For more information relating to certain income tax audits, please refer to Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies.” As of December 31, 2022, we have recognized a provision of $ 21.8
million (June 30, 2022—$ 19.9
million) in respect of both additional foreign taxes or deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution. We have not provided for additional foreign withholding taxes or deferred income tax liabilities related to undistributed earnings of all other non-Canadian subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered permanently invested in those subsidiaries or are not subject to withholding taxes. It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amount of additional deferred income tax liabilities or foreign withholding taxes that may be payable should these earnings be distributed in the future. NOTE 16— FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” (Topic 820) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and addresses disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value, in this context, should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own credit risk. In addition to defining fair value and addressing disclosure requirements, Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:   • Level 1—inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. • Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3—inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 31 Table of Contents Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following types of instruments as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: Fair Value Fair Value Hierarchy December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Financial Assets (Liabilities): Designated as Hedging Instruments Cash flow hedge (Note 17)

Deal-contingent foreign currency forward contract Balance as of June 30, 2022 $ —   Gain (loss) recognized in income 285   Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 285   Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our Level 2 and Level 3 derivative instruments, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from pricing models including discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data, as no quoted market prices exist for these instruments. Our discounted cash flow techniques use observable market inputs, such as, where applicable, foreign currency spot and forward rates. The valuation technique for our Level 3 derivative instrument utilizes management estimates related to the probability and timing of our Micro Focus Acquisition that are unobservable, and are not deemed to be significant inputs for the overall valuation.
Our cash and cash equivalents, along with our accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances, are measured and recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at an amount that approximates the fair value (a Level 2 measurement) due to their short maturities.
The fair value of our Senior Notes is determined based on observable market prices and categorized as a Level 2 measurement. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value was $ 3.7
billion (June 30, 2022—$ 2.8
billion). The carrying value of our other long-term debt facilities approximates the fair value since the interest rate is at market. Please see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” for further details. If applicable, we will recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we did not have any transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, no indications of impairments were identified and therefore no fair value measurements were required.
32 Table of Contents NOTE 17— DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Cash Flow Hedge We are engaged in hedging programs with various banks to limit the potential foreign exchange fluctuations incurred on future cash flows relating to a portion of our Canadian dollar payroll expenses. We operate internationally and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, in particular to changes in the Canadian dollar on account of large costs that are incurred from our centralized Canadian operations, which are denominated in Canadian dollars. As part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge portions of our payroll exposure with typical maturities of between
one
and
twelve months . We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes. We have designated these transactions as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions under ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” (Topic 815). As the critical terms of the hedging instrument and of the entire hedged forecasted transaction are the same, in accordance with Topic 815, we have been able to conclude that changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to completely offset at inception and on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, quarterly unrealized gains or losses on the effective portion of these forward contracts have been included within “Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) - net.” As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contracts is recorded within “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and represents the net loss before tax effect that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings with the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2022, the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. dollars in exchange for Canadian dollars was $ 87.6
million (June 30, 2022—$ 66.5
million). Non-designated Hedges In connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, in August 2022, the Company entered into certain derivative transactions to meet certain foreign currency obligations under UK cash confirmation requirements related to the purchase price of the Micro Focus Acquisition, mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the GBP denominated purchase price and mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the EUR denominated existing debt held by Micro Focus. The Company entered into the following derivatives: (i)
three
deal-contingent forward contracts, (ii) a non-contingent forward contract, and (iii) EUR/USD cross currency swaps. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of £ 1.475
billion. The non-contingent forward contract has a notional amount of £ 350
million. The cross currency swaps are comprised of a
5
year EUR/USD cross currency swap with a notional amount of € 690
million and a
7
year EUR/USD cross currency swap with a notional amount of € 690
million. The deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” entered into to hedge certain foreign currency obligations in relation to the Micro Focus Acquisition, are expected to be settled on February 9, 2023.
These instruments were entered into as economic hedges to mitigate foreign currency risks associated with the Micro Focus Acquisition. The instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting at inception. Derivative financial instruments that do not apply hedge accounting are recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, the forward contracts are in a net asset position and are classified within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and the cross currency swaps are in a net liability position and are classified within “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.” The forward contracts and cross currency swaps are measured at fair value with changes to fair value being recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income within “Other income (expense), net.”

The Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Plan charges will relate to facility costs and workforce reductions. Facility costs will include the accelerated amortization associated with the abandonment of ROU assets, the write-off of fixed assets and other related variable lease and exit costs. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized costs of $ 0.5  million and $ 4.3
million respectively related to abandoned office space that have been early terminated or assigned to a third party, of which $ 1  million and $ 3.9
million were related to the write-off of right of use assets. As of December 31, 2022, we expect total costs to be incurred in connection with the Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Plan to be approximately $ 35.0  million to $ 40.0  million, of which $ 33.9  million has been recorded within “Special charges (recoveries)” to date. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included within “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”

For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, “Other charges” includes $ 2.0

35 Table of Contents NOTE 19— ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions Acquisition of Micro Focus On August 25, 2022, we announced an agreement on the terms of an all-cash offer (through our wholly-owned subsidiary), to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus International PLC (Micro Focus), for a total purchase price of approximately $ 5.8
billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and debt, subject to final adjustments.
Concurrent with the announcement of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the Company entered into the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan (see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt”) as well as certain derivative transactions (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”). These derivative transactions were marked-to-market during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, with the resulting unrealized gains (losses) on these derivatives recognized in Other Income (Expense) within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net”). On October 18, 2022, the shareholders of Micro Focus approved the all-cash offer. On December 1, 2022, the Company issued and sold $ 1  billion in aggregate principal amount of
6.90 % Senior Secured Notes 2027 and amended the Acquisition Term Loan to increase commitments to an aggregate principal amount of $ 3.585
billion. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and increase in the Acquisition Term Loan, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to
zero
and the Bridge Loan was terminated.
On January 31, 2023, we completed the Micro Focus Acquisition and repaid Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $ 450.0  million under the Revolver. We used proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and cash on hand to fund the remaining purchase price consideration. The deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” entered into to hedge certain foreign currency obligations in relation to the Micro Focus Acquisition, are expected to be settled on February 9, 2023.
Acquisition-related costs for Micro Focus included in “Special Charges (Recoveries)” in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were $ 5.9
million and $ 10.3
million. Fiscal 2022 Acquisitions Acquisition of Zix Corporation On December 23, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Zix, a leader in software as a service (SaaS) based email encryption, threat protection and compliance cloud solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). Total consideration for Zix was $ 894.5
million paid in cash, inclusive of cash acquired and $ 18.6
million relating to the cash settlement of pre-acquisition vested share-based compensation that was previously accrued but since paid as of March 31, 2022. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805 “Business Combinations” (Topic 805), this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. We believe the acquisition increases our position in the data protection, threat management, email security and compliance solutions spaces. The results of operations of Zix have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 23, 2021. 36 Table of Contents Purchase Price Allocation The recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of December 23, 2021, are set forth below: Current assets (inclusive of cash acquired of $ 38.3
million) $ 71,527   Non-current tangible assets 13,450   Intangible customer assets 212,400   Intangible technology assets 92,650   Liabilities assumed ( 81,476 ) Total identifiable net assets 308,551   Goodwill 585,910   Net assets acquired $ 894,461   The goodwill of $ 585.9
million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. There is $ 103.7
million of goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of current assets acquired includes accounts receivable with a fair value of $ 26.0
million. The gross amount receivable was $ 32.6
million, of which $ 6.6
million is expected to be uncollectible. Acquisition-related costs for Zix included in “Special Charges (Recoveries)” in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were
nil
and $ 0.2
million, respectively. Pre-acquisition equity incentives of $ 26.4  million were replaced upon acquisition by equivalent value cash settlements to be settled in accordance with the original vesting dates, primarily over the
two years
after the date of the acquisition. Of these equity incentives, $ 3.6
million and $ 7.2
million, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were included in “Special Charges (Recoveries).”
The finalization of the purchase price allocation during the three months ended December 31, 2022 did not result in any significant changes to the preliminary amounts previously disclosed. Acquisition of Bricata Inc. On November 24, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bricata Inc. (Bricata) for $ 17.8
million. In accordance with Topic 805, this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. We believe the acquisition strengthens our OpenText Security and Protection Cloud with Network Detection and Response technologies. The results of operations of Bricata have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning November 24, 2021.

million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and $( 3.8 ) million related to unamortized premium (see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” for more details). NOTE 23— EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to OpenText, by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method.

NOTE 24— RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our procedure regarding the approval of any related party transaction requires that the material facts of such transaction be reviewed by the independent members of the Audit Committee and the transaction be approved by a majority of the independent members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews all transactions in which we are, or will be, a participant and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee generally takes into account, among other facts it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances; the extent and nature of the related person’s interest in the transaction; the benefits to the Company of the proposed transaction; if applicable, the effects on a director’s independence; and if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable services or products. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Stephen Sadler, a member of the Board of Directors, earned
$ 7
thousand
(six months ended December 31, 2021 — $ 0.4
million) in consulting fees from OpenText for assistance with acquisition-related business activities. Mr. Sadler abstained from voting on all transactions from which he would potentially derive consulting fees. 39 Table of Contents NOTE 25— SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Cash Dividends As part of our quarterly, non-cumulative cash dividend program, we declared, on February 1, 2023, a dividend of $ 0.24299
per Common Share. The record date for this dividend is March 3, 2023 and the payment date is March 23, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination and discretion of our Board. Acquisition of Micro Focus On August 25, 2022, we announced an agreement on the terms of an all-cash offer (through our wholly-owned subsidiary), to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus International PLC (Micro Focus), for a total purchase price of approximately $ 5.8
billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and debt, subject to final adjustments. On January 31, 2023, we completed the Micro Focus Acquisition and repaid Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $ 450.0  million under the Revolver. We used proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and cash on hand to fund the remaining purchase price consideration. The deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” entered into to hedge certain foreign currency obligations in relation to the Micro Focus Acquisition, are expected to be settled on February 9, 2023.
In accordance with Topic 805, the Micro Focus Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. The major classes of assets acquired through the Micro Focus Acquisition include, current assets, non-current tangible assets, intangible technology assets and intangible customer assets, as well as certain liabilities assumed. Due to the limited time since the acquisition date and the size and complexity of the transaction, the accounting for the business combination is not yet complete. The Company is not able to provide the allocation of consideration paid to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. As such, it is impractical for the Company to present pro forma and comparative statements as of the date of this filing and such statements will be included in a subsequent Form 8-K. The results of operations of Micro Focus will be consolidated with those of OpenText beginning in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023.

Quarterly Summary: During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 we saw the following activity: • Total revenue was $897.4 million, up 2.4% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; up 7.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $47.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes.
• Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as the sum of cloud services and subscriptions revenue and customer support revenue, was $725.2 million, up 3.6% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; up 8.7% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $35.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes. • Cloud services and subscriptions revenue was $408.7 million, up 12.0% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; up 16.0% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $14.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes. • GAAP-based gross margin was 70.8% compared to 70.2% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. • Non-GAAP-based gross margin was 76.0% compared to 76.4% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. 43 Table of Contents • GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $258.5 million compared to $88.3 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to $171.6 million unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as hedges.
• Non-GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $240.2 million compared to $242.1 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. • GAAP-based earnings per share (EPS), diluted, was $0.96 compared to $0.32 in the same period in the prior fiscal year. • Non-GAAP-based EPS, diluted, remained flat at $0.89 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. • Adjusted EBITDA was $340.9 million compared to $343.5 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. • Operating cash flow was $327.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $406.3 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year, down 19.5%. • Cash and cash equivalents were $2,820.9 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $1,693.7 million as of June 30, 2022.

See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions and reconciliations of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures. See “Acquisitions” below for the impact of acquisitions on the period-to-period comparability of results. Acquisitions As a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Acquisition of Micro Focus On August 25, 2022, we announced an agreement on the terms of an all-cash offer (through our wholly-owned subsidiary), to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus International PLC (Micro Focus), for a total purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and debt, subject to final adjustments.
Concurrent with the announcement of the acquisition of Micro Focus (Micro Focus Acquisition), the Company entered into the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan (see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt”) as well as certain derivative transactions (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”). These derivative transactions were marked-to-market during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, with the resulting unrealized gains (losses) on these derivatives recognized in Other Income (Expense) within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 1, 2022, the Company issued and sold $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.90% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 and amended the Acquisition Term Loan to increase commitments to an aggregate principal amount of $3.585 billion. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and increase in the Acquisition Term Loan, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to zero and the Bridge Loan was terminated.
On January 31, 2023, we completed the Micro Focus Acquisition and repaid Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $450.0 million under the Revolver. We used proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 and cash on hand to fund the remaining purchase price consideration. The deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” entered into to hedge certain foreign currency obligations in relation to the Micro Focus Acquisition, are expected to be settled on February 9, 2023.
44 Table of Contents Acquisition of Zix Corporation On December 23, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Zix Corporation (Zix), a leader in software as a service (SaaS) based email encryption, threat protection and compliance cloud solutions for SMBs. Total consideration for Zix was $894.5 million paid in cash, inclusive of $38.3 million of cash acquired and $18.6 million relating to the cash settlement of pre-acquisition vested share-based compensation. We believe the acquisition increases our position in the data protection, threat management, email security and compliance solutions spaces. The results of operations of Zix have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 23, 2021. See Note 19 “Acquisitions” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Impacts of COVID-19
We continue to closely monitor the potential effects and impact of the spread of COVID-19 on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage. We have conducted business with modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of certain events, along with modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. In addition, we have implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control. For more information, please see Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Impacts of Russia-Ukraine Conflict We have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. While we do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Outlook for Remainder of Fiscal 2023 As an organization, we are committed to “Total Growth,” meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which will help us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe our Total Growth strategy is a durable model that will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability. We are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in research and development (R&D) push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base and new customers, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world's largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we have invested $219.9 million or 12.6% of revenue in R&D expense, which is in line with our target spend for R&D expense this fiscal year. As a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we will target to spend 13% to 15% of revenues for R&D expense for the remainder of this fiscal year. Looking ahead, the destination for innovation is hybrid-cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud and programs to help customers off-cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and
45 Table of Contents performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. The OpenText Cloud is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything, and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services. On January 31, 2023, we completed the Micro Focus Acquisition. The Micro Focus Acquisition will substantially expand our scope and size by adding substantial assets and operations to our existing business. We have incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional integration costs following the close of the Micro Focus Acquisition. On January 31, 2023, the Company announced a restructuring plan that will impact its global workforce following the Micro Focus Acquisition in an effort to further streamline our operations, consistent with previously announced cost synergies of $400 million (Fiscal 2023 Restructuring Plan). The total size of the plan is expected to result in a reduction in the combined workforce of approximately 8% or 2,000 employees with an estimated cost of $70 to $80 million. The Fiscal 2023 Restructuring Plan is proposed to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2023. See also Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will continue to closely monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19, inflation with respect to wages, services and goods, concerns regarding any potential recession, rising interest rates, financial market volatility, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business. We do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: (i) Revenue recognition,
(ii) Goodwill,
(iii) Acquired intangibles, and (iv) Income taxes. For a full discussion of all our accounting policies, please see Note 2 “Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables provide a detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. For each of the periods indicated below, we present our revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type, and their corresponding percentage of total revenue.
In addition, we provide Non-GAAP measures for the periods discussed to provide additional information to investors that we believe will be useful as this presentation aligns with how our management assesses our Company's performance. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures. 46 Table of Contents Summary of Results of Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 Change

Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type 1)    Cloud Services and Subscriptions: Cloud services and subscriptions revenues are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as platform as a service (PaaS), SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, our cloud renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite Inc. (Carbonite) and Zix, increased to 94% from 93% over the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs, and some third party royalty costs.

The increase was primarily driven by incremental Cloud services and subscriptions revenues from acquisitions over the comparative period. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $43.1 million and an increase in EMEA of $2.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in Asia Pacific of $2.3 million. There were 23 cloud services contracts greater than $1.0 million that closed during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, compared to 27 contracts during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $12.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This was due to an increase in third-party network usage fees of $7.9 million and an increase in labour-related costs of $3.9 million primarily driven by incremental Cloud services and subscriptions cost of revenues from acquisitions over the comparative period. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues remained stable at 67%. 48 Table of Contents Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $91.9 million or 12.7% during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; up 16.4% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $26.6 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The increase was primarily driven by incremental Cloud services and subscriptions revenues from acquisitions over the comparative period. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $83.4 million, an increase in EMEA of $11.7 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $3.3 million. There were 41 cloud services contracts greater than $1.0 million that closed during the first six months of Fiscal 2023, compared to 43 contracts during the first six months of Fiscal 2022. Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $24.2 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This was due to an increase in third-party network usage fees of $15.9 million, an increase in labour-related costs of $7.0 million and an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $1.2 million primarily driven by incremental Cloud services and subscriptions cost of revenues from acquisitions over the comparative period. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues remained stable at 67%. 2)    Customer Support: Customer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements. These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, our Customer support renewal rate increased to 95% compared to 94% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Cost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third party royalty costs.

Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are included within the “Professional service and other” category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.
Cost of Professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third-party subcontracting.

The Company’s tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5% primarily due to the pre-tax gain created by the mark-to-market valuation on the derivatives not designated as hedges that the Company entered into in connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”). The mark-to-market gains in the quarter are considered capital income for tax purposes and enabled us to recognize the capital losses in the prior quarter that were previously unrecognized.
Other items impacting the rate include provision to return adjustments, a net increase in uncertain tax positions, and permanent items such as disallowed stock-based compensation and foreign passive income inclusion, partially offset by research and development credits and amending a prior year return to reduce the prior year US Base Erosion and Anti- 56 Table of Contents Abuse Tax (BEAT). The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory rate primarily due to US BEAT, partially offset by research and development credits. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 37.3% compared to a provision of 27.3% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5% primarily due to a net increase in uncertain tax positions and permanent items such as disallowed stock-based compensation and foreign passive income inclusion, partially offset by research and development credits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory rate primarily due to US BEAT, partially offset by research and development credits. Additionally, the provision from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development costs is effective starting Fiscal 2023. If not deferred, modified or repealed, this provision may materially increase future cash taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act were signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The corporate minimum tax will be effective for Fiscal 2024. We are currently evaluating the applicability and the effect of the new law to our financial results. For information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the CRA matter, see Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. 57 Table of Contents Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results.
The Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below. Non-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income or earnings (loss) per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries). The Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term “non-operational charge” is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company’s “Special charges (recoveries)” caption on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
In summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results. The following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of U.S. GAAP-based financial measures to Non-GAAP-based financial measures for the following periods presented. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures

Other income (expense) also includes unrealized gains (losses) on our derivatives which are not designated as hedges, that are related to the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition. We exclude gains and losses on these derivatives as we do not believe they are reflective on our ongoing business and operating results.
(7) Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 16% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and “book to return” adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period.

(4) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 “Special Charges (Recoveries)” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (5) GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars. (6) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results. (7) Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 27% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based adjusted net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves, and “book to return” adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense. 65 Table of Contents (8) Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income: Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Per share diluted GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText $ 220,213  $ 0.81  Add: Amortization 210,318  0.77  Share-based compensation 28,343  0.10  Special charges (recoveries) 9,561  0.04  Other (income) expense, net (4,745) (0.02) GAAP-based provision for income taxes 82,716  0.30  Non-GAAP-based provision for income taxes (76,509) (0.28) Non-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText $ 469,897  $ 1.72  Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText $ 220,213  Add: Provision for income taxes 82,716  Interest and other related expense, net 77,300  Amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets 105,769  Amortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets 104,549  Depreciation 43,165  Share-based compensation 28,343  Special charges (recoveries) 9,561  Other (income) expense, net (4,745) Adjusted EBITDA $ 666,871  66 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following tables set forth changes in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:

We continue to anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, as well as available credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, contractual commitments, capital expenditures, dividends, operating needs and pending acquisitions for the next twelve months. Any further material or acquisition-related activities may require additional sources of financing and would be subject to the financial covenants established under our credit facilities. For more details, see “Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities” below.
As of December 31, 2022, we have recognized a provision of $21.8 million (June 30, 2022—$19.9 million) in respect of both additional foreign taxes or deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution. Cash flows provided by operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities decreased by $79.2 million, due to a decrease in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $105 million, partially offset by an increase in changes from working capital of $25.7 million. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 our days sales outstanding (DSO) of 47 days, compared to our DSO of 44 days during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. The per day impact of our DSO in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 on our cash flows was $10.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. Cash flows used in investing activities Our cash flows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $826.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of Zix Corporation for $837.6 million and purchase of Bricata Inc. for $17.9 million during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. Cash flows provided by financing activities
Our cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) purchases by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares.
Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $449.7 million. This is primarily due to a net increase of $378.7 million in cash proceeds from the issuance and redemption of long-term debt, inclusive of debt issuance costs and debt
67 Table of Contents extinguishment costs, during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 as compared to the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, and a decrease of $110.7 million related to the repurchase of common shares and treasury stock, partially offset by reduced proceeds of $29.9 million related to the issuance of common shares and increased dividend payments of $10.0 million.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.24299 and $0.48598 per Common Share, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $64.9 million and $129.6 million, respectively (three and six months ended December 31, 2021—$0.2209 and $0.4418 per Common Share, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $59.7 million and $119.5 million, respectively). Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board.

Term Loan B On May 30, 2018, we entered into a credit facility, which provides for a $1 billion term loan facility with certain lenders named therein, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as sole administrative agent and collateral agent, and as lead arranger and joint bookrunner (Term Loan B) and borrowed the full amount on May 30, 2018 to, among other things, repay in full the loans under our prior $800 million term loan credit facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under Term Loan B are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the Revolver, the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan. Term Loan B has a seven-year term, maturing in May 2025. Borrowings under Term Loan B bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower’s option, either (1) the Eurodollar rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or (2) an ABR rate. The applicable margin for borrowings under Term Loan B is 1.75%, with respect to LIBOR advances and 0.75%, with respect to ABR advances. The interest on the current outstanding balance for Term Loan B is equal to 1.75% plus LIBOR (subject to a 0.00% floor). As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 5.82%. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see “Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against” included within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Term Loan B has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by our or any of our subsidiaries’ assets, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under Term Loan B, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.0:1. Revolver On October 31, 2019, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from $450 million to $750 million as well as to extend the maturity from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B, the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see “Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against” included within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Under the Revolver, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. 72 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under the Revolver (June 30, 2022—nil). On January 27, 2023, the Company drew down $450 million from the Revolver to finance the Micro Focus Acquisition. Acquisition Term Loan On December 1, 2022, we amended our first lien term loan facility (the Acquisition Term Loan), dated as of August 25, 2022, to increase the aggregate commitments under the senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility from an aggregate principal amount of $2.585 billion to an aggregate principal amount of $3.585 billion. On January 31, 2023, the Company drew down the entire amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees, of which the net proceeds were used to finance the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 19
—
“Acquisitions” for more details). The Acquisition Term Loan has a seven-year term from the date of funding, and repayments under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of the Acquisition Term Loan, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan will bear interest at rates as specified in the Acquisition Term Loan.
The Acquisition Term Loan has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by the Company’s or any of the Company’s subsidiaries’ assets, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under the Acquisition Term Loan, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4.5:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.0:1. The Acquisition Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan, and is secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver, Term Loan B and the Senior Secured Notes 2027. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did not record any interest expense relating to the Acquisition Term Loan.
The foregoing description of the Acquisition Term Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Acquisition Term Loan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 25, 2022. Bridge Loan On August 25, 2022, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (Bridge Loan) which provided for commitments of up to $2 billion to finance a portion of the repayment of Micro Focus’ existing debt. On December 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Bridge Loan that reallocated commitments under the Bridge Loan to the Acquisition Term Loan. In connection with the amendment to the Bridge Loan and the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to zero and the Bridge Loan was terminated, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $8.1 million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs (see Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net” for more details). As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under the Bridge Loan. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did not record any interest expense relating to the Bridge Loan.
The foregoing description of the Bridge Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bridge Loan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC on August 25, 2022. For further details relating to our debt, please see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Shelf Registration Statement
On December 6, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective automatically (the Shelf Registration Statement). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for primary and secondary offerings from time to time of equity, debt and other securities, including Common Shares, Preference Shares, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, purchase contracts, units and subscription receipts. A short-form base shelf prospectus qualifying
73 Table of Contents the distribution of such securities was concurrently filed with Canadian securities regulators on December 6, 2021. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators. Share Repurchase Plan / Normal Course Issuer Bid On November 5, 2020, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2020, up to an aggregate of $350 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the TSX and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.
The Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act (Rule 10b-18). Purchases made under the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were subject to a limit of 13,618,774 shares (representing 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were cancelled. On November 4, 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we may purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2021, up to an aggregate of $350 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2022 Normal-Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we paid for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18. All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan were cancelled.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we did not repurchase and cancel any Common Shares (three and six months ended December 31, 2021—1,809,559 Common Shares, respectively, for $91.0 million, respectively).
Normal Course Issuer Bid The Company established the Fiscal 2021 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan. The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2021 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2020 until November 11, 2021 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,618,774 (representing 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 143,424 Common Shares, which was 25% of 573,699 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2020), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18. The Company renewed the Fiscal 2022 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan. The TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2022 NCIB pursuant to which the Company could purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2021 until November 11, 2022 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,638,008 (representing 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of October 31, 2021), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 112,590 Common Shares, which is 25% of 450,361 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended
74 Table of Contents October 31, 2021), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18. Commitments and Contractual Obligations

Please see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. The table above does not reflect the amounts drawn on the Revolver or the Acquisition Term Loan related to the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition subsequent to December 31, 2022. (2) Represents the undiscounted future minimum lease payments under our operating leases liabilities and excludes sublease income expected to be received under our various sublease agreements with third parties. Please see Note 6 “Leases” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Guarantees and Indemnifications We have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Occasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Litigation We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters. 75 Table of Contents Contingencies CRA Matter As part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of December 31, 2022, in connection with the CRA's reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $72 million. As of December 31, 2022, we have provisionally paid approximately $32 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA's audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within “Long-term income taxes recoverable” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability. We strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing. Even if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above. The CRA has audited Fiscal 2017 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. On January 27, 2022, the CRA issued a notice of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of assets in Canada. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute. We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is currently in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019. Carbonite Class Action Complaint On August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made
76 Table of Contents materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite’s Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the “Securities Actions”). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. The motion was fully briefed in June 2020 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss the Securities Actions was held on October 15, 2020. Following the hearing, on October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants’ motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit, and will continue to vigorously defend the matter. Carbonite vs Realtime Data On February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas “Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL).” Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite’s cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data’s complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation. Please also see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loans, revolving loans and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest rate risk Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our Term Loan B, Revolver and Acquisition Term Loan.
As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of $952.5 million on Term Loan B. Term Loan B bears a floating interest rate of 1.75% plus LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, an adverse change of one percent on the interest rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on Term Loan B by approximately $9.5 million, assuming that the loan balance as of December 31, 2022 is outstanding for the entire period (June 30, 2022—$9.6 million). As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed rate that is dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. As of December 31, 2022, with no outstanding balance on the Revolver, an adverse change of one percent on the interest rate would have no effect on our annual interest payment (June 30, 2022—nil). 77 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan. As of December 31, 2022, with no outstanding balance on the Acquisition Term Loan, an adverse change of one percent on the interest rate would have no effect on our annual interest payment (June 30, 2022—nil). For more information regarding the impact of LIBOR and SOFR rates, see “Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against” included within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022. Foreign currency risk Foreign currency transaction risk We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term and are transacted in non-functional currency. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates.
We have hedged certain of our Canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in Canada. Based on the CAD foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022, a one cent change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of $0.7 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts (June 30, 2022—$0.5 million). Additionally, in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, in August 2022, the Company entered into certain derivative transactions to meet certain foreign currency obligations related to the purchase price of the Micro Focus Acquisition, mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the GBP denominated purchase price and mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the EUR denominated existing debt held by Micro Focus. The Company entered into the following derivatives: (i) three deal-contingent forward contracts, (ii) a non-contingent forward contract, and (iii) EUR/USD cross currency swaps. These instruments were entered into as economic hedges to mitigate foreign currency risks associated with the Micro Focus Acquisition. The instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting at inception. Based on the deal contingent and non-contingent forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022, a one cent change in the British Pound to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $18.0 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing deal-contingent forward and non-contingent forward contracts (June 30, 2022—nil). Based on the cross currency swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2022, a one cent change in the Euro to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $1.3 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing cross currency swaps (June 30, 2022—nil). Foreign currency translation risk Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. In particular, the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in U.S. dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets).
The following table shows our cash and cash equivalents denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022 (equivalent in U.S. dollar): (In thousands) U.S. Dollar  Equivalent at
December 31, 2022 U.S. Dollar  Equivalent at
June 30, 2022 Euro $ 230,238  $ 254,546  British Pound 50,246  44,020  Canadian Dollar 22,594  14,640  Swiss Franc 47,714  48,674  Other foreign currencies 157,781  127,060  Total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies 508,573  488,940  U.S. Dollar 2,312,354  1,204,801  Total cash and cash equivalents

78 Table of Contents cash and cash equivalents we would report in equivalent U.S. dollars would decrease by $50.9 million (June 30, 2022—$48.9 million), assuming we have not entered into any derivatives discussed above under “Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.” Item 4.
Controls and Procedures (A) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act (according to Rule 13(a)-15(e)) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (B) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) Based on the evaluation completed by our management, in which our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated, our management has concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 79 Table of Contents Part II - Other Information Item 1A.
Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022. These are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. Risks Related to the Micro Focus Acquisition We may fail to realize the benefits expected from the Micro Focus Acquisition, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations The anticipated benefits we expect from the Micro Focus Acquisition are, necessarily, based on projections and assumptions about our combined business with Micro Focus, which may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the Micro Focus Acquisition on a timely basis or at all, including realizing the anticipated synergies from the Micro Focus Acquisition in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or cost expectations or at all. Achieving the benefits of the Micro Focus Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the business and operations of Micro Focus successfully and efficiently with our business. The challenges involved in this integration, which may be complex and time-consuming, include the following: • successfully managing relationships with our strategic partners, combined supplier and customer base; • coordinating and integrating independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs; • coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company’s capabilities and the direction of product development; • limitations or restrictions required by regulatory authorities on the ability of Micro Focus’ and our management to conduct planning regarding the integration of the two companies; • difficulties in integrating the systems and process of two companies with complex operations including multiple sites; • the increased scale resulting from the Micro Focus Acquisition; • retaining key employees; • implementing expected cost synergies of $400 million; • obligations that we will have to counterparties of Micro Focus that arise as a result of the change in control of Micro Focus; and • the diversion of management attention from other important business objectives. If we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business of the size and complexity of Micro Focus, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Micro Focus Acquisition and our revenue, expenses, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. The use of cash and incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions We have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding following closing the Micro Focus Acquisition. As of December 31, 2022 we had $5.3 billion of total indebtedness. In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, on January 27, 2023, we drew down on our Revolver for $450 million, and on January 31, 2023 we drew down the entire amount of our Acquisition Term Loan, less original issuance discount and other fees. The Acquisition Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes 2027 are secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver and Term Loan B. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: • increasing our debt service obligations, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general purposes and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; • increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; 80 Table of Contents • expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under Term Loan B and the Revolver are variable;
• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes;
• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; • placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;
• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; and • restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions. In addition, a breach of the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. For more information on our indebtedness, see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the scope and size of our operations and business has substantially changed and will result in certain incremental risks to us. We cannot provide assurance that our expansion in scope and size will be successful The Micro Focus Acquisition substantially expands the scope and size of our business by adding substantial assets and operations to our existing business. The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. Our senior management’s attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the assets acquired in the Micro Focus Acquisition. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may also encounter risks, costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated liabilities and use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect. We may not be able to integrate the Micro Focus business into our existing operations on our anticipated timelines or realize the full expected economic benefits of the Micro Focus Acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also encounter risk, costs and expenses associated with preparing periodic reporting and consolidated financial statements following the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition. The expansion of effective internal controls over financial reporting and adequate disclosure controls and procedures over the Micro Focus business will be necessary to provide reliable financial reports and reporting. Micro Focus identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, which was subsequently remediated. In the course of applying our internal controls framework to the Micro Focus business we may identify other material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or other deficiencies, which could result in our determining we have a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting which could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. Also, Micro Focus’ historical financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Micro Focus provides public financial statements semi-annually, with a fiscal year end of October 31. Given such differences, it may be difficult for us to integrate systems in a timely fashion to produce financial statements following the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition. In addition, the consummation of the Micro Focus Acquisition may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition described in the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. We have incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition that could adversely affect our results of operations We have incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition and related transactions to obtain financing for the Micro Focus Acquisition, including entering into certain derivative transactions in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition as further described herein. We anticipate mark-to-market valuation adjustments for certain derivative transactions, based on foreign currency fluctuations. For more information on our mark-to-market derivatives, see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 22 “Other Income (Expense), Net” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations. Additional
81 Table of Contents unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Furthermore, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance expenses and restructuring charges in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, which may adversely affect our operating results following the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Micro Focus’ provision for income taxes and any ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts initially recorded and such differences could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. As disclosed in Micro Focus’ Current Report on Form 6-K for the six months ended April 30, 2022 and Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended October 31, 2021, U.K. tax authorities have challenged certain historic tax filing positions of Micro Focus. Based on Micro Focus’ assessment of the value of the underlying tax benefit under dispute, and as supported by external professional advice, it believes that it has no liability in respect of these matters and therefore no tax charge was recorded in current or previous periods. Although Micro Focus believes its assessment is reasonable, no assurance can be made regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters. Micro Focus is also subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgment has been applied in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes may be impacted by various internal and external factors that could have favorable or unfavorable effects, including changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, results of audits, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years' items, the impact of transactions completed, the structuring of activities undertaken, the application of complex transfer pricing rules, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in overall mix and levels of income before taxes. Further, due to Micro Focus’ complex acquisitive history, it could become subject to additional tax audits in jurisdictions in which it has not historically been subject to examination. As a result, Micro Focus’ worldwide provision for income taxes and any ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts initially recorded and such differences could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.
For more information on certain Micro Focus tax matters, see Note 10 (Taxation) to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Micro Focus for the six months ended April 30, 2022, included in its Current Report on Form 6-K furnished to the SEC on June 22, 2022, and Item 3.D (Risk Factors) and Note 7 (Taxation) to the consolidated financial statements of Micro Focus as of October 31, 2021, each included in the Annual Report on Form 20-F of Micro Focus for the year ended October 31, 2021. Following completion of the Acquisition, we may inherit litigation that could materially adversely affect us. From time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, Micro Focus has and may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time consuming and expensive, could divert Micro Focus' and our management's attention away from their regular business and, if such legal proceedings are adversely resolved against Micro Focus, such result could have a material adverse effect on our combined business, operating results or financial condition following completion of the Acquisition. See Micro Focus' Current Report on Form 6-K for the six months ended April 30, 2022 and Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended October 31, 2021 for further information on certain Micro Focus litigation matters.
