FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The discussions of Trio-Tech International’s (the “Company”) business and activities set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) and in other past and future reports and announcements by the Company may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and assumptions regarding future activities and results of operations of the Company. In light of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company: market acceptance of Company products and services; changing business conditions or technologies and volatility in the semiconductor industry, which could affect demand for the Company’s products and services; the impact of competition; problems with technology; product development schedules; delivery schedules; changes in military or commercial testing specifications which could affect the market for the Company’s products and services; difficulties in profitably integrating acquired businesses, if any, into the Company; risks associated with conducting business internationally and especially in Asia, including currency fluctuations and devaluation, currency restrictions, local laws and restrictions and possible social, political and economic instability; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations; ongoing public health issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic both nationally and internationally; the trade tension between U.S. and China; inflation; the war in Ukraine; other economic, financial and regulatory factors beyond the Company’s control and uncertainties relating to our ability to operate our business in China; uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and the fact that rules and regulation in China can change quickly with little advance notice, along with the risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operation at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could result in a material change in our operations, financial performance and/or the value of our common stock, no par value (“Common Stock”) or impair our ability to raise money. Other than statements of historical fact, all statements made in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements regarding industry prospects, future results of operations or financial position, and statements of our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospective and future financial results and condition. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “potential,” “believes,” “can impact,” “continue,” or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are inherently difficult to predict, which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from our expectations, forecasts and assumptions.
Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, changed circumstances, or the occurrence of unanticipated events. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

326:
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
(Topic
326 ):
Troubled Debt Restructurings
(“TDR")
and Vintage Disclosures
(“ASU
2022 - 02” ), which require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic
326 - 20.
The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that ASU
2022 - 02

no
significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In
November 2021,
FASB issued ASU
2021 - 10
ASC Topic
832:
Government Assistance
(“Topic
832” ): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance
(“ASU

2021 - 10
is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2021
for all entities except
not -for-profit entities and employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics
960,

Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Topic
326
is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2022.
The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that ASU
2016 - 03
has
no

4.     TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions, and although management generally does
not
require collateral, letters of credit
may
be required from the customers in certain circumstances.
Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. Management includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible in the allowance for doubtful accounts. After all reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, management believed the allowance for doubtful accounts as of
December 31, 2022,
and
June 30, 2022,
was adequate.

Rental Property I - MaoYe Property
In the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2008,
TTCQ purchased an office in Chongqing, China from MaoYe Property Ltd. (“MaoYe”) for a total cash purchase price of RMB
5,554 , or approximately $ 894 . During the year ended
June 30, 2019,
the Company sold
thirteen
of the
fifteen
units constituting the MaoYe Property. Management has decided
not
to sell the remaining
two
units of MaoYe properties in the near future, due to current conditions of the property market in China. The lease agreement, which was entered into on
February 10, 2022
has been terminated on
October 2022.
A new agreement has been secured and will be effective from
February 1, 2023
for a period of
4
years at a monthly rate of
RMB15,
or approximately $ 2 , after termination of the previous agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, monthly rental will increase by
5%
each year from
third
year onwards.

and $ 8

3,600 , or approximately $ 580 . As of
December 31, 2022,
TTCQ had
not
received the title deed for properties purchased from JiangHuai. While the above is
not
expected to affect the property’s market value, the COVID- 19
pandemic and current economic situation is likely to cause delays in court to consummate the execution of the sale.

not
generate any rental income for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021.

4,025,
or approximately $ 648 . The development was completed, the property was transferred to TTCQ in
April 2013
and the title deed was received during the

commercial properties for a period of
1
year at a monthly rate of

and $ 14
for the same period in Fiscal

10 % investment in the Joint Venture. The Developer paid the Company a management fee of RMB
5,000
in cash upon signing of the Agreement, with a remaining fee of RMB
5,000
payable upon fulfilment of certain conditions in accordance with the Agreement. The Company further reduced its investment by RMB
137 , or approximately
$22,
through the losses from operations incurred by the Joint Venture.
In Fiscal
2014,
the Company disposed of its entire
10%
interest in the Joint Venture but, to date, has
not
received payment in full. The Company recognized a disposal based on the recorded net book value of RMB
5,000 , or equivalent to $ 803 , from net considerations paid, in accordance with GAAP under ASC Topic
845
Non-monetary Consideration. It is presented under “Other Assets” as noncurrent assets to defer the recognition of the gain on the disposal of the
10 % interest in the Joint Venture investment until such time that the consideration is paid, so the gain can be ascertained.
b)
Amounts of RMB
5,000 , or approximately $ 814 , as disclosed in Note
5,
plus the interest receivable on long-term loan receivable of RMB
1,250 , or approximately $ 200 , and impairment on interest of RMB
906 , or approximately $ 150 .
The shop lots are to be delivered to TTCQ upon completion of the construction of the shop lots in the Project. The initial targeted date of completion was in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2017.
However, the progress has been delayed as the developer is currently undergoing asset reorganization process, to re-negotiate with their creditors to complete the project.
During the
fourth
quarter of Fiscal
2021,
the Company accrued an impairment charge of $ 1,580
related to the doubtful recovery of the down payment on property in the Project in Chongging, China. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge due to increased uncertainties regarding the project’s viability, given the developers weakening financial condition as well as uncertainties arising from the negative real-estate environment in China, implementation of control measures on real-estate lending in China and its relevant government policies, together with effects of the ongoing pandemic. The local court is verifying the documents due to the sizable number of creditors as of
December 31, 2022.

13.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Deposits with banks are
not
insured by the local government or agency and are consequently exposed to risk of loss. The Company believes that the probability of bank failure, causing loss to the Company, is remote.
The Company is, from time to time, the subject of litigation claims and assessments arising out of matters occurring in its normal business operations. In the opinion of management, resolution of these matters will
not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

14.     BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company operated in
four
segments; the testing service industry (which performs structural and electronic tests of semiconductor devices), the designing and manufacturing of equipment (assembly of equipment that tests the structural integrity of integrated circuits and other products), distribution of various products from other manufacturers in Singapore and Asia and the real estate segment in China.
The cost of equipment, current year investment in new equipment and depreciation expense are allocated into respective segments based on primary purpose for which the equipment was acquired.
All intersegment sales were sales from the manufacturing segment to the testing and distribution segment. Total intersegment sales were $ 115
and $ 669
for
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
as compared to $ 232
and $ 820
for the same period in fiscal
2022.
Corporate assets consisted primarily of cash and prepaid expenses. Corporate expenses consisted primarily of stock option expense, salaries, insurance, professional expenses and directors' fees. Corporate expenses are allocated to the
four
segments on a predetermined fixed amount calculated based on the annual budgeted sales, except the Malaysia operation, which is calculated based on actual sales. The following segment information table includes segment operating income or loss after including corporate expenses allocated to the segments, which gets eliminated in the consolidation.

16.    INCOME TAX
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. The statute of limitations, in general, is open for years
2016
to
2022
for tax authorities in those jurisdictions to audit or examine income tax returns. The Company is under annual review by the tax authorities of the respective jurisdiction to which the subsidiaries belong.
Due to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company is subject to a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).  GILTI is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Companies subject to GILTI have the option to account for the GILTI tax as a period cost if and when incurred, or to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences including outside basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost. GILTI expense was $ 41
and $ 83
for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
as compared to $ 23
and $ 46
for the same period in Fiscal
2022.
The Company's income tax expense was $ 241
and $ 466
for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022,
as compared to $ 153
and $ 333
for the same period in Fiscal
2022.
Our effective tax rate (“ETR”) from continuing operations was
30.2 % and
15.16 % for the quarters ended
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021,
respectively. The increase in income tax expense and effective tax rate was due to the following:
1.
The Thailand operation incurred higher income tax due to higher income generated in period ended
December 31, 2022
compared to same period last fiscal year.
2.
The Company recognized higher GILTI expenses due to higher income derived from controlled foreign corporation.
The Company accrues penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits when necessary as a component of penalties and interest expense, respectively. The Company had
no
unrecognized tax benefits or related accrued penalties or interest expense at
December 31, 2022.
In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not
be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on these criteria, management believes it is more likely than
not
the Company will
not
realize the benefits of the federal, state, and foreign deductible differences. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets recorded in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.
17.    REVENUE
The Company generates revenue primarily from
3
different segments: Manufacturing, Testing and Distribution. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company’s revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of
third
parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer.
-
15 -
Significant Judgments
The Company’s arrangements with its customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis (“SSP”). Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. The Company typically establishes the SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar clients. The Company
may
estimate SSP by considering internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices in certain circumstances.
Warranties, discounts and allowances are estimated using historical and recent data trends. The Company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is
not
probable in subsequent periods. The Company’s products and services are generally
not
sold with a right of return, nor has the Company experienced significant returns from or refunds to its customers.
Manufacturing
The Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of both front-end and back-end semiconductor test equipment and related peripherals, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services and the sale of spare parts. The Company’s revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of
third
parties, such as sales taxes.
The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. The Company uses judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators, including:
●
whether the Company has a present right to payment;
●
the customer has legal title;
●
the customer has physical possession;
●
the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and
●
the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same equipment, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).
Not
all indicators need to be met for the Company to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with its performance obligations of product installation and training services are deferred and recognized upon acceptance.
The majority of sales under the Manufacturing segment include a standard
12 -month warranty which are mainly assurance warranty and are
not
separate performance obligations. Warranty provided for some customized products
may
be classified as service warranties and are separate performance obligations. Transaction prices are allocated to this performance obligation using cost plus method. The portion of revenue associated with warranty service is deferred and recognized as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by the Company.
Testing
The Company renders testing services to manufacturers and purchasers of semiconductors and other entities who either lack testing capabilities or whose in-house screening facilities are insufficient. The Company primarily derives testing revenue from burn-in services, manpower supply and other associated services. SSP is directly observable from the sales orders. Revenue is allocated to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time depending upon terms of the sales order. Generally, there is
no
other performance obligation other than what has been stated inside the sales order for each of these sales.
Terms of contract that
may
indicate potential variable consideration include warranty, late delivery penalty and reimbursement to solve nonconformance issues for rejected products. Based on historical and recent data trends, it is concluded that these terms of the contract do
not
represent potential variable consideration. The transaction price is
not
contingent on the occurrence of any future event.
-
16 -
Distribution
The Company distributes complementary products, particularly equipment, industrial products and components by manufacturers mainly from the U.S., Europe and Taiwan. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at a point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. The Company uses judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators discussed above. The Company recognizes the revenue at a point in time, generally upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer or distributors, depending upon terms of the sales order.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and collections
may
result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, contract assets, customer advances, deposits and contract liabilities. The Company’s payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment of
70%
to
90%
of total contract consideration within
30
to
60
days of shipment with the remainder payable within
30
days of acceptance. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do
not
include a significant financing component.
The following table is the reconciliation of contract balances.

Employee Stock Option Plan
The Company’s
2017
Employee Plan permits the grant of stock options to its employees covering up to an aggregate of
300,000
shares of Common Stock. The Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the

to increase the shares covered thereby from
300,000
shares to an aggregate of
600,000
shares, which amendment was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the annual meeting held in

Under the

Employee Plan, all options must be granted with an exercise price of
not
less than fair value as of the grant date and the options granted must be exercisable within a maximum of
ten
years after the date of grant, or such lesser period of time as is set forth in the stock option agreements. The options
may
be exercisable (a) immediately as of the effective date of the stock option agreement granting the option, or (b) in accordance with a schedule related to the date of the grant of the option, the date of
first
employment, or such other date as
may
be set by the Compensation Committee. Generally, options granted under the
2017
Employee Plan are exercisable within
five
years after the date of grant and vest over the period as follows:
25 % vesting on the grant date and the remaining balance vesting in equal installments on the next
three
succeeding anniversaries of the grant date. The share-based compensation will be recognized in terms of the grade method on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting portion of the award.

TRIO-TECH INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT ’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
Overview
The following should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes in Item I above and with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, the information under the headings
“ Management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Trio-Tech International (“TTI”) was incorporated in 1958 under the laws of the State of California. As used herein, the term “Trio-Tech” or “Company” or “we” or “us” or “Registrant” includes Trio-Tech International and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates. Our mailing address and executive offices are located at Block 1008 Toa Payoh North, Unit 03-09 Singapore 318996, and our telephone number is (65) 6265 3300.
The Company is a provider of reliability test equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. Our customers rely on us to verify that their semiconductor components meet or exceed the rigorous reliability standards demanded for aerospace, communications and other electronics products.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, TTI generated approximately 99.9% of its revenue from its three core business segments in the test and measurement industry, i.e., manufacturing of test equipment (“Manufacturing”), testing services (“Testing”) and distribution of test equipment (“Distribution”). The Real Estate segment contributed only 0.01% to the total revenue during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Manufacturing
TTI develops and manufactures an extensive range of test equipment used in the “front-end” and the “back-end” manufacturing processes of semiconductors. Our equipment includes leak detectors, autoclaves, centrifuges, burn-in systems and boards, HAST testers, temperature-controlled chucks, wet benches and more.
Testing
TTI provides comprehensive electrical, environmental, and burn-in testing services to semiconductor manufacturers in our testing laboratories in Asia and the United States (“U.S.”). Our customers include both manufacturers and end users of semiconductor and electronic components who look to us when they do not want to establish their own facilities. The independent tests are performed to industry and customer specific standards.
Distribution
In addition to marketing our proprietary products, we distribute complementary products made by manufacturers mainly from the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan. The products include environmental chambers, handlers, interface systems, vibration systems, shaker systems, solderability testers and other semiconductor equipment. Besides equipment, we also distribute a wide range of components such as connectors, sockets, LCD display panels and touch screen panels. Furthermore, our range of products are mainly targeted for industrial products rather than consumer products whereby the life cycle of the industrial products can last from three years to seven years.
Real Estate
Our real estate segment generates investment income from the investments made and rental revenue received from real estate that we purchased in Chongqing, China.
Critical Accounting Estimates & Policies
The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates and policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Presentation and Summary of significant Accounting Policies” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. In addition, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 for a complete description of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue within our four current segments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, is discussed below.
-27-
Manufacturing Segment
Revenue in the Manufacturing segment as a percentage of total revenue was 40.7% and 35.5% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, an increase of 8.4% and 1.9% of total revenue when compared to 32.3% and 33.6% in the same period of Fiscal 2022. The revenue increased by $1,516 to $5,044 from $3,528 and increased by $1,539 to $8,629 from $7,090 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Revenue in the Manufacturing segment from one customer accounted for 38.0% and 50.9% of our total revenue in the Manufacturing segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 28.2% and 42.0% of our total revenue in the Manufacturing segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
Testing Services Segment
The Testing segment's revenue was 45.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a marginal increase of 0.2%, compared to 45.4% for the same period of Fiscal 2022. Revenue in the Testing segment was 49.4% as a percentage of total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022. Total revenue increased by $682 to $5,648 and increased by $2,446 to $12,012 from $4,966 and $9,566 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the same periods of Fiscal 2022.
The revenue in the Testing segment from one customer accounted for 40.9% and 63.0% of our revenue in the Testing segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 45.6% and 63.3% of our total revenue in the Testing segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The future revenue in the Testing segment will be affected by the demands of this customer if the customer base cannot be increased. Demand for testing services varies from country to country, depending on any changes taking place in the market and our customers’ forecasts. As it is challenging to forecast fluctuations in the market accurately, management believes it is necessary to maintain testing facilities in close proximity to the customers in order to make it convenient for them to send us their newly manufactured parts for testing and to enable us to maintain a share of the market.
Distribution Segment
Revenue in the Distribution segment was 13.7% and 15.1% as a percentage of total revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, a decrease of 8.5% and 5.8%, compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022. Total revenue decreased by $726 to $1,694 and decreased by $742 to $3,676 from $2,420 and $4,418 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022.
The revenue in the Distribution segment from one customer accounted for 78.9% and 80.8% of our revenue in the Distribution segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 82.4% and 74.4% of our total revenue in the Distribution segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Demand for the Distribution segment varies depending on the demand for our customers’ products, the changes taking place in the market, and our customers’ forecasts.  Hence it is difficult to forecast fluctuations in the market accurately.
Real Estate Segment
The Real Estate segment revenue decreased to $4 and $12 from $8 and $19 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022.
Uncertainties and Remedies
There are several influencing factors which create uncertainties when forecasting performance, such as the constantly changing nature of technology, specific requirements from the customer, decline in demand for certain types of burn-in devices or equipment, decline in demand for testing services and fabrication services, and other similar factors. One factor that influences uncertainty is the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. Another is that some customers are unable to provide a forecast of the products required in the upcoming weeks; hence it is difficult to plan for the resources needed to meet these customers’ requirements due to short lead time and last-minute order confirmation. This will normally result in a lower margin for these products as it is more expensive to purchase materials in a short time frame.  However, the Company has taken certain actions and formulated certain plans to deal with and to help mitigate these unpredictable factors.  For example, in order to meet manufacturing customers’ demands upon short notice, the Company maintains higher inventories but continues to work closely with its customers to avoid stockpiling.  We believe that we have improved customer service through our efforts to keep our staff up to date on the newest technology and stressing the importance of understanding and meeting the stringent requirements of our customers. Finally, the Company is exploring new markets and products, looking for new customers, and upgrading and improving burn-in technology while at the same time searching for improved testing methods for higher technology chips.

The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expense in its subsidiaries. Strengthening of the United States dollar (“U.S. Dollar”) relative to foreign currencies adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the U.S. Dollar’s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. Dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.
As of December 2022, although we have seen improvements in both our operations and those of our suppliers, we may continue to experience supply shortages as well as inflationary cost pressures in at least the near term. Risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. We continue to monitor and evaluate the business impact to react proactively.
On August 9, 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act) was enacted in the United States. The CHIPS Act will provide financial incentives to the semiconductor industry which are primarily directed at manufacturing activities within the United States. We continue to evaluate the business impact and potential opportunities related to the CHIPS Act. As of date, we do not see any direct effect of the CHIPS Act on the Company in the foreseeable future.
There are legal and operational risks associated with having operations in China. These risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock or could limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. In recent past, the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”) government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.
The Company and its subsidiaries do not have any variable interest entities based in China. Our business primarily consists of semiconductor testing and burn-in services for the automotive industry, avionics, and others. Our businesses are not impacted by anti-monopoly policies, variable interest entities policies, or data security policies, nor are our businesses subject to extraordinary oversight from the Chinese government.

Overall Gross Margin
Overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.4% to 26.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 26.5% for the same period of Fiscal 2022. Gross profits increased by $445 to $3,335 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $2,890 for the same period in Fiscal 2022.
Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue in the Manufacturing segment increased by 5.2% to 23.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 18.5% for the same period in Fiscal 2022. Gross profits in the Manufacturing segment increased by $541 to $1,195 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $654 for the same period in Fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to a higher proportion of high profit margin product sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022.
Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue in the Testing segment decreased by 4.1% to 33.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 37.8% in the same period of Fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was mainly due to lower margins in the Singapore and Tianjin testing operations resulting from lower demand due to inventory corrections made by customers in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. In absolute dollar amounts, gross profit in the testing segment increased by $24 to $1,901 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $1,877 for the same period of Fiscal 2022.
Gross profit margin of the Distribution segment is not only affected by the market price of the products we distribute, but also the mix of products we distribute, which frequently changes as a result of fluctuations in market demand. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue in the Distribution segment decreased by 0.4% to 14.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 15.3% in the same period of Fiscal 2022.  Gross profit in the Distribution segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $253, a decrease of $117, compared to $370 in the same period of Fiscal 2022.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, gross loss in the Real Estate segment was $14, as compared to $11 for the same period of Fiscal 2022.

General and administrative expense decreased by $28 or 1.5%, from $1,947 to $1,919 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022. The decrease in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to the bonus provision adjustments in this quarter that offset the increase of administrative expense relating to the Company’s new subsidiary Trio-Tech Jiangsu, which was setup in the third quarter of Fiscal 2022.
Selling expense increased by $37, or 23.7%, from $156 to $193 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022. The increase in selling expense was primarily attributable to an increase in commission costs in the Manufacturing segment of the Singapore operations as a result of an increase in commissionable revenue, and an increase in travel costs due to increased business travel in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, compared to the same quarter of Fiscal 2022.

Income from Operations
Income from operations was $1,052 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $396, compared to profit of $656 from operations for the same period of Fiscal 2022. This was mainly due to higher revenue and improved gross profit margin from Manufacturing and Testing segments.

Other income decreased by $624 from $381 to other expense of $243 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in Fiscal 2022. The decrease was mainly contributed by a negative foreign currency impact in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and the absence of one-time commission income that was earned in the same period in Fiscal 2022.
Our net income is impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollars since the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is not U.S. Dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movement negatively impacted our net income due to the strengthening of the Singapore dollars against the U.S. Dollars.
Income Tax Expense
The Company's income tax expense was $241 and $153 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income.
Non-controlling Interest
As of December 31, 2022, we held a 55% interest in Trio-Tech (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., Trio-Tech (Kuala Lumpur) Sdn. Bhd., SHI International Pte. Ltd., and 52% interest in PT. SHI Indonesia. We also held a 76% interest in Prestal Enterprise Sdn. Bhd and 51% interest in Trio-Tech JiangSu Co. Ltd. The share of non-controlling interest in the net profit from the subsidiaries for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $58, an increase of $57 compared to the share of non-controlling interest in the net income from the subsidiaries of $1 for the same period of Fiscal 2022. The increase in the net income shared by non-controlling interest in the subsidiaries was attributable to the increase in net income generated by the China operation.

Selling expense increased by $63, or 20.8%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $303 to $366 compared to the same period of Fiscal 2022. The increase in selling expense was primarily attributable to an increase in commission expense in the Manufacturing segment of Singapore operation as a result of an increase in commissionable revenue and increased travel costs.
Income / (Loss) from Operations
Income from operations was $2,136 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,626 for the same period of Fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly due to the increase in gross profit margin, offset by an increase in operating expense, as discussed earlier.

Other expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $64, a decrease of $606 compared to other income of $542 for the same period of Fiscal 2022. The decrease was mainly contributed by a negative foreign currency impact in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and the absence of one-time commission income that was earned in the same period in Fiscal 2022.
Our net income is impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar since the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is not the U.S. Dollar. During the second quarter in Fiscal 2023, exchange rate movement negatively impacted our net income due to the strengthening of Singapore dollars against the U.S. Dollar which was partially offset by the exchange gain that arose in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $466, an increase of $133 compared to of $333 for the same period of Fiscal 2022. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to increase in the taxable income across the Company in the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Financial Condition
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 total assets increased by $2,775 to $46,196 compared to $43,421 as of June 30, 2022.

Cash and cash equivalents were $6,379 as at December 31, 2022, reflecting an decrease of $1,319 from $7,698 as at June 30, 2022, primarily due to placement of additional term deposits and repayment in lines of credit for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Short-term deposits and restricted term deposits were $7,484 as at December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of $386 from $7,098 as at June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional term deposits placement and also foreign currency movement.
As at December 31, 2022, the trade accounts receivable balance increased by $1,740 to $13,332, from $11,592 as at June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in overall revenue of all entities on a consolidated basis.

Inventories as at December 31, 2022, were $3,219, an increase of $961, compared to $2,258 as at June 30, 2022. The increase in inventories was in line with the backlog in the manufacturing and distribution segments of our Singapore operations.
Prepaid expenses were $610 as at December 31, 2022 compared to $1,215 as at June 30, 2022. This was mainly due to the asset capitalization of down payments made for the purchase of equipment in the China operation.
Investment properties’ net in China was $533 as at December 31, 2022 and $585 as at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange movement between June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022.
Property, plant and equipment increased by $2,589 from $8,481 as at June 30, 2022, to $11,070 as at December 31, 2022, mainly due to the acquisition of new property, plant and equipment in the China operations. The increase was partially offset by the depreciation charged for the period and the foreign currency exchange movement between June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022.
Other assets increased by $4 to $141 as at December 31, 2022 compared to $137 as at June 30, 2022.  This was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange movement between June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022.

Accrued expense increased by $803 to $6,807 as at December 31, 2022, as compared to $6,004 as at June 30, 2022. The increase in accrued expense was mainly due to an increase in accruals relating to acquisition pf property, plant and equipment in the China operations.
There was no significant change in bank loans payable as it decreased by $48 to $1,696 as at December 31, 2022, as compared to $1,744 as of June 30, 2022. This was due to the repayments made in the Malaysia operations.
Finance leases decreased by $67 to $170 as at December 31, 2022, as compared to $237 as at June 30, 2022. This was due to the repayments made in the Singapore and Malaysia operations.

Other non-current liabilities increased by $1,144 to $1,172 as at December 31, 2022, as compared to $28 as at June 30, 2022.

It was partially offset by an increase of $420 in cash outflow from changes in inventories and operating lease in first half of Fiscal 2023 as compared to same period of Fiscal 2022.
