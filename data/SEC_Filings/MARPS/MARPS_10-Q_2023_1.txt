MARINE PETROLEUM TRUST AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
Note 1. Accounting
Policies
The financial statements herein include the financial statements of Marine Petroleum Trust (the “Trust”) and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Marine Petroleum Corporation (“MPC,” and collectively with the Trust, “Marine”). The financial statements are condensed and consolidated and should be read in conjunction with Marine’s Annual Report
on Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The financial statements included herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of Argent Trust Company (the “Trustee”), the Trustee of the
Trust, they include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods reported herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
Note 2. Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of Marine are prepared on the modified cash basis method and are not intended to present Marine’s financial
position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Under the modified cash basis method the financial statements of Marine differ from financial statements prepared
in conformity with GAAP because of the following:
•
Royalty income is recognized in the month when received by Marine rather than in the month of production.
•
Marine’s expenses (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees’ fees and
out-of-pocket
expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis in the month paid rather than in the month incurred. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in
amount may also be established if considered necessary, which would not be recorded under GAAP.
•
At the time the Trust was established, no determinable market value was available for the assets transferred to
the Trust; consequently, nominal values were assigned. Accordingly, no allowance for depletion has been included. All income from oil and natural gas royalties relate to proved developed oil and natural gas reserves.
The modified cash basis method of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,
Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts . Because the Trust’s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described
above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to or do not have a significant impact on the Trust’s financial statements.
Note 3.
Distributable Income
The Trust’s Indenture (the “Indenture”) provides that the Trustee is to distribute all cash in the
Trust, less an amount reserved for payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the 28 th
day of March, June, September and December of each year. If
the 28 th
day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the payments are to be made on the immediately succeeding business day. Total estimated reserve for future expenses deducted from
calculated distributable income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $109,759.
As stated under “Note 1. Accounting
Policies” above, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q
are the condensed and consolidated financial statements of the Trust and MPC. However, distributable income is paid from the
account balances of the Trust. Distributable income is comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned directly by the Trust, (ii) 98% of the royalties received from offshore Louisiana leases owned by MPC, which are retained by
and delivered to the Trust on a quarterly basis, (iii) cash distributions from the Trust’s interest in Tidelands Royalty Trust “B” (“Tidelands”), a separate royalty trust, until Tidelands was wrapped up
(iv) dividends paid by MPC, less (v) administrative expenses incurred by the Trust. Distributions fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to changes in oil and natural gas prices and production quantities and expenses incurred.

Note 4. Investment in Affiliate — Tidelands Royalty Trust “B”
At December 31, 2021, the Trust owned 32.6% of the outstanding units of beneficial interest in Tidelands, which entity was wound up prior
to June 30, 2022. Due to Tidelands being wound up prior to June 30, 2022, there was no market underlying the 452,366 units owned by the Trust at the time Tidelands was wound up. A reserve of $154,196 has been established for future
reporting and compliance issues that may arise in years to come and will be used for such transactions.
The following summary financial
statements have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Tidelands:

Tidelands was a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On March 8,
2019, Tidelands terminated the registration of its units under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and suspended its reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. As of that date, Tidelands’ obligations to file certain
reports with the SEC, including annual, quarterly and current reports on
Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and
Form 8-K, respectively,
were automatically and immediately suspended. The last regular distribution Marine received from Tidelands was in the fourth quarter of 2018. The term of Tidelands expired in
2021. Tidelands has been wound up and declared January
31, 2022 as the record date for the final distribution which was paid in February 2022.
Item 2.
Trustee’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Organization
Marine Petroleum Trust (the “Trust”) is a royalty trust that was created in 1956 under the laws of the State of Texas. Effective
February 20, 2018, Simmons Bank became corporate trustee of the Trust (“Simmons”) as a result of a merger between Simmons Bank and Southwest Bank, the former corporate trustee of the Trust. On November 4, 2021, Simmons announced
that it had entered into an agreement with Argent Trust Company, a Tennessee chartered trust company (the “Trustee”), pursuant to which Simmons would resign as trustee of the Trust and nominate Argent Trust Company as successor trustee of
the Trust. On March 21, 2022, the unitholders of the Trust, by way of written consent, voted (i) to approve the appointment of the Trustee as successor trustee to serve as trustee of the Trust once the resignation of Simmons took effect
and (ii) to not approve an amendment to the Indenture to permit a national bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States and having an unimpaired capital and surplus of at least $3,000,000.00 to serve as trustee of the
Trust.
6
Table of Contents
On September 23, 2022, upon request of Simmons, the District Court of Dallas County,
Texas, 298th Judicial District approved an order modifying Article VI, Section 8 of the Indenture to substitute “United States” for “State of Texas” so that it permits a successor trustee of the Trust to be a national bank,
state bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States and having unimpaired capital and surplus of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000). The full text of the Indenture, as modified by the court’s order is set
forth in Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The change in trustee was effective on December 30, 2022.
The
Trust’s Indenture provides that the term of the Trust will expire on June 1, 2041, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest.
The Trust is not permitted to engage in any business activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly
and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to payments from certain oil and natural gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, pursuant to license agreements and amendments between the Trust’s predecessors and Gulf Oil
Corporation (“Gulf”). As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1956, these interests were largely held by Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) and are now predominantly held by its assignees, including Arena
Energy, LP (collectively with Chevron and its assignees, the “Interest Owners”). The Trust holds title to interests in properties that are situated offshore of Texas.
The Trust’s wholly owned subsidiary, Marine Petroleum Corporation (“MPC,” and collectively with the Trust, “Marine”),
holds title to interests in properties that are situated offshore of Louisiana because at the time the Trust was created, trusts could not hold these interests under Louisiana law. MPC is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only
takes those actions that are necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties.
Marine’s rights are generally
referred to as overriding royalty interests in the oil and natural gas industry. An overriding royalty interest is created by an assignment by the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease. The royalty rights associated with an
overriding royalty interest terminate when the underlying lease terminates. All production and marketing functions are conducted by the working interest owners of the leases. Income from overriding royalties is paid to Marine either (i) on the
basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other minerals produced, saved or sold, or (ii) at the value at the wellhead as determined by industry standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead.
The Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations
(and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. The Trustee will provide the required
information and the contact information for the Trustee is below:
Argent Trust Company
2911 Turtle Creek Blvd., Suite 850
Dallas, Texas 75219
Telephone number: (855)
588-7839
Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for compliance with U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations.
Commodity Prices
The Trust’s income
and monthly distributions are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, (ii) market uncertainty and
(iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Trustee’s control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, include but are not limited to:
•
political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine;
7
Table of Contents
•
worldwide economic conditions;
•
weather conditions;
•
trade barriers;
•
public health concerns;
•
the supply and price of domestic and foreign crude oil or natural gas;
•
the level of consumer demand;
•
the price and availability of alternative fuels;
•
the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities;
•
the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and
•
the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation.
Although the Trustee cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will
be affected, gas royalty income for a given period generally relates to production three months prior to the period and crude oil royalty income for a given period generally relates to production two months prior to the period and will generally
approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production at the time of production. When crude oil and natural gas prices decline, the Trust is affected in two ways. First, distributable income from the Trust’s royalty
properties is reduced. Second, exploration and development activity by operators on the Trust’s royalty properties may decline as some projects may become uneconomic and are either delayed or eliminated. It is impossible to predict future crude
oil and natural gas price movements, and this reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to unitholders.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As stated in the Indenture, there is no requirement for capital due to the limited purpose of the Trust. The Trust’s only
obligation is to distribute the distributable income that is actually collected to unitholders. As an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty interests, the Trust collects royalties monthly, pays administrative expenses and disburses all net
royalties that are collected to its unitholders each quarter, subject to the availability of distributable income on the distribution date after the payment of expenses.
The Indenture (and MPC’s charter and
by-laws)
expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of
trade or business. The Trust’s oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets that are not being replaced due to the prohibition against investments. These restrictions, along with other factors, allow the Trust to be treated as a grantor
trust. As a grantor trust, all income and deductions for state and U.S. federal income tax purposes generally flow through to each individual unitholder. The State of Texas imposes a franchise tax, but the Trust does not believe that it is subject
to the franchise tax because at least 90% of its income is from passive sources. Please see Marine’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 for further information. MPC is
a taxable entity that pays state and U.S. federal income taxes and state franchise taxes. However, MPC’s income specifically excludes 98% of the oil and natural gas royalties collected by MPC, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust
because of the Trust’s net profits interest.
The Leases
Marine relies on public records for information regarding drilling and workover operations. The public records available up to the date of this
report indicate that there were no new well completions made during the three months ended December 31, 2022 on leases in which Marine has an interest. As of February 1, 2023, public records also indicated that there were no wells in the
process of being drilled or recompleted on other leases in which Marine has an interest.
Marine holds an overriding royalty interest that
is equal to three-fourths of one percent of the working interest and is calculated on the value at the well of any oil, natural gas or other minerals produced and sold from 55 leases covering 199,868 gross acres located in the Gulf of Mexico.
Marine’s overriding royalty interest applies only to existing leases and does not apply to any new leases that the Interest Owners may acquire.

Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,
Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts , Marine uses the modified cash basis
method of accounting. Under this accounting method, royalty income is recorded when received, and distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trustee of the Trust. Expenses of Marine (including accounting, legal, other
professional fees, trustees’ fees and
out-of-pocket
expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis. Marine also reports distributable income instead of net income
under the modified cash basis method of accounting. Cash reserves are permitted to be established by the Trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Marine did not have any changes in its critical accounting policies or estimates during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
Please see Marine’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 for a detailed discussion of its critical accounting policies.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Since the
Trust financial statements are prepared on a modified-cash basis, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust. No new accounting pronouncements have been adopted or issued that would have a significant impact on Marine’s
financial statements.
General
Marine’s royalty income is derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of third parties. Marine’s royalty income
fluctuates from period to period based upon factors beyond Marine’s control, including, without limitation, the number of productive wells drilled and maintained on leases that are subject to Marine’s interest, the level of production over
time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold.
Important aspects of Marine’s
operations are conducted by third parties. Marine’s royalty income is dependent on the operations of the working interest owners of the leases on which Marine has an overriding royalty interest. The oil and natural gas companies that lease
tracts subject to Marine’s interests are responsible for the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Marine. The only obligation of the working interest owners to Marine is to make monthly
overriding royalty payments that reflect Marine’s interest in the oil and natural gas sold. Marine’s distributions are processed and paid by its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.
The volume of oil and natural gas produced and the selling prices of such oil and natural gas are the primary factors in calculating
overriding royalty payments. Production is affected by the natural production decline of the producing wells, the number of new wells drilled and the number of existing wells that are
re-worked
and placed back
in production on the leases. Production from existing wells is anticipated to decrease in the future due to normal well depletion. The operators do not provide Marine with information regarding future drilling or
re-working
operations that could impact the oil and natural gas production from the leases for which Marine has an overriding royalty interest.
Summary of Operating Results
During the
six months ended December 31, 2022, the Trust realized approximately 94% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 6% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the
Trust realized approximately 93% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 7% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. Royalty income includes royalties from oil and natural gas received from producers.
Distributable income per unit for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.45 as compared to $0.19 for the comparable period in
2021. Distributions per unit amounted to $0.51 per unit for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase from distributions of $0.17 per unit for the comparable period in 2021. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
difference between distributable income per unit and distributions per unit resulted from timing differences between the closing of the financial statements and the determination date of the distribution amount to unitholders.

Table of Contents
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, oil production increased to 9,499 barrels
(bbls) from 6,917 bbls and natural gas production increased to 7,738 thousand cubic feet (mcf) from 6,775 mcf as compared to the comparable period in 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the average price realized for oil
increased to $100.65 per bbl as compared to the price of $66.06 realized for the comparable period in 2021 and the average price realized for natural gas (net of expenses) increased to $8.40 per mcf as compared to the average price of $5.46 realized
for the comparable period in 2021.

Results of Operations—Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Income from oil and natural gas royalties, increased to $425,321 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $264,692 realized
for the comparable period in 2021. Royalties increased for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in production of oil and gas, and also by a sharp increase in pricing
of oil and gas.
Distributable income increased to $378,969 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $181,444 realized for

Forward-Looking Statements
The
statements discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q
regarding Marine’s future financial performance and results, and other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements
as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. This report uses the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future
expectations, contain projections of Marine’s financial condition, and/or state other “forward-looking” information. Actual results may differ from expected results because of: reductions in price or demand for oil and natural gas,
which might then lead to decreased production or impair Marine’s ability to make distributions; the impact of
COVID-19
on future production and distributions; reductions in production due to the depletion
of existing wells or disruptions in service, which may be caused by storm damage to production facilities, blowouts or other production accidents, or geological changes such as cratering of productive formations; changes in regulations; general
economic conditions; actions and policies of petroleum-producing nations; other changes in domestic and international energy markets; and the expiration, termination or release of leases subject to Marine’s interests. Additional risks are set
forth in Marine’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Events may occur in the future that Marine is unable to accurately predict or over which it has no control. If
one or more of these uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.
Except as required by applicable securities laws, Marine does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
