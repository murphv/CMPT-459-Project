AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. General The accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of The Cooper Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the requirements of Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01 for financial statements required to be filed as a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless the context requires otherwise, terms "the Company", "we", "us", and "our" are used to refer collectively to The Cooper Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and related notes are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company continually monitors and evaluates the estimates used as additional information becomes available. Adjustments will be made to these provisions periodically to reflect new facts and circumstances that may indicate that historical experience may not be indicative of current and/or future results. Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10,
Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . This update requires annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively on November 1, 2022, and it did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

and subsequent amendment to the initial guidance: ASU 2021-01,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope
(collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 . ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024 .
Effective February 1, 2023, the Company transitioned its credit agreements from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The Company plans to adopt the guidance prospectively in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's financial position. No other recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Note 2. Acquisitions and Joint Venture All acquisitions were funded by cash generated from operations or facility borrowings.
For business acquisitions, the Company recorded tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the applicable date of acquisition. For asset acquisitions, the Company recorded tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated and relative fair values as of the applicable date of acquisition.
On November 1, 2022, CooperVision completed the acquisition of a privately-held U.S.-based company that provides a broad portfolio of technologically advanced contact lens products, including scleral and hybrid lenses. The purchase price of the
7 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) acquisition was $ 33.0  million. Based upon preliminary valuations, assets acquired primarily comprised of $ 12.6  million of customer relationship related intangibles, $ 7.6  million of technology, and $ 13.1  million of goodwill. The goodwill is
not
deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation is preliminary, and the Company is in the process of finalizing information primarily related to the effect on taxes and the corresponding impact on goodwill.
Refer to "Joint Venture" below for details on formation of a joint venture with Essilor International and related activities that occurred in fiscal year 2022 following the acquisition of SightGlass Vision, Inc. (SGV) in fiscal year 2021. On April 6, 2022, CooperSurgical entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire Cook Medical's Reproductive Health business, a manufacturer of minimally invasive medical devices focused on the fertility, obstetrics and gynecology markets. The aggregate consideration is $ 875.0  million in cash, with $ 675.0  million payable at the closing and the remaining $ 200.0  million payable in $ 50.0  million installments following each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the closing. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, such as receipt of required regulatory approvals. Generate Life Sciences ® On December 17, 2021, CooperSurgical completed the acquisition of
100 % of the equity interests in Generate Life Sciences (Generate), a privately held leading provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage (cord blood & cord tissue), and paid an aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $ 1.663  billion, reflecting working capital, and other adjustments. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of $ 1.5  billion in proceeds from the issuance of a senior unsecured term loan and available cash on hand. The following table summarizes the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (In millions) Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 58.6 Trade accounts receivable, net 18.1   Inventories 3.3   Prepaid expense and other current assets 33.1   Total current assets 113.1   Property, plant and equipment 42.6   Goodwill 1,173.9   Customer relationships 718.3   Trademarks 54.9   Other assets 21.5   Total assets acquired $ 2,124.3   Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 12.6   Employee compensation and benefits 12.3   Deferred revenue 71.4   Other current liabilities 11.6   Total current liabilities 107.9   Deferred tax liabilities 144.3   Lease liabilities 16.6   Deferred revenue 188.8   Other long-term liabilities 3.6   Total liabilities assumed $ 461.2   Total purchase price $ 1,663.1   Customer relationships will be amortized over
20
years and trademarks will be amortized over
15
years. Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and expected synergies to be achieved. The goodwill is
not
deductible for tax purposes. 8 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) The transaction costs associated with the acquisition consisted primarily of legal, regulatory and financial advisory fees, which were expensed as incurred as selling, general and administrative expense. Joint Venture On January 19, 2021, CooperVision acquired all of the remaining equity interests of SGV, a privately-held medical device company that developed spectacle lenses for myopia management. The transaction included potential payments of future consideration that were contingent upon the achievement of the regulatory approval milestone (the regulatory approval payment) and the acquired business reaching certain revenue thresholds over a specified period (the revenue pa yments). The undiscounted range of the contingent consideration was
zero
to $ 139.1  million payable to the other former equity interest owners.
In March 2022, the entities amended the terms of the contingent consideration, which resulted in CooperVision paying $ 42.9  million to the former equity interest owners in exchange for the elimination of the revenue payments. CooperVision recognized a net gain of $ 12.2  million during fiscal 2022. Further, CooperVision and Essilor International SAS (Essilor) executed the Contribution Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreements”) in March 2022. Essilor paid CooperVision $ 52.1  million in exchange for
50 % interest in SGV and their proportionate share of the revenue payments. As part of the Agreements, each party contributed their interest in SGV and $ 10  million in cash to form a new joint venture. CooperVision then remeasured the fair value of its retained equity investment in the joint venture at $ 90.0  million which resulted in a $ 56.9  million gain in Other (income) expense on deconsolidation of SGV in fiscal 2022.
As of January 31, 2023, CooperVision determined that approval would not be achieved within the timeline set forth in the contractual terms of the regulatory approval payment and released the remaining $ 31.8  million contingent consideration liability. Additional information regarding the joint venture is included in our notes to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.

30.7 % and
21.8 %, respectively. The increase was primarily due to changes in the geographic composition of pre-tax earnings, an increase in the UK statutory tax rate from 19% to 25%, and capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for fiscal 2023 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 12. Financial Derivatives and Hedging On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into
six
interest rate swap contracts which were used to hedge its exposure to changes in cash flows associated with its variable rate debt and were designated as derivatives in a cash flow hedge. The payment streams were based on a total notional amount of $ 1.5
billion at the inception of the contracts. As of January 31, 2023,
three
of the
six
interest rate swap contracts have matured and the outstanding contracts have a total notional amount of $ 1.0
billion and remaining maturities of
five years
or less. The Company did not have any cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts as of January 31, 2023.
The interest rate swap contracts are fair valued by netting discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts, which are estimated based on observable market interest rate curves (Level 2). The cumulative pre-tax impact of the gain on derivatives designated for hedge accounting recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was $ 96.7
million ($ 73.4
million, net of tax) as of January 31, 2023, and $ 34.8
million ($ 26.4
million, net of tax) as of
January 31, 2022 . The fair value of derivative instruments are classified in "Other non-current assets" on our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.

Unaudited Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements relating to plans, prospects, goals, strategies, future actions, events or performance and other statements which are other than statements of historical fact, including: statements regarding the expected impacts of global macroeconomic, health and political conditions; and statements regarding acquisitions (including acquired companies' financial positions, our market position based on acquisitions, product development and business strategies, anticipated cost synergies, expected timing and benefits of pending transactions, and integration of acquired entities or operations, as well as estimates of our and the acquired entities' future expenses, sales and earnings per share) that are forward-looking. In addition, all statements regarding anticipated growth in our revenues, anticipated market conditions, planned product launches, restructuring or business transition expectations, regulatory plans, and expected results of operations are forward-looking. To identify these statements, look for words like “believes,” “outlook,” “probable,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or “anticipates” and similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements necessarily depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause our actual results and future actions to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are: • Adverse changes in the global or regional general business, political and economic conditions, including the impact of continuing uncertainty and instability of certain countries, man-made or natural disasters and pandemic conditions, that could adversely affect our global markets, and the potential adverse economic impact and related uncertainty caused by these items. • The impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the global response to this invasion on the global economy, European economy, financial markets, energy markets, currency rates and our ability to supply product to, or through, affected countries. • Foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations including the risk of fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies or interest rates that would decrease our net sales and earnings. • Our existing and future variable rate indebtedness and associated interest expense is impacted by rate increases, which could adversely affect our financial health or limit our ability to borrow additional funds. • Changes in tax laws, examinations by tax authorities, and changes in our geographic composition of income.
• Acquisition-related adverse effects including the failure to successfully achieve the anticipated net sales, margins and earnings benefits of acquisitions, integration delays or costs and the requirement to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period, required regulatory approvals for an acquisition not being obtained or being delayed or subject to conditions that are not anticipated, adverse impacts of changes to accounting controls and reporting procedures, contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations, increased leverage and lack of access to available financing (including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms). • Compliance costs and potential liability in connection with U.S. and foreign laws and health care regulations pertaining to privacy and security of personal information, such as HIPAA and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements in Europe, including but not limited to those resulting from data security breaches. • A major disruption in the operations of our manufacturing, accounting and financial reporting, research and development, distribution facilities or raw material supply chain due to challenges associated with integration of acquisitions, man-made or natural disasters, pandemic conditions, cybersecurity incidents or other causes. • A major disruption in the operations of our manufacturing, accounting and financial reporting, research and development or distribution facilities due to technological problems, including any related to our information systems maintenance, enhancements or new system deployments, integrations or upgrades. • Market consolidation of large customers globally through mergers or acquisitions resulting in a larger proportion or concentration of our business being derived from fewer customers. • Disruptions in supplies of raw materials, particularly components used to manufacture our silicone hydrogel lenses. • New U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws, regulations and enforcement guidance, which affect areas of our operations including, but not limited to, those affecting the health care industry, including the contact lens industry specifically and the medical device or pharmaceutical industries generally, including but not limited to the EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR). 16 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations • Legal costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs and the risk of an adverse decision, prohibitive injunction or settlement related to product liability, patent infringement, contractual disputes, or other litigation. • Limitations on sales following product introductions due to poor market acceptance. • New competitors, product innovations or technologies, including but not limited to, technological advances by competitors, new products and patents attained by competitors, and competitors' expansion through acquisitions. • Reduced sales, loss of customers and costs and expenses related to product recalls and warning letters. • Failure to receive, or delays in receiving, regulatory approvals or certifications for products. • Failure of our customers and end users to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers for our products and services. • The requirement to provide for a significant liability or to write off, or accelerate depreciation on, a significant asset, including goodwill, other intangible assets and idle manufacturing facilities and equipment. • The success of our research and development activities and other start-up projects. • Dilution to earnings per share from acquisitions or issuing stock. • Impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting standards and policies. • Risks related to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability. • Other events described in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the “Business” and “Risk Factors” sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, as such Risk Factors may be updated in quarterly filings including updates made in this filing.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 ended January 31, 2023, and compare them with the same period of fiscal 2022. We also discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” Within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate exactly from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.     Outlook We are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets, and the resilience of and growth prospects for our businesses and products. However, we face significant risks and uncertainties in our global operating environment. These risks include uncertain global and regional business, political and economic conditions, including but not limited to those associated with man-made or natural disasters, pandemic conditions, inflation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, regulatory developments, supply chain disruptions, and escalating global trade barriers. For more information on the risks associated with our global operating environment, refer to Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" herein. These risks and uncertainties have adversely affected our sales, cash flow and performance in the past and are likely to further adversely affect our future sales, cash flow and performance. Global Market and Economic Conditions
- Over the last few years in the U.S. and globally, market and economic conditions have been challenging, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign countries, in particular the Euro zone, have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues. In addition, changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, the war in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely to lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates. In a higher inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the increase in our costs. These market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. CooperVision
- We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric, multifocal, toric multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel Aquaform ®
technology and PC Technology™. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision also competes in the myopia management and specialty eye care contact lens markets with myopia management contact lenses using its ActivControl® technology and with products such as orthokeratology (ortho-k) and scleral lenses. In November 2019, CooperVision received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its MiSight ®
1 day lens, which is the first and only FDA-approved product indicated to slow the progression of myopia in children with treatment initiated between the ages of 8-12 and became available in the United States during fiscal 2020. In August 2021, CooperVision received Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approval for its MiSight ®
1 day lens for use in China. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration using recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions.
Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. CooperVision manufactures and markets a wide variety of silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Our single-use silicone hydrogel product franchises, clariti ®
and MyDay ® , remain a focus as we expect increasing demand for these products, as well as future single-use products, as the global contact lens market continues to shift to this modality. Outside of single-use, the Biofinity ®
and Avaira Vitality ®
product families comprise our focus in the FRP, or frequent replacement product, market which encompasses the monthly and 2-week modalities. Included in this segment are unique products such as Biofinity Energys ® , which helps individuals with digital eye fatigue. CooperSurgical -
Our CooperSurgical business competes in the general health care market with a commitment to advancing the health of women, babies and families through its diversified portfolio of products and services, including medical devices, fertility, genomics, diagnostics, cryostorage, contraception and healthcare technology services (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage and genomic testing). CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model.
On December 17, 2021, CooperSurgical completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in Generate Life Sciences (Generate), a privately held leading provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage (cord blood & cord tissue), and paid an aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $1.663 billion. 18 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Competitive factors in the segments in which CooperSurgical competes include technological and scientific advances, product quality and availability, price and customer service (including response time and effective communication of product information to physicians, consumers, fertility clinics and hospitals). CooperVision Net Sales The contact lens market has two major product categories: • Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects; and • Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

Other Expense (Income), Net Period Ended January 31, Three Months ($ in millions) 2023 2022 Foreign exchange (gain) loss (1.0) 3.3  Other expense (income), net 2.3  (1.0) $ 1.3  $ 2.3  Foreign exchange gain is primarily associated with the relative weakening of the US dollar against foreign currencies and the effect on intercompany receivables during the three months ended January 31, 2023. Other expense (income), net increased in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to loss on minority investments, partially offset by defined benefit plan related income. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 were 30.7% and 21.8%, respectively. The increase was primarily due to changes in the geographic composition of pre-tax earnings, an increase in the UK statutory tax rate from 19% to 25%, and capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for fiscal 2023 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 23 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Working capital on January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, was $661.7 million and $253.4 million, respectively. The increase in working capital was primarily due to repayment of the 364-day term loan during the first three months of fiscal 2023. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements for further information. Cash Flow ($ in millions) January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Operating activities $ 166.6  $ 166.0  Investing activities (113.3) (1,669.3) Financing activities (77.6) 1,693.6  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash 4.2  (3.7) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash held for sale $ (20.1) $ 186.6  Operating Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2023 remains flat compared to the first three months of fiscal 2022, primarily due to net changes in other non-cash items, partially offset by the net cash flow from changes in operating capital and the $31.8 million release of contingent consideration liability associated with SGV's regulatory approval milestone.
Investing Cash Flow Cash used in investing activities in the first three months of fiscal 2023 was lower than cash used in the first three months of fiscal 2022, primarily attributable to $1.6 billion cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the Generate acquisition in the first three months of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions and Joint Venture for further information. Financing Cash Flow Cash used in financing activities in the first three months of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to repayments of $338.0 million on the 2021 364-day term loan, partially offset by $276.5 million of funds drawn on the 2020 revolving credit. Cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to funds received from the 2021 term loan facility ($1.5 billion) and the 2021 364-day term loan facility ($840.0 million), partially offset by $546.1 million repayments of the 2021 revolving credit and $78.5 million repurchases of common stock.
Refer to Note 5. Financing Arrangements for further information. The following is a summary of the maximum commitments and the net amounts available to us under different credit facilities as of January 31, 2023: (In millions) Facility Limit Outstanding Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit Total Amount Available Maturity Date Revolving Credit: 2020 Revolving Credit $ 1,290.0  $ 276.5  $ 1.4  $ 1,012.1  April 1, 2025 Term loan: 2020 Term Loan 850.0  850.0  n/a —  April 1, 2025 2021 Term Loan 1,500.0  1,500.0  n/a —  December 17, 2026 Total $ 3,640.0  $ 2,626.5  $ 1.4  $ 1,012.1  As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements of the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. 24 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Considering recent market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have re-evaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and continue to believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operating activities and cash available under our 2020 Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Share Repurchase In December 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the 2012 Share Repurchase Program and through subsequent amendments, the most recent in March 2017, the total repurchase authorization was increased from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Purchases under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and may be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. As of January 31, 2023, $256.4 million remains authorized for repurchase under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, there was no share repurchase under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program. Dividends We paid a semiannual dividend of approximatel y $1.5 million o r 3 cents per share,
on February 9, 2023, to st ockholders of record o n January 20, 2023. Transition from LIBOR The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA confirmed its intention to stop requiring banks to submit rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. However, for U.S. dollar-denominated (USD) LIBOR, only one-week and two-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published after 2021, and all remaining USD LIBOR tenors will continue being published until June 2023. Further, in March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Effective February 1, 2023, the Company transitioned its credit agreements from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). While the notional value of agreements potentially indexed to LIBOR is material, we do not expect a material impact on our financial statements related to this transition. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Information regarding estimates and critical accounting policies is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our policies from those previously discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Accounting Pronouncements

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. We do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide. As a result, our earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, sales transactions, capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations. Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, principally our British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen denominated debt and receivables denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and from operations in other foreign currencies. We did not have any cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts as of January 31, 2023. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rates on our revolving lines of credit and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and SOFR (and, previously, LIBOR). As of January 31, 2023, we had outstanding debt for an aggregate carrying amount of $2.7 billion. We have entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. Effective February 1, 2023, the interest rate on our credit agreements was converted from LIBOR to SOFR. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time. As an example, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1% or 100 basis points, the quarterly interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.5 million based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements of the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act)) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our first quarter of fiscal 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
