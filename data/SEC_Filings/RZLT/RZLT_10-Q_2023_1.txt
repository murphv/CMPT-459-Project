Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Report”) contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this Report, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements appear in a number of places, including, but not limited to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These statements represent our reasonable judgment of the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “may,” “should,” “plan,” “project” and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following: ● our projected operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows used in operations; ● our expectations regarding capital expenditures, research and development expenses and other payments; ● our expectation about the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) on our business; ● our beliefs and assumptions relating to our liquidity position, including our ability to obtain additional financing; ● our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or the speed of such approvals, for our pharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics; and ● our future dependence on third party manufacturers or strategic partners to manufacture any of our pharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics that receive regulatory approval, and our ability to identify strategic partners and enter into license, co-development, collaboration or similar arrangements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including, but not limited to, the risks described in Part II, Item 1.A Risk Factors, as well as “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on September 15, 2022. In addition, there may be other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the results referenced in the forward-looking statements, some of which are included elsewhere in this Report, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Many of these factors will be important in determining our actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this Report are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report, except as otherwise required by applicable law. ​ ​ ii

Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ NOTE 1 — NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations Rezolute, Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing transformative therapies for metabolic diseases related to chronic glucose imbalance. The Company’s primary clinical assets consist of (i) RZ358, which is a potential treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism, an ultra-rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by excessive production of insulin by the pancreas, and (ii) RZ402, which is an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor (“PKI”) being developed as a potential therapy for the chronic treatment of diabetic macular edema. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial information, and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, has been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K, which contains the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnote disclosures necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. It is management’s opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation have been made. The interim results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the financial condition and results of operations that may be expected for any future interim period or for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Consolidation The Company has
two
wholly owned subsidiaries consisting of Rezolute (Bio) Ireland Limited, and Rezolute Bio UK, Ltd. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company’s significant accounting estimates include, but are not necessarily limited to, the fair value of derivative liabilities, fair value of share-based payments, management’s assessment of going concern, and clinical trial accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s operations may be subject to significant risks and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated with a clinical stage company, including the potential risk of business failure, and the future impact of COVID-19. 7
Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ Significant Accounting Policies The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Standard.   The following standard was adopted during the six months ended December 31, 2022: In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06,
Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity).
ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, which results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 affects the diluted earnings per share calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 allows entities to use a modified or full retrospective transition method. The Company adopted this standard using the full retrospective transition method effective July 1, 2022. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. Standard Required to be Adopted in Future Periods.
The following accounting standard is not yet effective; management has not completed its evaluation to determine the impact that adoption of this standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment model (known as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2019, ASU 2016-13 was amended by ASU 2019-10,
Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842)
whereby the effective date for ASU 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies is now required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon adoption. ​ NOTE 2 — LIQUIDITY The Company is in the clinical stage and has not yet generated any revenues. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 23.4
million and net cash used in operating activities amounted to $ 15.1
million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 41.1
million and net cash used in operating activities amounted to $ 39.6
million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 232.6
million, cash and cash equivalents of $ 146.7
million, and total current liabilities of $ 6.3
million. As discussed in Note 4, the Company is subject to license agreements that provide for future contractual payments upon achievement of various milestone events. Pursuant to the ActiveSite License Agreement (as defined below), a $ 3.0
million milestone payment will be due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial for RZ402. Additionally, pursuant to the XOMA License Agreement (as defined below), a $ 5.0
million milestone payment will be due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial for RZ358.  First patient dosing milestone for the RZ402 Phase 2 clinical trial was triggered in February 2023. First patient dosing milestone RZ358 Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to occur within the next 12 months.

Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ Management believes the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance of $ 146.7
million as of December 31, 2022, will be adequate to meet the Company’s contractual obligations and carry out ongoing clinical trials and other planned activities at least through February 2024. ​ NOTE 3 — OPERATING LEASES In April 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California.  The space consists of approximately
9,300
square feet and provides for total base rent payments of approximately $ 2.9
million through the expected expiration of the lease in November 2027. The landlord was required to make improvements to the facility before the Company could occupy the space. These improvements were completed in October 2022, triggering the commencement of the lease. The lease provides for a
six-month
rent abatement period beginning upon commencement of the lease term. In addition, the lease provides an allowance of approximately $ 0.1
million that may be utilized by the Company for the purchase of furniture and equipment. The average base rent payable in cash over the
60-month
lease term is approximately $ 48,000
per month. Upon commencement of the lease, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset for approximately $ 2.3
million, and a related operating lease liability for approximately $ 2.2
million. ​ The carrying value of all right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ June 30,  ​      2022      2022 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Right-of-use assets ​ $

In January 2019, the XOMA License Agreement was amended with an updated payment schedule, as well as revising the amount the Company was required to expend on development of RZ358 and related licensed products, and revised provisions with respect to the Company’s diligence efforts in conducting clinical studies. In January 2022, the Company was required to make a milestone payment under the XOMA License Agreement of $ 2.0
million that became due upon the dosing of the last patient in the Company’s ongoing Phase 2b Clinical Trial for RZ358.  Upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory events under the XOMA License Agreement, the Company will be required to make additional milestone payments to XOMA up to $ 35.0
million.  After the clinical and regulatory milestones, the Company will be required, upon the future commercialization of RZ358, to pay royalties to XOMA based on the net sales of the related products and additional milestone payments to XOMA up to $ 185.0
million related to annual net sales amounts. The next milestone payment of $ 5.0
million will be due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial for RZ358. ActiveSite License Agreement On August 4, 2017, the Company entered into a Development and License Agreement (the “ActiveSite License Agreement”) with ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ActiveSite”) pursuant to which the Company acquired the rights to ActiveSite’s Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor program (“PKI Portfolio”). The Company is initially using the PKI Portfolio to develop an oral PKI therapeutic for diabetic macular edema (RZ402) and may use the PKI Portfolio to develop other therapeutics for different indications. The ActiveSite License Agreement requires various milestone payments up to $ 46.5
million, if all milestones are achieved. The first milestone payment for $ 1.0
million was paid in December 2020 after clearance was received for an Initial Drug Application, or IND, filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The next milestone payment of $ 3.0
million will be due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial for RZ402. The company is also required to pay royalties equal to
2.0 % of any sales of products that use the PKI Portfolio. There have been no events that would result in any royalty payments owed under the ActiveSite License Agreement to date. ​ 10
Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ NOTE 5 — EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILTY
On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into a $ 30.0
million Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with SLR Investment Corp. and certain other lenders (the “Lenders”). The Lenders agreed to loan up to $ 30.0
million in
three
tranches consisting of (i) a $ 15.0
million term A loan that was funded on April 14, 2021, (ii) term B and term C loans for an aggregate of $ 15.0
million, which were subject to the Company’s ability to obtain prescribed amounts of financing and the achievement of certain clinical milestones. The Company did not achieve the initial clinical milestones by January 2022 and, accordingly, the term B and term C loans were no longer a source of liquidity. The term A loan had a maturity date of April 1, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”), but was repaid in full on June 30, 2022. Concurrently with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company entered into an exit fee agreement (the “Exit Fee Agreement”) that provides for a fee of
4.00 % of the funded principal balance of each term loan in the event certain transactions (defined as “Exit Events”) occur prior to April 13, 2031. Exit Events include, but are not limited to, sales of substantially all assets, certain mergers, change of control transactions, and issuances of common stock that result in new investors owning more than
35 % of the Company’s shares. As of April 14, 2021, the Company allocated a portion of the proceeds from the term A loan to recognize a liability for the fair value of embedded derivatives. Fair value was determined primarily based on the Company’s strategic corporate development plans and management has performed a detailed evaluation of the different types of Exit Events that could occur and using a discounted rate equivalent to the effective rate for the term A loan. Fair value of embedded derivatives is assessed at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized as a nonoperating gain or loss.

Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ ​ July 2022 Financing In May 2022, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (“SPAs”) with Handok, Inc. (“Handok”) and certain of its affiliates.  Handok is an affiliate of a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. In July 2022, the Company entered into amended SPAs for a private placement of common stock (the “2022 Private Placement”).   The 2022 Private Placement resulted in gross proceeds of $ 12.3
million in exchange for the issuance of approximately
3.2
million shares of common stock.  The Company incurred approximately $ 0.8
million for underwriting commissions and other offering costs, resulting in net proceeds of $ 11.5
million. Underwritten Public Offering ​ On October 12, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., as representative of the underwriters listed therein (the “Underwriters”) for the planned issuance and sale of equity securities in an underwritten public offering (the “Underwritten Offering”). On October 15, 2021, closing occurred for the Underwritten Offering resulting in the issuance of (i)
6,030,847
shares of common stock at $ 6.50
per share for gross proceeds of $ 39.2
million, and (ii)  1,661,461
pre-funded warrants to purchase
1,661,461
shares of common stock at an issuance price of $ 6.49
per warrant (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) for gross proceeds of $ 10.8
million. The aggregate gross proceeds from the Underwritten Offering amounted to $ 50.0
million, excluding the exercise of the Underwriters’ Option discussed below, and before deductions for underwriting discounts and commissions of
6.0 % of the gross proceeds and other offering costs of approximately $ 0.3
million. After deducting total offering costs of $ 3.3
million, the net proceeds of the Underwritten Offering amounted to approximately $ 46.7
million.
​ In connection with the Underwritten Offering, the Company granted the Underwriters a
30-day
option to purchase up to an additional
1,153,845
shares of its common stock in the Underwritten Offering at a public offering price of $ 6.50
per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions (the “Underwriters’ Option”). In November 2021, the Underwriters’ Option was partially exercised for
116,266
shares resulting in additional gross proceeds of approximately $ 0.8
million. ​ Pre-Funded Warrants ​ The Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the Underwritten Offering have an exercise price of $ 0.01
per share, which is subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock. Each Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time after issuance with no stated expiration date. In the event of certain corporate transactions, the holders of the Pre-Funded Warrants will be entitled to receive, upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Pre-Funded Warrants immediately prior to such transaction. The Pre-Funded Warrants do not entitle the holders thereof to any voting rights or any of the other rights or privileges to which holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled.
​ The gross proceeds of $ 10.8
million received from issuance of the Pre-Funded Warrants was recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity within additional paid-in capital. In accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of the outstanding warrants are not entitled to exercise any portion of the Pre-Funded Warrant if, upon exercise of such portion of the warrant, the holder’s aggregate ownership of the Company’s common stock or the combined voting power beneficially owned by such holder would exceed a designated percentage elected by the holder ranging from
4.99 % to
19.99 %, after giving effect to the exercise (the “Maximum Ownership Percentage”). Upon at least
61 days ’ prior notice to the Company, any warrant holder may elect to increase or decrease the Maximum Ownership Percentage to any other percentage not to exceed  19.99 %. As of December 31, 2022,  no  shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised. ​ 12
Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ Registered Direct Offering ​ Concurrently with the Underwritten Offering, a major shareholder (the “Purchaser”) that is affiliated with a member of our Board of Directors entered into a subscription agreement for a registered direct offering, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Purchaser an aggregate of
769,231
shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $ 6.50
per share. The closing for the registered direct offering occurred on October 27, 2021, whereby the Company received gross proceeds of $ 5.0
million. Equity Distribution Agreement In December 2020, the Company and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (the “Agent”) entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “EDA”) that provides for an “at the market offering” for the sale of up to $ 50.0
million in shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Placement Shares”) through the Agent. The Agent was acting as sales agent and was required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell all of the Placement Shares requested to be sold by the Company, consistent with the Agent’s normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the Agent and the Company. The EDA was scheduled to terminate when all of the Placement Shares had been sold, or earlier upon the election of either the Company or the Agent. In May 2022, the Company provided the Agent with notice of termination of the EDA and no further shares will be issued under this agreement. Under the terms of the EDA, the Company agreed to pay the Agent a commission equal to
3.0 % of the gross sales price of the Placement Shares plus certain expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the offering. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold
138,388
shares of its common stock pursuant to the EDA for net proceeds of approximately $ 1.5
million. LPC Purchase Agreement
In August 2021, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “RRA”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“LPC”), which provides that the Company may sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $ 20.0
million shares (the “Purchase Shares”) of its common stock. The Company concurrently filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC to register the shares issuable under the Purchase Agreement. The aggregate number of shares that the Company could sell to LPC under the Purchase Agreement was
1,669,620
shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. LPC’s initial purchase consisted of
95,708
Purchase Shares at a purchase price of approximately $ 10.45
per share for a total purchase price of $ 1.0
million. Concurrently, the Company issued
33,799
shares of common stock to LPC as an initial fee for its commitment to purchase shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company had the right, in its sole discretion, to present LPC with a purchase notice (a “Regular Purchase Notice”), directing LPC to purchase up to
25,000
Purchase Shares (a “Regular Purchase”). LPC’s committed obligation under any single Regular Purchase generally could not exceed $ 2.0
million. The Purchase Agreement provided for a purchase price per share for each Regular Purchase (the “Purchase Price”) equal to the lesser of (i) the lowest sale price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NCM”) on the purchase date of such shares; and (ii) the average of the
three
lowest closing sale prices for the common stock traded on the NCM during the
ten
consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately preceding the purchase date of such shares. On September 17, 2021, the Company submitted a Regular Purchase Notice, resulting in the sale of
20,000
Purchase Shares to LPC for net proceeds of approximately $ 0.2
million. In May 2022, the Company provided LPC with notice of termination of the Purchase Agreement whereby no further shares are issuable under this agreement. ​ ​ 13

Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ NOTE 10 — INCOME TAXES Income tax expense during interim periods is based on applying an estimated annualized effective income tax rate applied to the respective quarterly periods, adjusted for discrete tax items in the period in which they occur. The computation of the annualized estimated effective tax rate for each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the expected operating results for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in various jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information becomes known or as the tax environment changes. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any income tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. The Company did not have any material changes to its conclusions regarding valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets or uncertain tax positions for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ NOTE 11 — NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares, 2021 PFWs and 2022 PFWs outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. PFWs are included in the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share since the exercise price is negligible and all of the PFWs are fully vested and exercisable.

Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ NOTE 12 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. Level 2—Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company’s embedded derivative liabilities are classified under Level 3 of the hierarchy and are required to be measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is determined based on management’s assessment of the probability and timing of occurrence for the Exit Events discussed in Note 5 using a discount rate equal to the effective interest rate for the term A loan.
The following table sets forth changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022   2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair value, beginning of period ​ $
407 ​ $
387 Loss (gain) from change in fair value ​ ​
26 ​ ​
( 4 ) Fair value, end of period ​ $
433 ​ $
383 ​ Except for embedded derivative liabilities, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximated their carrying values as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company’s policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 as of the actual date of the events or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any transfers of its assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. Significant Concentrations Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at high-quality financial institutions. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash deposits have exceeded the amount of federal insurance provided on such deposits.
​ 18
Table of Contents Rezolute, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ​ As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents consisting of $ 115.1

The amendments provide that if either of the Executive Officers are terminated outside of a change in control event and without cause, (i) all of their stock options that are subject to ongoing vesting conditions over subsequent periods ranging from
12
to
18 months
will immediately vest, and (ii) such stock options will remain exercisable for periods ranging from
6
to
12 months
following the occurrence of the termination event. In addition, if either of the Executive Officers are terminated solely due to a change of control event, all of their unvested stock options will immediately vest and all outstanding stock options will remain exercisable for periods ranging from
6
to
12 months
following the occurrence of the termination event.
​ The amendment to the chief medical officer’s employment agreement provides that upon the occurrence of a termination event other than a change of control, the Company is required to (i) make severance payments equal to
12 months
of salary, a pro-rata bonus, and health insurance coverage for
12 months
following the termination date, and (ii) all unvested stock options subject to vest over the subsequent
12 month
period after the termination event will become immediately exercisable and all outstanding stock options will remain exercisable for
6 months
following the termination event. In addition, upon the occurrence of a termination solely due to a change of control event, the Company is required to (i) make severance payments equal to
18 months
of salary, a pro-rata bonus, and health insurance coverage for
18 months
following the termination event. ​ ActiveSite Milestone Payment ​ Pursuant to the ActiveSite License Agreement discussed in Note 4, the next scheduled milestone payment for $ 3.0
million is due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical study.
On February 6, 2023, the Company dosed the first patient in its Phase 2 study, triggering the obligation to pay this milestone payment in February 2023.
The Company will recognize the related licensing expense in the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023. ​ ​ ​ 19
Table of Contents ​ ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Certain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding. As used in the discussion below, “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refers to Rezolute, Inc. Special Note Regarding Status of Clinical Assets RZ358 ​ Our lead clinical asset, RZ358, is a potential treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism, an ultra-rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by excessive production of insulin by the pancreas. We initiated the RZ358-606 Phase 2b study (“RIZE”) globally at multiple study centers in the first quarter of 2020. Following delays in patient dosing as a result of COVID-19, we advanced the study in second half of 2021 and completed patient dosing in the first half of 2022. As a result of the open label nature of RIZE, we were able to announce topline results from the study at the Pediatric Endocrine Society Meeting in May 2022. Following that announcement and a subsequent three-month safety follow-up with the final patients in the study, the study database was locked in the third quarter of 2022. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2022 and continuing into the first quarter of 2023, we are finalizing tables, figures and listings (“TFL”) for the study as well as clinical study reports (“CSRs”). In the second half of 2022, we also began interacting with the FDA and European regulatory authorities regarding our initial plans for an anticipated Phase 3 study in 2023. We plan to interact with both the European regulatory authorities and the FDA in the first half of 2023 with the goal of establishing alignment regarding Phase 3 study design including endpoints for the study, duration of treatment for the patients in the study, as well as the ages of patients to be enrolled. Following these interactions, we anticipate commencing Phase 3 during the Summer of 2023. Based on our current enrollment estimates, we plan to have top line results available from this study in the first quarter of 2025. ​ ​ RZ402 ​ Our second clinical asset, RZ402, is a selective and potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor (“PKI”) being developed as a potential oral therapy for the chronic treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”). We conducted two Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers for RZ402 in 2021 and 2022 to assess the safety and pharmacological profile of the drug. We announced positive topline results from these studies which demonstrated that oral administration of RZ402 resulted in plasma concentrations that substantially exceeded target pharmacologically active drug levels, demonstrating the potential for once daily dosing. RZ402 was generally safe and well-tolerated at all doses tested, without dose-limiting toxicities. Notably, the second Phase 1 study was a multiple-ascending dose (“MAD”) study that showed dose-dependent increases in systemic exposures, with repeat-dosing to steady-state resulting in the highest concentrations of RZ402 explored to date, exceeding 200 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL at peak and 24-hour trough, respectively. The MAD study results showed that RZ402 was generally safe and well-tolerated, including at higher doses than previously tested in the first single ascending dose study. There were no serious adverse events, adverse drug reactions or identified risks in either study.
In December 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of RZ402 administered as a monotherapy over a 12-week treatment period in participants with DME who are naïve to, or have received limited anti-VEGF injections. The study population will include DME patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Eligible participants will be randomized equally, to one of three RZ402 active treatment arms at doses of 50, 200, and 400 mg, or a placebo control arm, and will receive study drug once daily for 12 weeks, before completing a four-week follow-up. The study is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients overall, across approximately 25 investigational sites in the United States. The principal endpoints of the trial include (i) changes in central subfield thickness on the macula (“CST”), as measured by Spectral Domain Ocular Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), (ii) changes in visual acuity as measured by the early treatment diabetic retinopathy scale (“ETDRS”), (iii) the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of RZ402 in patients with DME, and (iv) the safety and tolerability of RZ402. We expect to complete dosing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and to announce results from the study in the first quarter of 2024. 20
Table of Contents ​ Recent Developments Headquarters Lease In April 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters facility in Redwood City, California.  The space consists of approximately 9,300 square feet and provides for total base rent payments of approximately $2.9 million through the expected expiration of the lease in November 2027. The lease provides for a six-month rent abatement period that began upon commencement of the lease term which occurred in October 2022 Financing Activities In July 2022, we entered into amended securities purchase agreements with Handok, Inc. (“Handok”) and certain of its affiliates (the “2022 Private Placement”), resulting in gross proceeds of $12.3 million in exchange for the issuance of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock.  We incurred approximately $0.8 million for underwriting commissions and other offering costs, resulting in net proceeds of $11.5 million. Termination of Loan Agreement On April 14, 2021, we entered into a $30.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Solar Investment Corp. (“SLR”) as collateral agent, and the parties signing the Loan Agreement from time to time as lenders, including SLR in its capacity as a lender. The scheduled maturity date of the Loan Agreement was on April 1, 2026. In April 2021, we borrowed $15.0 million under the Loan Agreement. On June 30, 2022, we paid off the outstanding loan amount of $15.0 million in full and terminated the Loan Agreement in accordance with its terms. Please refer to our discussion under the caption  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for further discussion of our recent financing activities. Factors Impacting our Results of Operations We have not generated any meaningful revenues since our inception in March 2010. Over the last several years, we have conducted private placements and public offerings to raise additional capital, adopted a licensing model to pursue development of product candidates, conducted pre-clinical and clinical trials, and conducted other research and development activities on our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the time required to conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we anticipate it will be several years before we generate substantial revenues, if ever. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future; therefore, we expect to continue efforts to raise additional capital to maintain our current operating plans over the next several years. We cannot assure you that we will secure such financing or that it will be adequate for the long-term execution of our business strategy. Even if we obtain additional financing, it may be costly and may require us to agree to covenants or other provisions that will favor new investors over our existing shareholders.
Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations Research and development expenses.  Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our personnel engaged in R&D activities, clinical trial costs, licensing costs, and consulting and outside services. Our R&D compensation costs include an allocable portion of our cash and share-based compensation, employee benefits, and consulting costs related to personnel engaged in the design and development of product candidates and other scientific research projects. We also allocate a portion of our facilities and overhead costs based on the personnel and other resources devoted to R&D activities. General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of (i) an allocable portion of our cash and share-based compensation and employee benefits related to personnel engaged in our administrative, finance, accounting, and executive functions, and (ii) an allocable portion of our facilities and overhead costs related to such personnel. G&A expenses also include travel, legal, auditing, consulting, investor relations and other costs primarily related to our status as a public company. 21
Table of Contents Interest and other income.
Interest and other income consist primarily of interest income earned on temporary cash investments. Gain (loss) from change in fair value of derivative liabilities.
We recognized liabilities for financial instruments that are required to be accounted for as derivatives, as well as embedded derivatives in our debt agreements. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period until the contracts are settled, expire, or otherwise meet the conditions for equity classification. Changes in fair value are reflected as a gain or loss in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Employee retention credit.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States government has designed programs to assist businesses in dealing with the financial hardships caused by the pandemic. We recognize the right to receive governmental assistance payments in the period in which the related conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Interest expense.  The components of interest expense include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated interest rate, and accretion of debt discounts and issuance costs (“DDIC”) using the effective interest method. DDIC arises from the issuance of debt instruments and other related contracts or agreements which possess certain terms and conditions resulting in additional financing costs arising from origination, exit and final fees, and other incremental and direct costs incurred to consummate the financing. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Overview The discussion herein is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. With respect to our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Complex Financings In order to account for complex financing transactions, we are required to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates to determine the appropriate amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. These financing transactions typically involve entering into several distinct legal agreements, whereby we are required to identify and account for each freestanding financial instrument separately. The freestanding financial instruments may be classified as debt, temporary equity or permanent equity instruments depending on the results of our evaluation. In addition, we evaluate if any of the financial instruments contain embedded features that are required to be accounted for as derivatives at fair value. Each freestanding financial instrument is required to be recognized at fair value on the closing date of the financing. The fair value of warrants is generally determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) valuation model and the fair value of common stock is based on the trading price of our shares on the closing date. For financial instruments classified as debt, a discount is recognized if the stated principal balance exceeds the initial allocation of fair value as of the closing date. This discount is accreted to interest expense using the interest method that results in recognition of interest expense at a fixed rate through the expected maturity date. Share-Based Compensation Expense We measure the fair value of services received in exchange for all stock options granted based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We compute the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting using the BSM option-pricing model and recognize the
22
Table of Contents cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn the award. For awards that contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award. We recognize the impact of forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs, rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected to vest in accounting for share-based compensation. For stock options that are voluntarily surrendered by employees, all unrecognized compensation is immediately recognized in the period the options are cancelled. Research and Development R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets related to in-licensing costs under license agreements with third parties are charged to expense unless we are able to determine that the licensing rights have an alternative future use in other R&D projects or otherwise. Clinical Trial Accruals Clinical trial costs are a component of R&D expenses. We accrue and recognize expenses for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites. We determine the estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future R&D activities, are deferred and recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are delivered, or services are performed. Results of Operations Three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue.
As a clinical stage company, we did not generate any revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We are at an early stage of development and do not currently have any commercial products. Our existing product candidates will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they generate any revenues. We do not expect to be able to generate revenue from any of our product candidates for several years. Research and development expenses.
R&D expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ Increase   ​      2022      2021      ​ Amount      Percent   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total R&D expenses ​ $

1,493
16 % ​ The increase in R&D expenses of $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to compensation and benefits for our R&D workforce that increased by approximately $1.6 million. Cash-based compensation and benefits increased by approximately $1.2 million that was primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of R&D employees from 23 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 35 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Share-based compensation and benefits increased by approximately $0.4 million attributable to an increase in share-based compensation related to stock options granted in June 2022 where expense is recognized over the respective vesting periods.  The increases in compensation were partially offset by a net decrease of clinical trial expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022.   Clinical trial costs decreased by $0.1 million due to $0.7 million in reduced spending on RZ358 as the Phase 2b study has concluded, offset by $0.6 million of increased spending for RZ402 program related costs, primarily for Phase 2 readiness clinical costs that resulted in the initiation of a Phase 2 study in December 2022.   23

28 % ​ The increase in G&A expenses of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to increases in (i) share-based compensation expense of $0.4 million due to stock options granted in June 2022 where expense is recognized over the respective vesting periods, and (ii) cash-based compensation expense of $0.4 million due to an increase in the average number of employees from 8 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 13 employees for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest and Other Income . Interest and other income amounted to $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $13,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in excess of $100 million in cash balances held in interest bearing accounts, and (ii) an increase in interest rates for such temporary cash investments. The large increase in cash balances was attributable to the completion of equity financings from October 2021, May 2022 and July 2022. Interest Expense.
We did not incur any interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022, whereas we incurred $0.4 million of interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was solely attributable to the Loan Agreement and consisted of (i) interest expense of $0.3 million based on the weighted average contractual rate of 9.0%, and (ii) accretion of discount of $0.1 million. The Loan Agreement was repaid on June 30, 2022. Income Taxes.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any income tax benefit due to our net losses, and our determination that a valuation allowance was required for all of our deferred tax assets. Six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue.
As a clinical stage company, we did not generate any revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We are at an early stage of development and do not currently have any commercial products. Our existing product candidates will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they generate any revenues.

22 % ​ The increase in R&D expenses of $3.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to compensation and benefits for our R&D workforce that increased by approximately $2.9 million. Cash-based compensation and benefits increased by approximately $2.0 million which was primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of R&D employees from 23 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 35 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.  In addition, approximately $0.9 million of this increase was attributable to an increase in share-based compensation related to stock options granted in June 2022 where expense is recognized over the respective vesting periods. In addition to the increases in compensation and benefits, an increase of $0.5 million was due to higher spending for RZ358 Phase 3 readiness manufacturing costs and RZ402 Phase 2 clinical trial costs.

The increase in interest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) an increase in excess of $100 million in cash balances held in interest bearing accounts, and (ii) an increase in interest rates for such temporary cash investments. The large increase in cash balances was attributable to the completion of equity financings from October 2021, May 2022 and July 2022. Employee Retention Credit.
We did not generate any employee retention credit income for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The income in the prior year was a result of CARES Act benefits. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, governmental assistance was not available under the CARES Act. Interest Expense.
We did not incur any interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 due to the repayment of the Loan Agreement on June 30, 2022, whereas we incurred $0.9 million of interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was solely attributable to the Loan Agreement and consisted of (i) interest expense of $0.7 million based on the weighted average contractual rate of 9.0%, and (ii) accretion of discount of $0.2 million. Income Taxes.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any income tax benefit due to our net losses, and our determination that a valuation allowance was required for all of our deferred tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Short-term Liquidity Requirements As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $146.7 million and working capital was approximately $141.3 million. We have incurred cumulative net losses of $232.6 million since our inception and as a clinical stage company we have not generated any meaningful revenue to date. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been from the completion of private placements and public offerings of our equity securities, as well as proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, as discussed above under the caption
Recent Developments,
we issued common stock in the 2022 Private Placement that resulted in net proceeds of $11.6 million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we received net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities of $165.2 million. The completion of these equity financings is the primary factor that resulted in our cash and cash equivalents balance of $146.7 million as of December 31, 2022. For further information about the key terms and results of our debt and equity financing activities, please refer to the discussion below under the captions  2022 Registered Direct Offering ,
2021 Underwritten Public Offering
and  2021 Registered Direct Offering . Our most significant contractual obligations consist of milestone payments pursuant to licensing agreements with XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”) and ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ActiveSite”) discussed below. Based on our expectations for the dates when certain clinical and regulatory milestones will be achieved, we anticipate that $5.0 million will be payable to XOMA within the next twelve
25
Table of Contents months.  In February 2023, $3.0 million became payable to ActiveSite upon the dosing of the first patient in the Company’s phase 2 clinical study.
Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of $146.7 million as of December 31, 2022, we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet all of our contractual obligations and conduct all planned activities to advance our clinical trials during through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023. Long-term Liquidity Requirements Our most significant long-term contractual obligations consist of clinical and regulatory milestone payments up to $35.0 million payable to XOMA and up to $32.5 million in milestones payable to ActiveSite, for a total of $67.5 million. As discussed above, we expect that $5.0 million will be payable to XOMA within the next twelve months and $3.0 million became payable to ActiveSite in February 2023. Accordingly, the remainder of $72.5 million is considered a long-term liquidity requirement. Our current expectations are that we will incur additional milestone payments of $5.0 million payable to XOMA for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing associated with clinical trial activities and regulatory approvals, there is even greater uncertainty in forecasting the milestone payments to XOMA and ActiveSite during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 and thereafter.
Our long-term contractual obligations also include (i) operating lease payments up to approximately $0.7 million per year through calendar year 2027, and (ii) an exit fee of $0.6 million if we enter into certain transactions (defined as “Exit Events”) prior to April 13, 2031. Exit Events include, but are not limited to, sales of substantially all assets, certain mergers, change of control transactions, and issuances of common stock that result in new investors owning more than 35% of the Company’s shares. As discussed above under the caption
Recent Developments , on June 30, 2022 we terminated the Loan Agreement with SLR. However, we remain contingently obligated to pay the $0.6 million exit fee. The following discussion provides additional information about the ongoing requirements pursuant to our license agreements with XOMA and ActiveSite, along with additional information about our recent financing activities that impacted our liquidity and capital resources through December 31, 2022. XOMA License Agreement In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “XOMA License Agreement”) with XOMA through its wholly-owned subsidiary, XOMA (US) LLC, pursuant to which XOMA granted an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize XOMA 358 (formerly X358, now RZ358) for all indications. In January 2019, the XOMA License Agreement was amended with an updated payment schedule, as well as revised the amount we were required to expend on development of RZ358 and related licensed products, and revised provisions with respect to our diligence efforts in conducting clinical studies. Upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory events, we will be required to make up to $35.0 million in aggregate milestone payments to XOMA. The first such milestone payment of $2.0 million was triggered upon dosing of the last patient in our ongoing phase 2 clinical study in January 2022. The next milestone payment of $5.0 million will be due upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 study, which we believe will occur in the next twelve months. Additionally, upon the future commercialization of RZ358, we will be required to pay royalties to XOMA based on the net sales of the related products, and milestone payments up to an additional $185.0 million if future annual sales related to RZ358 exceed targets ranging from $100.0 million to $1.0 billion. Through December 31, 2022, no events have occurred that would result in the requirement to make additional milestone payments and no royalties have been incurred. ActiveSite License Agreement In August 2017, we entered into a Development and License Agreement with ActiveSite (“ActiveSite License Agreement”) pursuant to which we acquired the rights to ActiveSite’s plasma kallikrein inhibitor portfolio (the “PKI Program”). We are planning to use the PKI Program to develop, file, manufacture, market and sell products for diabetic macular edema and other therapeutic indications. The ActiveSite License Agreement requires various milestone payments ranging from $1.0 million to $10.0 million when milestone events occur, up to an aggregate of $46.5 million of aggregate milestone payments. The first milestone payment for $1.0 million paid in December 2020 after completion of the preclinical work and submission of an IND to the FDA for RZ402. The next milestone payment for $3.0 million became due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 study in February 2023.  We will also be required to pay
26
Table of Contents royalties equal to 2.0% of any sales of products that use the PKI Program. Through December 31, 2022, no events have occurred that would result in the requirement to make additional milestone payments and no royalties have been incurred. 2022 Registered Direct Offering
On May 1, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, as representative of the underwriters listed therein, relating to the issuance and sale of equity securities in an underwritten registered direct offering (the “2022 RDO”). The 2022 RDO resulted in the issuance of (i) approximately 18.0 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $3.80 per share, (ii) Class A pre-funded warrants (the “Class A PFWs”) to purchase up to 2.0 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.799 per Class A PFW, and (iii) Class B pre-funded warrants (the “Class B PFWs”) to purchase up to 10.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.799 per Class B PFW. On May 4, 2022, the 2022 RDO closed resulting in net proceeds of approximately $110.1 million. The gross amount of the 2022 RDO was $117.6 million, before deduction of an aggregate of $7.1 million for underwriting discounts and approximately $0.4 million for professional fees and other offering expenses payable by us. We believe the additional funding from the 2022 RDO along with the funding received in July 2022 from the 2022 Private Placement provides us with sufficient cash to fund a Phase 3 clinical program for RZ358, as well as a Phase 2 proof of concept study for RZ402. ​ 2021 Underwritten Public Offering and Registered Direct Offering In October 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., as representative of the underwriters listed therein (the “2021 Underwriters”) for the planned issuance and sale of equity securities in an underwritten public offering (the “2021 Underwritten Offering”). On October 15, 2021, closing occurred for the 2021 Underwritten Offering resulting in the issuance of (i) 6,030,847 shares of common stock at $6.50 per share for gross proceeds of $39.2 million, and (ii) 1,661,461 pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,661,461 shares of common stock at an issuance price of $6.49 per warrant (the “2021 PFWs”) for gross proceeds of $10.8 million. The Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,153,845 shares of its common stock in the 2021 Underwritten Offering at a public offering price of $6.50 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions (the “Underwriters’ Option”). In November 2021, the Underwriters’ Option was partially exercised for 116,266 shares resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $0.8 million. The aggregate gross proceeds from the 2021 Underwritten Offering amounted to $50.7 million, excluding the Underwriters’ Option, and before deductions for underwriting commissions of 6.0% of the gross proceeds and other offering costs of approximately $0.3 million. After deducting total offering costs of $3.3 million, the net proceeds of the 2021 Underwritten Offering amounted to approximately $47.2 million. Concurrently with the 2021 Underwritten Offering, Handok, an entity affiliated with a member of the Board of Directors, entered into a subscription agreement for a registered direct offering (the “2021 RDO”) pursuant to which we agreed to sell to the Handok an aggregate of 769,231 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $6.50 per share. The closing for the 2021 RDO occurred on October 27, 2021, whereby we received gross proceeds of $5.0 million. EDA and LPC Financings In December 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “EDA”) with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. as sales agent that provided for an “at the market offering” for the sale of up to $50.0 million in shares of our common stock (the “Placement Shares”). For the six months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 138,388 Placement Shares for which aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.5 million were received. In August 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “LPC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“LPC”), that provided for issuances up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of shares of our common stock (the “Purchase Shares”). For the three months ended December 31, 2021, LPC purchased 115,708 shares of our common stock and we received net proceeds of $1.2 million. In May 2022, we terminated the EDA and the LPC Purchase Agreement whereby no further equity securities are issuable under these agreements. Loan Agreement In April 2021, we borrowed $15.0 million under the Loan Agreement discussed above under the caption Recent Developments. Outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement provided for interest at a floating rate equal to (a) 8.75% per annum plus (b) the greater of (i) the rate per annum published by the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. for a term of one month

Table of Contents and (ii) 0.12% per annum. On June 30, 2022, we paid off the outstanding loan amount of $15.0 million and terminated the Loan Agreement in accordance with its terms. In addition to the repayment of principal and accrued interest, we paid (i) a prepayment fee equal to 2.00% of the outstanding principal balance for a total of $300,000, and (ii) a final fee equal to 4.75% of the aggregate amount of the term loans funded for a total of $712,500. The terminated Loan Agreement was secured by substantially all of our assets. The security interests and liens granted in connection with the terminated Loan Agreement were released on June 30, 2022.

Results of Operations
above. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our non-cash expenses of $3.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, were primarily attributable to share-based compensation expense, accretion of debt discount and issuance costs, and non-cash lease expense. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flow by $4.6 million, primarily driven by an increase of $3.8 million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities primarily due to $2.2 million of accrued compensation related to 2022 calendar year performance bonuses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.8 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flow by $4.7 million, primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable of $3.3 million, an increase in other accrued liabilities of $1.1 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.3 million Cash Provided by Investing Activities For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net cash utilized in investing activities amounted to $153,000, related to the purchase of furniture and equipment primarily for use in our new office location in Redwood City, California.  We did not have any cash flows from investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021. 28
Table of Contents Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $11.6 million. This amount consisted of proceeds of $12.3 million from the 2022 Private Placement.

This amount consisted of proceeds of (i) $50.7 million from the Underwritten Offering, (ii) $5.0 million from the Registered Direct Offering, (iii) $1.5 million from the EDA, and (iv) $1.2 million from the Purchase Agreement. The total proceeds from equity financing activities of $58.4 million were partially offset by payments of $3.4 million for underwriting discounts and other costs related to equity offerings, and $0.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet transactions for the periods covered by this Report. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive and financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on that assessment under those criteria, our management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to a material weakness in the system of internal control. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. The material weakness identified by management is primarily that due to our limited number of employees, we have not adequately segregated certain duties to prevent employees from overriding the internal control system. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we implemented a more robust accounting software that is expected to result in stronger controls. In October 2022, we hired additional personnel, which will enable us to better segregate many functions. We cannot provide assurance that these or other measures will eventually result in the elimination of the material weakness described above. Changes in internal controls over financial reporting During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ 29
Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. None ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our risk factors are set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K (referred to as our “Legacy Risk Factor Disclosures”). As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes with respect to Legacy Risk Factor Disclosures. ​ You should carefully consider the Legacy Risk Factor Disclosures in addition to the other information set forth in this Report and in our 2022 Form 10-K, including the

sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. The Legacy Risk Factor Disclosures are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. ​ ​ Item 2.
