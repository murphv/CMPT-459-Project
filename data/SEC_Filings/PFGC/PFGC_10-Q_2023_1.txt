SPECIAL NOTE REGARDI NG FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”) may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-Q, including statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, beliefs, business strategies, future events, business conditions, our results of operations, financial position, our business outlook, business trends and other information are forward-looking statements. Words such as “estimates,” “expects,” “contemplates,” “will,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “may,” “should” and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon our current expectations, beliefs, estimates, projections, and various assumptions, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Our expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections will result or be achieved, and actual results may vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements.
There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A.
Risk Factors
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”), as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under Part II, Item 1A,
Risk Factors

We caution you that the risks, uncertainties and other factors referenced above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. We cannot assure you (i) we have correctly measured or identified all of the factors affecting our business or the extent of these factors’ likely impact, (ii) the available information with respect to these factors on which such analysis is based is complete or accurate, (iii) such analysis is correct, or (iv) our strategy, which is based in part on this analysis, will be successful.

PERFORMANCE FOOD GROUP COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Summary of Business Activities Business Overview Performance Food Group Company, through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes primarily national and company-branded food and food-related products to customer locations across North America. The Company serves both of the major customer types in the restaurant industry: (i) independent customers, and (ii) multi-unit, or “Chain” customers, which include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains, as well as schools, business and industry locations, healthcare facilities, and retail establishments. The Company also specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, health and beauty care products and other items to vending distributors, big box retailers, theaters, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, travel providers, and hospitality providers.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates   Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, with the exception of the July 2, 2022 consolidated balance sheet, which was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. The financial statements include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates used by management are related to the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for inventories, impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets, acquisition accounting, reserves for claims and recoveries under insurance programs, vendor rebates and other promotional incentives, bonus accruals, depreciation, amortization, determination of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, leases, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. Certain footnote disclosures included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted herein pursuant to applicable rules and regulations for interim financial statements.
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-10,
Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . The update increases the transparency in financial reporting of government assistance by requiring the disclosure of the types of transactions, an entity’s accounting for the transactions and the effect of those transactions on an entity’ s financial statements. This pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company
adopted
the new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2023. The amendments in this update have been applied using the prospective approach to all applicable transactions at the date of initial application and as new transactions occur. The Company determined that adoption of this update has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The update improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with
11
customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payments terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The guidance requires that an acquiring entity in a business combination recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contract. This pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its future consolidated financial statements, but does not expect it to have a material impact. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04,
Liabilities— Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . The update enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring the disclosure of the effect of those programs on an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. The guidance requires disclosure of the key terms of supplier finance programs as well as the obligation amount outstanding as of the end of the period, a description of where the obligation is presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligations balance during the period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amount of obligations paid. This pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. The Company has completed a preliminary analysis of this ASU and determined that it is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
4. Revenue Recognition   The Company markets and distributes primarily national and Company-branded food and food-related products to customer locations across the United States and Canada. The Foodservice segment primarily services restaurants and supplies a “broad line” of products to its customers, including the Company’s Performance Brands and custom-cut meats and seafood, as well as products that are specific to each customer’s menu requirements. Vistar specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. The Convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products, and other items to convenience stores across North America. The Company disaggregates revenue by customer type and product offerings and determined that disaggregating revenue at the segment level achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Refer to Note 13.
Segment Information
for external revenue by reportable segment. The Company has customer contracts in which incentives are paid upfront to certain customers. These payments have become industry practice and are not related to financing the customer’s business, nor are they associated with any distinct good or service to be received from the customer. These incentive payments are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract or the expected life of the customer relationship on a straight-line basis. The Company’s contract asset for these incentives totaled
$ 25.4
million and $ 26.4
million as of
December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022 , respectively.

5. Business Combinations During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Company paid cash of $ 65.8
million for
one
acquisition. This acquisition did not materially affect the Company's results of operations. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, the Company made
two
acquisitions in cash and stock transactions totaling $ 2.7
billion. Included below is the information related to our material acquisition of Core-Mark. Core-Mark Acquisition On September 1, 2021, the Company acquired Core-Mark in a transaction valued at $ 2.4
billion, net of cash received. Under the terms of the transaction, Core-Mark shareholders received $ 23.875
per share in cash and
0.44
shares of the Company’s stock for each Core-Mark share outstanding as of August 31, 2021.

Credit Agreement PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, are parties to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 17, 2021 (the “ABL Facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The ABL Facility has an aggregate principal amount available of $ 4.0
billion and matures
September 17, 2026 .
Performance Food Group, Inc. is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by, and secured by the majority of the assets of, PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than the captive insurance subsidiary and other excluded subsidiaries).
Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders. Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.’s option, at
(a) the Base Rate (defined as the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus
0.5 %, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus
1.0 %) plus a spread, or (b) LIBOR plus a spread.
The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee rate of
0.25 %
per annum.

7. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and recognizes a financing or operating lease liability and right-of-use asset in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases are recognized based on present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Since the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. This rate was determined by using the yield curve based on the Company’s credit rating adjusted for the Company’s specific debt profile and secured debt risk. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The lease expenses for these short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has several lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components, such as maintenance, taxes, and insurance, which are accounted for separately. The difference between the operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities primarily relates to adjustments for deferred rent, favorable leases, and prepaid rent. Subsidiaries of the Company have entered into numerous operating and finance leases for various warehouses, office facilities, equipment, tractors, and trailers. Our leases have remaining lease terms of
1
year to
20
years, some of which include
options to extend the leases for up to
10
years , and some of which include
options to terminate the leases within 1 year . Certain full-service fleet lease agreements include variable lease payments associated with usage, which are recorded and paid as incurred. When calculating lease liabilities, lease terms will include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Certain of the leases for tractors, trailers, and other vehicles and equipment provide for residual value guarantees to the lessors. Circumstances that would require the subsidiary to perform under the guarantees include either (1) default on the leases with the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements, or (2) decisions not to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets, with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased assets specified in the lease agreements. Residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between
6 %
and
20 %
of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease. These leases have original terms ranging from
5
to
7
years
and are set to expire at various dates ranging from
2023
to
2028 . As of December 31, 2022, the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments for lease residual value guarantees totaled approximately
$ 12.5
million, which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had additional operating and finance leases that had not yet commenced which total
$ 445.4
million in future minimum lease payments.
These leases relate primarily to build-to-suit warehouse leases which will replace existing distribution centers and will commence upon building completion with terms of
15
to
20
years. In addition, these leases include vehicle leases expected to commence in fiscal 2023 with lease terms of
4
to
10
years.
8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, outstanding checks in excess of deposits, trade accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the relatively short maturities of those instruments. The derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value of long-term debt, which has a carrying value of $ 3,679.5
million and $ 3,908.8
million, is $ 3,527.2
million and $ 3,704.6
million at December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022 , respectively, and is determined by reviewing current market pricing related to comparable debt issued at the time of the balance sheet date, and is considered a Level 2 measurement.
9. Income Taxes The determination of the Company’s overall effective tax rate requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The effective tax rate reflects the income earned and taxed in various federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases and decreases in temporary and permanent differences between book and tax items, tax credits, and the Company’s change in income in each jurisdiction all affect the overall effective tax rate. It is the Company’s practice to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company’s effective tax rate was
26.1 %
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
26.5 % for the
three months ended January 1, 2022. The Company's effective tax rate was
26.2 %
for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and
22.6 % for the
six months ended January 1, 2022 . The effective tax rate varies from the
21 % statutory rate
primarily due to state taxes, federal credits, and other permanent items. The excess tax benefit of exercised and vested stock awards is treated as a discrete item. The effective tax rate for periods ended December 31, 2022, differed from the prior year periods primarily due to the relative size of stock-based compensation and other discrete permanent items as a percentage of book income. As of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022, the Company had net deferred tax assets of
$ 218.4
million and $ 204.9
million, respectively, and deferred tax liabilities of
$ 646.6
million and $ 629.2
million, respectively. As of both
December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022, the Company had established a valuation allowance of
$ 2.6
million, net of federal benefit, against deferred tax assets related to certain net operating losses which are not likely to be realized due to limitations on utilization. There was no change in the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized.
17
10. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The Company had outstanding contracts and purchase orders of $ 133.4
million related to capital projects and services including purchases of compressed natural gas for its trucking fleet at December 31, 2022. Amounts due under these contracts were not included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Guarantees
The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to indemnify various parties against claims from third parties. These contracts primarily relate to: (i)
certain real estate leases under which subsidiaries of the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities and other claims arising from their use of the applicable premises; (ii)
certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors, and employees under which the Company
may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship; and (iii)
customer agreements under which the Company may be required to indemnify customers for certain claims brought against them with respect to the supplied products.
Generally, a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts associated with these types of agreements are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been required to make payments under these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Litigation
The Company is engaged in various legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss arising from these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible to probable. When losses are probable and reasonably estimable, they have been accrued. Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and, if the Company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the Company’s current estimates of the range of potential losses, the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods.
JUUL Labs, Inc. Marketing Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation.
In October 2019, a Multidistrict Litigation action (“MDL”) was initiated in order to centralize litigation against JUUL Labs, Inc. (“JUUL”) and other parties in connection with JUUL’s e-cigarettes and related devices and components in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On March 11, 2020, counsel for plaintiffs and the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee filed a Master Complaint in the MDL ("Master Complaint") naming, among several other entities and individuals including JUUL, Altria Group, Inc., Philip Morris USA, Inc., Altria Client Services LLC, Altria Group Distribution Company, Altria Enterprises LLC, certain members of management and/or individual investors in JUUL, various e-liquid manufacturers, and various retailers, including the Company’s subsidiaries Eby-Brown and Core-Mark, as defendants. The Master Complaint also named additional distributors of JUUL products (collectively with Eby-Brown and Core-Mark, the “Distributor Defendants”). The Master Complaint contains various state law claims and alleges that the Distributor Defendants: (i) failed to disclose JUUL’s nicotine contents or the risks associated; (ii) pushed a product designed for a youth market; (iii) engaged with JUUL in planning and marketing its product in a manner designed to maximize the flow of JUUL products; (iv) met with JUUL management in San Francisco, California to further these business dealings; and (v) received incentives and business development funds for marketing and efficient sales. Individual plaintiffs may also file separate and abbreviated Short Form Complaints (“SFC”) that incorporate the allegations in the Master Complaint. JUUL and Eby-Brown are parties to a Domestic Wholesale Distribution Agreement dated March 10, 2020 (the "Distribution Agreement"), and JUUL has agreed to defend and indemnify Eby-Brown under the terms of that agreement and is paying Eby-Brown’s outside counsel fees directly. In addition, Core-Mark and JUUL have entered into a Defense and Indemnity Agreement dated March 8, 2021 (the "Defense Agreement") pursuant to which JUUL has agreed to defend and indemnify Core-Mark, and JUUL is paying Core-Mark’s outside counsel fees directly. On September 3, 2020, the Cherokee Nation filed a parallel lawsuit in Oklahoma state court against several entities, including JUUL, e-liquid manufacturers, various retailers, and various distributors, including Eby-Brown and Core-Mark, alleging similar claims to the claims at issue in the MDL (the “Oklahoma Litigation”). The defendants in the Oklahoma Litigation attempted to transfer the case into the MDL, but a federal court in Oklahoma remanded the case to Oklahoma state court before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation effectuated the transfer of the MDL, which means the Oklahoma Litigation is no longer eligible for transfer to the MDL. Since then, parties agreed to stay the Oklahoma Litigation and proceed to mediation after the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that public nuisance claims cannot be brought in consumer products cases. On October 25, 2022, JUUL notified the Company
18
that JUUL had reached a settlement agreement that will resolve the Oklahoma Litigation. On November 9, 2022, an order was entered dismissing the Oklahoma litigation, with prejudice, pursuant to the settlement. On December 6, 2022, JUUL announced that it had reached settlements with the plaintiffs in the MDL and related cases that had been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California (the “MDL Settlement”). On January 18, 2023, the parties who were set to participate in the first round of bellwether trials in the MDL submitted a joint status filing with the court in which they notified the court of, among other things, the settlement JUUL reached with the plaintiffs (the “Joint Status Filing”). According to JUUL’s announcement and the Joint Status Filing, the MDL Settlement encompasses the various personal injury, consumer class action, government entity, and Native American tribe claims made against JUUL and includes, among others, all of the Distributor Defendants (including Core-Mark and Eby-Brown) as released parties; however, the terms of the settlement agreement have not yet been disclosed to the Company. As a result of the MDL Settlement, all scheduling order dates (e.g., discovery and motion deadlines and the bellwether trial dates) in the MDL have been stayed with respect to Eby-Brown and Core-Mark. On September 10, 2021, Michael Lumpkins filed a parallel lawsuit in Illinois state court against several entities, including JUUL, e-liquid manufacturers, various retailers, and various distributors, including Eby-Brown and Core-Mark, alleging similar claims to the claims at issue in the MDL (the “Illinois Litigation”). Because there is no federal jurisdiction for this case, it will proceed in Illinois state court. Plaintiff alleges as damages that his use of JUUL products caused a brain injury that was later exacerbated by medical negligence. The court has entered a case management schedule, with a trial tentatively scheduled to take place in the first calendar quarter of 2024. Eby-Brown and Core-Mark have filed a substantive motion to dismiss. The parties are engaged in discovery. The defense and indemnity of Eby-Brown and Core-Mark for the Illinois Litigation is covered by the Distribution Agreement and the Defense Agreement, respectively. At this time, JUUL has not indicated that the Illinois Litigation is included under the MDL Settlement. If the Illinois Litigation is not resolved pursuant to the MDL Settlement or otherwise, the Company will continue to vigorously defend itself. On June 23, 2022, the FDA announced it had issued marketing denial orders (“MDOs”) to JUUL for all of its products currently marketed and sold in the U.S. According to the FDA, the MDOs banned the distribution and sale of all JUUL products domestically. That same day, JUUL filed a petition for review of the MDOs with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On June 24, 2022, the court of appeals stayed the MDOs and issued a briefing schedule in the case. Thereafter, JUUL informed the FDA that per applicable regulations it would submit a request for supervisory review of the MDOs to the FDA. In response, the FDA notified JUUL that upon further review of the briefing JUUL made to the court of appeals, the FDA determined there are scientific issues unique to JUUL’s Pre-Market Tobacco Application (“PMTA”) that warrant additional review. Accordingly, the FDA entered an administrative stay of the MDOs. If the FDA ultimately decides to maintain or re-issue the MDOs, the administrative stay will remain in place for an additional thirty days to provide JUUL the opportunity to seek further judicial relief. JUUL and the FDA filed a joint motion with the court of appeals to hold the petition for review in abeyance on July 6, 2022, which the court of appeals granted on July 7, 2022. At this time, the Company is unable to predict whether the FDA will approve JUUL’s PMTA or re-issue the MDOs, nor is the Company able to estimate any potential loss or range of loss in the event of an adverse finding against JUUL in any case that falls outside of the MDL Settlement. Tax Liabilities The Company is subject to customary audits by authorities in the jurisdictions where it conducts business in the United States and Canada, which may result in assessments of additional taxes.
11. Related-Party Transactions The Company participates in, and has an equity method investment in, a purchasing alliance that was formed to obtain better pricing, to expand product options, to reduce internal costs, and to achieve greater inventory turnover. The Company’s investment in the purchasing alliance was
$ 9.8
million as of December 31, 2022 and
$ 8.7
million as of July 2, 2022. For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recorded purchases of
$ 467.1
million and
$ 435.1
million, respectively, through the purchasing alliance. For the six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recorded purchases of
$ 965.6
million and
$ 900.8
million, respectively, through the purchasing alliance.

12. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potential common shares include outstanding stock-based compensation awards and expected issuable shares under the employee stock purchase plan. In computing diluted earnings per common share, the average closing stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased with the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method.
No
potential common shares were considered antidilutive for any of the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022. A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators for the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations is as follows:

Segment Informatio n
Based on the Company’s organization structure and how the Company’s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company has
three
reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. The Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or “Performance Brands.” Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit “Chain” restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Our Convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products, and other items to convenience stores across North America. Intersegment sales represent sales between the segments, which are eliminated in consolidation. Management evaluates the performance of each operating segment based on various operating and financial metrics, including total sales and Adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its measure of segment profit to Adjusted EBITDA as this is the metric reported to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") for purposes of reviewing operating results and making decisions about allocating resources. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used to evaluate management’s performance for purposes of determining their compensation under the Company’s incentive plans. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and excludes certain items that the Company does not consider part of its segments' core operating results, including stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, acquisition, integration and reorganization expenses, and gains and losses related to fuel derivatives.
Corporate & All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of the Company’s internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense. Corporate & All Other may also include capital expenditures for certain information technology projects that are transferred to the segments once placed in service. The presentation and amounts for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022 have been restated to reflect the change to the measure of segment profit to Adjusted EBITDA described above.   20

Item 2.	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section of the Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
Our Company
We market and distribute food and food-related products to customers across North America from our over 150 locations to over 300,000 customer locations in the “food-away-from-home” industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally branded products, and products bearing our customers’ brands. Our product assortment ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, and beverages. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers, as well as cigarettes and other tobacco products. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.
Based on the Company’s organization structure and how the Company’s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Our Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or “Performance Brands.” Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit “Chain” restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Our Convenience channel distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products and other items to convenience stores across North America. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.
On September 1, 2021, Performance Food Group Company completed the acquisition of Core-Mark. Refer to Note 5.

Key Factors Affecting Our Business
Our business, our industry and the U.S. economy are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the rate of inflation and fuel prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and the effects of health epidemics and pandemics. We continue to actively monitor the impacts of the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape on all aspects of our business. The Company and our industry may face challenges related to product supply, increased product and logistics costs, access to labor supply, lower disposable incomes due to inflationary pressures and macroeconomic conditions, and the emergence of COVID-19 variants. The extent to which these challenges will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain.
We believe that our long-term performance is principally affected by the following key factors:
• Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends.
Excluding the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry has increased steadily for several decades. The share increases in periods of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods.
23
• Food distribution market structure.
The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers’ satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry.
• Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives.
Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for each of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further selling, operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.
Net Sales
Net sales is equal to gross sales, plus excise taxes, minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration), inbound freight, and remittances of excise tax. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.
Adjusted EBITDA
Management measures operating performance based on our Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our ABL Facility and indentures (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our ABL Facility and indentures governing the Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029 relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our ABL Facility and indentures, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the ABL Facility and indentures). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our business on a consistent basis over time and for business planning purposes. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management’s performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029 in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours.
Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:
• excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
• does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;
24
• does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and
• does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt.
In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our ABL Facility and indentures. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:
• does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and other non-cash charges; and
• does not include acquisition, restructuring, and other costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations.
We have included the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended January 1, 2022
Net Sales
Net sales growth is a function of acquisitions, case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold.
Net sales increased $1.1 billion, or 8.3%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation and channel mix. Net sales increased $5.4 billion, or 23.2%, for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022 as a result of the acquisition of Core-Mark in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and an increase in selling price per case due to inflation and channel mix. Overall product cost inflation has continued to decline through the first six months of fiscal 2023 and was approximately 10.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 11.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2023. Total case volume increased 3.0% and 9.4%, including 6.6% and 6.7% of independent case growth, in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of fiscal 2022. Total organic case volume was flat in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year periods. Total organic case volume benefited from an increase of 4.3% and 4.4% in organic independent cases sold during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, growth in Performance Brands cases, and broad-based growth across Vistar's channels, offset by declines in our Foodservice Chain business.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $220.8 million, or 17.3%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold and growth in the independent channel. Gross profit increased $653.6 million, or 27.0%, for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Core-Mark in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, procurement related gains, and growth in the independent channel, partially offset by an increase in the LIFO reserve.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $134.6 million, or 11.0%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $53.7 million increase in personnel expense primarily
27
related to salaries and wages, commissions, annual bonus, and benefits and a $20.6 million increase in fuel expense primarily due to higher fuel prices for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior year period.
Operating expenses increased $424.4 million, or 18.3%, for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Core-Mark, as well as increases in personnel expense and fuel expense. Operating expenses include an incremental $192.8 million for Core-Mark in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to four months of operating expenses for Core-Mark in fiscal 2022. Operating expenses also increased as a result of a $95.5 million increase in personnel expenses primarily related to salaries and wages, commissions, annual bonus, and benefits and a $49.0 million increase in fuel expense primarily due to higher fuel prices for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a $15.8 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to prior year acquisitions for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period.
Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $116.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $125.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $215.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 to $244.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023. Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of the Core-Mark acquisition and a prior year acquisition within Foodservice.
Net Income
Net income increased $62.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by the increase in operating profit and an increase in other income, partially offset by increases in income tax expense and interest expense. Net income increased $153.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022 due to the increase in operating profit, partially offset by increases in income tax expense and interest expense. The increases in interest expense were primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rate and an increase in average borrowings outstanding during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year periods. The increase in other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily relates to realized and unrealized gains for fuel hedging instruments.
The Company reported income tax expense of $25.1 million and $59.3 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $3.0 million and $3.8 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 were 26.1% and 26.2%, respectively, compared to 26.5% and 22.6% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for periods ended December 31, 2022 differed from the prior year periods primarily due to the relative size of stock-based compensation and other discrete permanent items as a percentage of book income.
Segment Results
The Company has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on various operating and financial metrics, including their respective sales growth and Adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its measure of segment profit to Adjusted EBITDA as this is the metric reported to management for purposes of reviewing operating results and making decisions about allocating resources. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and excludes certain items that the Company does not consider part of its segments' core operating results, including stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, acquisition, integration and reorganization expenses, and gains and losses related to fuel derivatives. See Note 13.
Segment Information within Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements .
Corporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense.
The presentation and amounts for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022 have been restated to reflect the change to the measure of segment profit to Adjusted EBITDA described above.

Segment Results—Foodservice
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended January 1, 2022
Net Sales
Net sales for Foodservice increased $682.2 million, or 11.0%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and increased $1.7 billion, or 13.1%, from the first six months of fiscal 2022 to the first six months of fiscal 2023. These increases in net sales were driven by an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation and a prior year acquisition. Overall product cost inflation has continued to decline throughout the first six months of fiscal 2023 and was approximately 9.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 11.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2023. Securing new and expanding business with independent customers resulted in organic independent case growth of approximately 4.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and approximately 4.4% in the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to the prior year periods. For the quarter, independent sales as a percentage of total Foodservice sales were 38.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA for Foodservice increased $46.7 million, or 27.9%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and increased $112.7 million, or 33.4%, from the first six months of fiscal 2022 to the first six months of fiscal 2023.

Gross profit contributing to Foodservice's Adjusted EBITDA increased $124.6 million, or 15.5%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and
29
increased $272.8 million, or 16.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to the prior year periods. These increases in gross profit were driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold to independent customers, including more Performance Brands products sold to our independent customers. Additionally, gross profit benefited from the prior year acquisition. The increases in gross profit were partially offset by expected decreases in procurement gains as the rate of inflation declines.
Operating expenses impacting Foodservice's Adjusted EBITDA increased $78.0 million, or 12.2%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating expenses increased as a result of the prior year acquisition, a $34.0 million increase in personnel expenses primarily related to commissions, annual bonus, and benefits and an increase in fuel expense of $13.3 million primarily as a result of an increase in fuel prices.

These increases in net sales were driven primarily by an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation and channel mix, as well as case volume growth in the vending, office coffee service, office supply, and hospitality channels in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year periods.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA for Vistar increased $42.5 million, or 85.5%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and increased $86.7 million, or 108.5%, from the first six months of fiscal 2022 to the first six months of fiscal 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We borrow under our credit facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.
As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.
Our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond relate to our long-term debt and associated interest payments, operating and finance leases, and purchase obligations. For information regarding the Company’s expected cash requirements related to long-term debt and operating and finance leases, see Note 6.
Debt
and Note 7.
Leases , respectively, of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total purchase obligations of $133.4 million, which includes agreements for purchases related to capital projects and services in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, as well as a minimum amount due for various Company meetings and conferences. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed to various capital projects in process or scheduled to be completed in the coming fiscal years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments of $74.2 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and improvements and warehouse equipment. The Company anticipates using cash flows from operations or borrowings under the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments. Amounts due under these agreements were not included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes and to fund capital expenditures.
As of December 31, 2022, our cash balance totaled $13.3 million, including restricted cash of $7.2 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $18.7 million, including restricted cash of $7.1 million, as of July 2, 2022.

The following describes our financing arrangements as of December 31, 2022:
Credit Agreement :
PFGC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, are parties to the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility has an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion under the revolving loan facility, is scheduled to mature on September 17, 2026, and includes an alternative reference rate, which provides mechanisms for the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a replacement rate upon a LIBOR cessation event.
Performance Food Group, Inc. is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by, and secured by the majority of the assets of, PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to portraying our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those that pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, insurance programs, income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional incentives, leases, and goodwill and other intangible assets, which are described in the Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Form 10-K.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
