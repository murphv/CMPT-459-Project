Use
of estimates
Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue
recognition
In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
606,
Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients.
Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution.
Cost
of revenue
Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating, corporate development
advisory services and provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution.
Cash
and cash equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:

years
Tools

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference
between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss.
Investment
under equity method
The
Company apply the equity method to account for investments it possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor
possesses more than
20 % of the voting interests of the investee.
In
applying the equity method, the Company records the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the
investment by proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. The Company records dividends
or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment.

Income
taxes
Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a
greater than 50%
likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
Going
concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the period
ended January 31, 2023, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $ 1,895,296 , negative operating cash flow of $ 202,283
and net loss
of $ 134,883 . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of
the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company’s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing.

Net
loss per share
The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,
“Earnings per Share.”
Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive.
Foreign
currencies translation
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations.
The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (“US$”). The Company’s subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong
maintains its books and record in United States Dollars (“US$”) respectively, and Ringgits Malaysia (“MYR”) is
functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.
In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated
into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement ”, using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders’ equity.
Translation
of amounts from MYR into US$1 and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

(UNAUDITED)
Fair
value of financial instruments :
The
carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayment, deposits, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level
2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level
3:
Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
Leases
Prior
to August 1, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840,
Accounting for Leases . Effective August 1, 2019, the Company
adopted the guidance of ASC 842,
Leases,
which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result,
the comparative financial information has not been updated and the required disclosures prior to the date of adoption have not been updated
and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. (see Note 14).
Recent
accounting pronouncements
ASB
issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915)
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810,
Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance. The Company
has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations
and cash flows since inception.
In
May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement
of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments
in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification.
The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option
for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase
comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets.
Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13
while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10,
which to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting
companies applying for credit losses, leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date.
The
effective tax rate in the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad
range of income tax rates. The Company has subsidiaries that operate in various countries: United States, Labuan and Hong Kong that are
subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows:
United
States of America

of cumulative net operating losses which can be carried forward to offset
a maximum of
80 % future taxable income. The net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2038, if unutilized. The Company has
provided for a full valuation allowance of $ 675,274
against the deferred tax assets on the expected future tax benefits from the net
operating loss carry forwards as the management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the future.
Labuan
Under
the current laws of the Labuan, Phoenix Plus Corp.is governed under the Labuan Business Activity Act, 1990. The tax charge for such company
is based on
3 % of net audited profit.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC
280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with
the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about services categories, business segments and major customers
in financial statements. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating
decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to
segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures
about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material
operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in
economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of January 31, 2023. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.
