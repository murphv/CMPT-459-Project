DECEMBER

NOTE
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The
Glimpse Group, Inc. (“Glimpse” and together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively, the “Company”)
is a Virtual (VR) and Augmented (AR) Reality company, comprised of a diversified portfolio of wholly owned VR and AR software and services
companies. Glimpse’s subsidiary companies are located in the United States, Turkey and Australia. The Company was incorporated
in the State of Nevada in June 2016.
Glimpse’s
robust VR/AR ecosystem, collaborative environment and business model strive to simplify the many challenges faced by companies in an
emerging industry. Glimpse cultivates, optimizes and manages business operations while providing a strong network of professional relationships,
thereby allowing the subsidiary company to maximize their time and resources in pursuit of mission-critical endeavors, reducing time
to market, optimizing costs, improving product quality and leveraging joint go-to-market strategies, while simultaneously providing investors
an opportunity to invest directly into the VR/AR industry via a diversified platform.
The
Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market Exchange (“Nasdaq”)
on July 1, 2021, under the ticker VRAR. In addition, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) the Company sold
additional common stock to certain institutional investors in November 2021. See Note 8.
NOTE
2.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The
Company incurred losses of $ 4.07
million and $ 3.23
million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These
losses were incurred as the Company funded operational expenses, primarily research and development, general and administrative, and
sales and marketing costs.
The
Company expects to be cash flow neutral in the upcoming calendar year 2023. Management believes that the Company’s existing balances
of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as of the issuance date of these financial statements, which are approximately $ 6.0
million (excluding an additional $ 2
million held in escrow for potential future Sector 5 Digital, LLC (“S5D”) acquisition
performance payment obligations) and $ 1.50
million, respectively, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at
least twelve months from the date that these financial statements are issued. However, should the Company’s current cash and cash
equivalents not be sufficient to support the development of its business to the point at which it has positive cash flows from operations,
the Company plans to meet its future needs for additional capital through equity and/or debt financings. Equity financings may include
sales of common stock, including the utilization of a $ 100
million S3 registration statement filed with the United State Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 28, 2022. Such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or
at all. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to it when required, the Company’s
ability to continue to support its business growth, scale its infrastructure, develop product enhancements and to respond to business
challenges could be significantly impaired.
NOTE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and reflect all adjustments,
which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of December 31, 2022, the results
of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to these periods
are unaudited. The results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the entire year ending June 30, 2023 or for any subsequent periods. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2022 has been derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.

DECEMBER
31, 2022 AND 2021
Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and regulations.
These
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the balances of Glimpse and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Accounting Estimates
The
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
The
principal estimates relate to the valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts, stock options, warrants, revenue recognition, cost of
goods sold, allocation of the purchase price of assets relating to business combinations and calculation of contingent consideration
for acquisitions.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash
Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and deposits in bank checking accounts with immediate access and cash equivalents that represent
highly liquid investments.
Restricted
cash represents escrowed cash related to the Sector 5 Digital, LLC acquisition.
The
components of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2022 and 2021
are as follows:

Accounts
receivable consists primarily of amounts due from customers under normal trade terms. Allowances for uncollectible accounts are provided
for based upon a variety of factors, including historical amounts written-off, an evaluation of current economic conditions, and assessment
of customer collectability. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded as all amounts
were considered collectible.

Customer
Concentration and Credit Risk
Two
customers accounted for approximately
55 % ( 29 % and
26 %, respectively) of the Company’s total gross revenues during the three months
ended December 31, 2022. One of the same customers and a different customer accounted for approximately
75 % ( 45 % and
30 %, respectively)
of the Company’s total gross revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Two customers accounted for approximately
56 % ( 29 % and
27 %, respectively) of the Company’s total gross revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2022. One of the
same customers and a different customer accounted for approximately
67 % ( 49 % and
18 %, respectively) of the Company’s total gross
revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Two
customers accounted for approximately
45 % ( 24 % and
21 %, respectively) of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2022.
One of these customers and a different customer accounted for approximately
59 % ( 37 % and
22 %, respectively) of the Company’s accounts
receivable at June 30, 2022.
The
Company maintains cash in accounts that, at times, may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. The Company has
not experienced any losses on such accounts.
Business
Combinations
The
results of a business acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the
date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business generally being recorded at their
estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
is recognized as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
The
Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocates the purchase price to its respective assets and
liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may require management to use significant judgment
and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows. Estimates of fair
value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual
results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is typically one year from the acquisition date, if new information
is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, changes in the estimated values of the net assets
recorded may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent
adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. At times, the Company engages the assistance of valuation specialists
in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination.
Further,
during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer to account for the related revenue
contracts, acquired in the business acquisition, in accordance with ASC Topic 606
Revenue from Contracts with a Customer
as if
the Company had originated the contracts.

Intangible
assets (other than Goodwill)
Intangibles
represent the allocation of a portion of the acquisition’s purchase price (see Note 5). Intangibles are stated at allocated cost
less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. The Company reviews intangibles, being amortized, for impairment when current events indicate that the fair value may be less
than the carrying value.
Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted
for under the acquisition method. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested at least annually for impairment, or more frequently
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy, which is based on three levels of inputs, the first two of which are considered observable and the last unobservable,
that may be used to measure fair value, is as follows:
●
Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
●
Level 2 — inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
●
Level
3 — unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets or liabilities.
The
Company classifies its cash equivalents and investments within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis of valuations based on
quoted prices for the specific securities in an active market.
The
Company’s contingent consideration is categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration is recorded
within contingent consideration, current, and contingent consideration, non-current, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, and June 30, 2022. Contingent consideration has been recorded at its fair values using unobservable inputs and have
included using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing framework, incorporating contractual terms and assumptions regarding financial
forecasts, discount rates, and volatility of forecasted revenue. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level
3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company’s management with the assistance of
a third-party valuation specialist.
The
Company’s other financial instruments consist primarily of accounts receivable, note receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities
and other liabilities, and approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Revenue
Recognition
Nature
of Revenues
The
Company reports its revenues in two categories:
● Software
Services: Virtual and Augmented Reality projects, solutions and consulting services.
● Software
License and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”): Virtual and Augmented Reality software
that is sold either as a license or as a SaaS subscription.
The
Company applies the following steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations
under each of its agreements:
● identify
the contract with a customer;
● identify
the performance obligations in the contract;
● determine
the transaction price;
● allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract;
● recognize
revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied;
● determine
that collection is reasonably assured.
Revenue
is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer
or service is performed and collection is reasonably assured. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct
product or service to a customer. A portion of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to
transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct. Other
contracts can include various services and products which are at times capable of being distinct, and therefore may be accounted for
as separate performance obligations.
Revenue
is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or providing services.
As such, revenue is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Sales taxes and other taxes are excluded
from revenues.
For
distinct performance obligations recognized at a point in time, any unrecognized portion of revenue and any corresponding unrecognized
expenses are presented as deferred revenue/contract liability and deferred costs/contract asset, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Contract assets include cash and equity based payroll costs, and may include payments to consultants and vendors.
For
distinct performance obligations recognized over time, the Company records a contract asset (costs in excess of billings) when revenue
is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (billings in excess of costs) when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.
Significant
Judgments
The
Company’s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products/services. Determining whether products/services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
Further, judgment may be required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation.
Disaggregation
of Revenue
The
Company generated revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by delivering: (i) Software Services, consisting primarily
of VR/AR software projects, solutions and consulting services, and (ii) Software Licenses & SaaS, consisting primarily of VR and
AR software licenses or SaaS. The Company currently generates its revenues primarily from customers in the United States.

(UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER
31, 2022 AND 2021
Revenue
for a significant portion of Software Services projects and solutions (projects whereby, the development of the project leads to an identifiable
asset with an alternative use to the Company) is recognized at the point of time in which the customer obtains control of the project,
customer accepts delivery and confirms completion of the project.
Certain
other
Software Services
revenues are custom project solutions (projects whereby, the development
of the custom project leads to an identifiable asset with no alternative use to the Company, and, in which, the Company also has an enforceable
right to payment under the contract) and are therefore recognized based on the percentage of completion using an input model with a master
budget. The budget is reviewed periodically and percentage of completion adjusted accordingly.
Revenue
for Software Services consulting services and website maintenance is recognized when the Company performs the services, typically on
a monthly retainer basis.
Revenue
for Software License is recognized at the point of time in which the Company delivers the software and customer accepts delivery. If
there are significant contractually stated ongoing service obligations to be performed during the term of the Software License or SaaS
contract, then revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
Timing
of Revenue
The
timing of revenue recognition for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:

Timing
of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company generally records a receivable/contract asset
when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or deferred revenue/contract liability when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.
For
certain Software Services project contracts the Company invoices customers after the project has been delivered and accepted by the customer.
Software Service project contracts typically consist of designing and programming software for the customer. In most cases, there is
only one distinct performance obligation, and revenue is recognized upon completion, delivery and customer acceptance. Contracts may
include multiple distinct projects that can each be implemented and operated independently of subsequent projects in the contract. In
such cases, the Company accounts for these projects as separate distinct performance obligations and recognizes revenue upon the completion
of each project or obligation, its delivery and customer acceptance.
For
contracts recognized over time, contract liabilities include billings invoiced for software projects for which the contract’s performance
obligations are not complete.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER
31, 2022 AND 2021
For
certain other Software Services project contracts, the Company invoices customers for a substantial portion of the project upon entering
into the contract due to their custom nature and revenue is recognized based upon percentage of completion. Revenue recognized subsequent
to invoicing is recorded as a deferred revenue/contract liability (billings in excess of cost) and revenue recognized prior to invoicing
is recorded as a deferred cost/contract asset (cost in excess of billings).
For
Software Services consulting or retainer contracts, the Company generally invoices customers monthly at the beginning of each month in
advance for services to be performed in the following month. The sole performance obligation is satisfied when the services are performed.
Software Services consulting or retainer contracts typically consist of ongoing support for a customer’s software or specified
business practices.
For
Software License contracts, the Company generally invoices customers when the software has been delivered to and accepted by the customer,
which is also when the performance obligation is satisfied. For SaaS contracts, the Company generally invoices customers in advance at
the beginning of the service term.
For
multi-period Software License contracts, the Company generally invoices customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period.
Software License contracts consist of providing clients with software designed by the Company. For Software License contracts, there
are generally no ongoing support obligations unless specified in the contract (becoming a Software Service).
Unfulfilled
performance obligations represent amounts expected to be earned by the Company on executed contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company
had approximately $ 2.83
million in unfulfilled performance obligations.
Employee
Stock-Based Compensation
The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to grants to employees or service providers based on grant date fair values
of common stock or the stock options, which are amortized over the requisite period, as well as forfeitures as they occur.
The
Company values the options using the Black-Scholes Merton (“Black Scholes”) method utilizing various inputs such as expected
term, expected volatility and the risk-free rate. The expected term reflects the application of the simplified method, which is the weighted
average of the contractual term of the grant and the vesting period for each tranche. Expected volatility is derived from a weighted
average of volatility inputs for the Company. The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield of U.S. Treasury notes as of the grant
date with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.
Research
and Development Costs
Research
and development expenses are expensed as incurred, and include payroll, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research
and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs. Given the emerging industry and uncertain market
environment the Company operates in, research and development costs are not capitalized.
Earnings
Per Share
Basic
earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
shares of common stock outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include the issuance
of potential shares of common stock for outstanding stock options and warrants.

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
Adoption
of the New Lease Accounting Standard
On
July 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition method applied at
the adoption date of the standard. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2022 are presented under the new leasing standard,
while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting. The
Company has elected to utilize the package of practical expedients at the time of adoption, which allows the Company to (1) not reassess
whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) not reassess the lease classification of any expired or existing
leases, and (3) not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also has elected to utilize the short-term lease
recognition exemption and, for those leases that qualified, the Company did not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or
lease liabilities. As a result of adoption, the Company recorded ROU assets related to office facility leases which are recognized on
the consolidated balance sheet and the associated lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The present value
of the Company’s remaining lease payments, which comprise the lease liabilities, was estimated using an estimated incremental borrowing
rate as of the adoption date.
The
adoption resulted in no adjustment to July 1, 2022 accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet.
As
of July 1, 2022, the Company recorded right-of-use assets of $ 0.75
million, lease liabilities, current portion of $ 0.32
million and lease
liabilities, net of current portion of $ 0.43
million. With the purchase of Brightline Interactive, LLC (“BLI”), on August
1, 2022, the Company added right-of-use assets of $ 0.41
million, lease liabilities, current portion of $ 0.12
million and lease liabilities,
net of current portion of $ 0.29
million.
New
Lease Accounting Policies
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and determines the classification of the lease, as either operating or finance,
at commencement.
For
short-term leases with expected terms of less than 1 year, the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. The Company
does not have any finance leases. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease
liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized
at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases
is not readily determinable, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate to reflect
the profile of secured borrowing over the expected term of the leases based on the information available at the later of the initial
date of adoption or the lease commencement date.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect
on the Company’s financial statements.

ACQUISITION AND TECHNOLGY PURCHASE
Acquisition
(“BLI”)
On
May 25, 2022, Glimpse entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with BLI and each of the equity
holders of BLI named therein (collectively, the “Members”). BLI is an immersive technology company that provides VR and AR
based training scenarios and simulations for commercial and government customers. The acquisition significantly expands the Company’s
operating and financial scale, introduces new tier 1 customers specifically in the communication, entertainment and government segments,
and bolsters the executive management team.
In
August 2022, BLI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glimpse.
The
aggregate consideration to the Members per the Agreement consisted of: (a) $ 568,046
cash paid (net of working capital adjustments, as
defined, of $ 505,787 ) at August 1, 2022 closing (the “Closing”); (b) $ 1,926,167
of cash paid at the Closing to extinguish
BLI’s outstanding debt and pay down other obligations; (c)
714,286
shares of the Company’s common stock fair valued at the
Closing; and (d) future purchase price considerations payable to the Members, up to a residual of $ 24,500,000 . The $ 24,500,000
is based
and payable on BLI’s achievement of certain revenue growth milestones at points in time and cumulatively during the three years
post-Closing Date, the payment of which shall be made up to $ 12,000,000
in cash and the remainder in common shares of the Company, priced
at the dates of the future potential share issuance subject to a common stock price floor of $ 7.00
per share.
The
fair value allocation for the purchase price consideration paid at Closing (including subsequent post-closing adjustment) was recorded

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER
31, 2022 AND 2021
The
Company’s fair value estimate of the contingent consideration for the BLI acquisition was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
and other methods which account for the probabilities of various outcomes. The Company’s fair value estimate related to the identified
intangible asset of customer relationships was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. This valuation method requires
management to project revenues, customer attrition and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine
the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. The Company’s fair value estimate related to the identified
intangible asset of technology was determined using the Relief from Royalty Method. This valuation method requires management to estimate
the royalty rate based on market data for royalty arrangements involving similar technology, the obsolesce rate, and the weighted average
cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.
The
goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to new markets access and will be deductible for tax
purposes.
In
accordance with GAAP, the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured at December 31, 2022, based on market conditions
as of that date. The remeasurement resulted in a fair value amount at December 31, 2022 of $ 4.56
million, a decrease of approximately
$ 1.58
million since Closing. The decrease in fair value of the contingent consideration is driven by revisions to BLI’s revenue
projections and a decrease in the Company’s common stock price between the measurement dates. This decrease is recorded as a gain
in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations (see Note 6).

AUGGD
In
August 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary company, AUGGD, completed an acquisition of certain assets, as defined,
from ARI.
In
June 2022, AUGGD achieved its initial revenue threshold as defined in the asset acquisition agreement, and was issued shares of Company
stock in July 2022 reflecting the payment of additional asset acquisition consideration. The share issuance was done inclusive of netting
the outstanding balance of a $ 0.25
million note receivable due the Company by ARI (see Note 10). This additional consideration of approximately
$ 0.57
million was included in contingent consideration for acquisitions, current portion, in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30,
2022. As of December 31, 2022, it is not anticipated that AUGGD will meet any future consideration thresholds as defined in the asset
acquisition agreement.
Potential
Future Distributions Upon Divestiture or Sale
Upon
a divestiture or sale of a subsidiary company, the Company is contractually obligated to distribute up to
10 % of the net proceeds from
such divestiture or sale to the senior management team of the divested subsidiary company. Currently, there were no active discussions
pertaining to a potential divestiture or sale of any of the Company’s subsidiaries.
COVID-19
The
COVID-19 pandemic caused significant business and financial markets disruption worldwide and there was significant uncertainty around
the duration of this disruption and its ongoing effects on our business. This has primarily manifested itself in prolonged sales cycles.
We
continue to monitor the situation and the effects on our business and operations. While some level of potential uncertainty remains,
given the current state of the pandemic, our expected revenue growth and current cash balance, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19
to be material to our business and operations.
NOTE
12.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On February 8, 2023, the Company’s
Board of Directors and Compensation Committee authorized the Company to issue an aggregate of
2.2
million stock options, at a strike
price of $ 7.00
per share, to three executive founders of the Company, the vesting of which shall occur over four years from issuance
and is primarily based upon the achievement of significant annual revenue and stock price growth targets.  These stock options have
not been issued as of the date of this report, and will be detailed in an 8K upon issuance.

Total
revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $2.95 million compared to approximately $1.69 million for the
three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 75%. Total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately
$6.90 million compared to approximately $2.71 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 155%. The increase for
both periods reflect the addition of several subsidiary companies after December 31, 2021 and new customers.
We
break out our revenues into two main categories – Software Services and Software License.
●
Software
Services revenues are primarily comprised of VR/AR projects, services related to our software licenses and consulting retainers.
●
Software
License revenues are comprised of the sale of our internally developed VR/AR software as licenses or as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”).
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, Software Services revenue was approximately $2.89 million compared to approximately $1.61 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 80%. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Software
Services revenue was approximately $6.75 million compared to approximately $2.42 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021,
an increase of approximately 179%. The increase for both periods reflect the addition of several subsidiary companies after December
31, 2021 and new customers.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, Software License revenue was approximately $0.06 million compared to approximately $0.08 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consistent period over period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Software
License revenue was approximately $0.15 million compared to approximately $0.29 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting
a long term license agreement in the 2021 period. As the VR and AR industries continue to mature, we expect our Software License revenue
to continue to grow on an absolute basis and as an overall percentage of total revenue.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-project revenue (i.e., VR/AR Software and Services revenue only), was approximately $0.93
million compared to approximately $0.85 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 9%, reflecting
organic growth and the addition of new customers. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-project revenue accounted for approximately
32% of total revenues compared to approximately 50% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended December 31,
2022, non-project revenue (i.e., VR/AR Software and Services revenue only), was approximately $2.21 million compared to approximately
$1.70 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 30%, reflecting organic growth and the addition
of new customers. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, non-project revenue accounted for approximately 32% of total revenues compared
to approximately 63% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in both periods reflects the additions of Brightline Interactive
(“BLI”) and Sector 5 Digital (“S5D”), which
primarily generate project revenue, representing an increased
portion of total revenue.
Customer
Concentration
Two
customers accounted for approximately 55% (29% and 26%, respectively) of the Company’s total gross revenues during the three months
ended December 31, 2022. One of the same customers and a different customer accounted for approximately 75% (45% and 30%, respectively)
of the Company’s total gross revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Two customers accounted for approximately
56% (29% and 27%, respectively) of the Company’s total gross revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2022. One of the
same customers and a different customer accounted for approximately 67% (49% and 18%, respectively) of the Company’s total gross
revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
31
We
operate in an early stage industry, and customers are exploring various options for AR and VR solutions and acting as early adopters.
As such, there can be a high degree of variance on our source of revenues while customers are on-boarded and our software products and
solutions are integrated, measured and digested. A customer that may account for a higher percentage of revenue in one period may not
account for any revenue in subsequent periods. In some cases, those customers could re-engage after they have evaluated our solutions
and may or may not be a source of future revenue. Recently, a significant percentage of our revenues have come from two strategic customers.
A reduction of revenue from these strategic customers – which we do not currently anticipate – would have a detrimental impact
on the Company’s revenues. The addition of BLI and S5D has reduced the reliance on a single customer. In general, a customer that
makes up a significant portion of revenues in one period, often does not make up a significant portion in other periods. Given this dynamic
we expect this variability in Customer Concentration to continue until such point in time when our revenue has reached larger scale,
and with a larger portion of our revenues coming from Software Licenses/SaaS.

profit was approximately 70% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately 88% for the three months ended December

ended December 31, 2021. The decrease for both periods was driven by the addition of BLI and S5D lower margin project revenue.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, internal staffing was approximately $0.50 million (57% of total cost of goods sold)
and approximately $0.18 million (86% of total cost of goods sold), respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
internal staffing was approximately $1.25 million (60% of total cost of goods sold) and approximately $0.32 million (89% of total cost
of goods sold), respectively. The decrease for both periods in internal staffing as a percentage of total cost of goods sold was due
to the addition of BLI and S5D, which have a higher utilization of external sources.

Operating
expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $0.84 million compared to $3.05 million for the three
months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately 72%. The decrease is driven by a gain in the change in fair value of
contingent consideration for the S5D and BLI acquisitions; offset by expenses related to the addition of several new subsidiaries
(which includes headcount, amortization of intangibles and professional fees related to the acquisitions) and employee headcount
additions to support growth.
32
Operating
expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $9.01 million compared to $5.32 million for the six months
ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 69%. The increase is driven by expenses related to the addition of several new
subsidiaries (which includes headcount, amortization of intangibles and professional fees related to the acquisitions) and employee
headcount additions to support growth; offset by a gain in the change in fair value of contingent consideration for the S5D and BLI
acquisitions.
Research
and Development
Research
and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $2.53 million compared to $1.19 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 113%. Research and development expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 were approximately $4.53 million compared to $2.18 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase
of approximately 108%. For both periods, this reflects the addition of several new subsidiaries and headcount additions to support growth.
Going forward, we expect research and development costs to continue to increase as we continue to develop and commercialize our software
products.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-cash stock option expenses relating to research and development included approximately
$0.38 million of employee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 15% of total research and development expenses. For the three
months ended December 31, 2021, non-cash stock option expenses relating to research and development included approximately $0.26 million
of employee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 22% of total research and development expenses. For the six months ended
December 31, 2022, non-cash stock option expenses relating to research and development included approximately $0.77 million of employee
compensation expenses, comprising approximately 17% of total research and development expenses. For the six months ended December 31,
2021, non-cash stock option expenses relating to research and development included approximately $0.61 million of employee compensation
expenses, comprising approximately 28% of total research and development expenses. Over time, we expect non-cash stock options research and development expenses, as a percentage of the total related expenses, to continue to decrease as we utilize a larger
portion of cash for compensation thereby minimizing dilution.
General
and Administrative
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.26 million compared to $1.13 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 12%. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 were approximately $2.63 million compared to $1.89 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase
of approximately 39%. The increase for both periods primarily reflects expenses related to the addition of several new subsidiaries (which includes headcount, professional fees related to the acquisitions and facility costs) and additional independent board members.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-cash stock option expenses relating to general and administrative expenses included
approximately $0.18 million of employee and board of directors expenses, comprising approximately 14% of total general and
administrative expenses. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to
general and administrative expenses included approximately $0.24 million of employee, board of directors and vendor expenses,
comprising approximately 21% of total general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, non-cash
stock option expenses relating to general and administrative expenses included approximately $0.38 million of employee and board of
directors expenses, comprising approximately 14% of total general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended December 31,
2021, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to general and administrative expenses included approximately $0.46
million of employee, board of directors and vendor expenses, comprising approximately 24% of total general and administrative
expenses. Over time, we expect non-cash stock options and common stock general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of the
total related expenses, to continue to decrease as we utilize a larger portion of cash for compensation thereby minimizing
dilution.
33
Sales
and Marketing
Sales
and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.93 million compared to $0.66 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 192%. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 were approximately $3.68 million compared to $1.17 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase
of approximately 215%. The increase for both periods reflect expenses related to the addition of several new subsidiaries and
expansions to headcount and outside marketing firms to drive revenue growth. As our subsidiary companies continue to establish
initial market traction and grow their revenue base, we expect to increase our business development and sales expenses.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to sales and marketing expenses included
approximately $0.14 million of employee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 7% of total sales and marketing expenses. For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to sales and marketing expenses included
approximately $0.20 million of employee, vendor and fee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 30% of total sales and marketing
expenses. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to sales and marketing
expenses included approximately $0.52 million of employee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 14% of total sales and marketing
expenses. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, non-cash stock option and common stock expenses relating to sales and marketing
expenses included approximately $0.33 million of employee, vendor and fee compensation expenses, comprising approximately 28% of total
sales and marketing expenses. Over time, we expect non-cash stock options and common stock sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage
of the total related expenses, to continue to decrease as we utilize a larger portion of cash for compensation thereby minimizing dilution.
Amortization
of Acquisition Intangible Assets
Amortization
of acquisition intangible assets expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.54 million compared to $0.07
million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Amortization of acquisition intangible assets expense for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 were approximately $0.99 million compared to $0.08 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. For both periods,
this primarily reflects the addition of several new subsidiaries.
Change
in Fair Value of Acquisition Contingent Consideration
Change
in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was a gain of
approximately $5.42 and $2.82 million, respectively. For both periods, this represents a decrease in the fair value of the
contingent consideration liability related to the S5D and BLI acquisitions. The change in both periods is driven by a
decrease in the common stock price of Glimpse between measurement dates and revisions to revenue projections.

to an expense of $0.26 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The change is driven by a loss incurred on conversion of convertible
debt to common stock that occurred at the IPO in the 2021 period. Income for all periods reflects interest income on cash and cash equivalent

Net
Income (Loss)
Net
income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.31 million, as compared to a net loss of $1.57 million for the comparable
2021 period, an absolute change of $2.88 million. This change is driven by the non-cash gain on the change in fair value of
acquisition contingent consideration, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses from the acquisition of several
subsidiaries. We sustained a net loss of $4.07 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a net loss of $3.23
million for the comparable 2021 period, a loss increase of $0.84 million. This change is driven by the increase in operating
expenses from the acquisition of several subsidiaries, partially offset by the non-cash gain on change in fair value of acquisition
contingent consideration.
Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
The
following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP,
as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance,
financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to,
and should not be considered as alternatives to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), and cash flow from operating activities,
liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they
intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes
for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses and relies on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are
non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial
measures in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
Our
management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate
period-to-period comparisons. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the
described excluded items.
The
Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (or loss) from continuing operations before the items in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA
is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our
core operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items of a non-operational nature that affect comparability.
We
have included a reconciliation of our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the most comparable non-GAAP financial
measures. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons
between the Company and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use
different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition
being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable
SEC rules.

increased by $2.19 million compared to a $1.44 million loss for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases in EBITDA loss
were driven by an increase in operating expense outlays in all areas of the Company to propel future growth, including the
acquisition of several new subsidiaries. This is offset primarily by non-cash expenses, both stock based and fair value
driven.

Operating
Activities
Net
cash used in operating activities was $6.49 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $2.36 million during the
prior period, an increase of approximately $4.13 million. This is primarily driven by an increase in net loss and a decrease in accounts
payable and deferred revenue primarily related to the BLI acquisition, offset by increased non-cash expenses (primarily acquisition contingent
consideration fair value adjustment, stock based expenses and intangible asset amortization).
Investing
Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $2.6 million compared to $0.59 million
during the prior period, an increase of approximately $2.01 million. This primarily represents the cash portion of the BLI acquisition.
Financing
Activities
Cash
flow provided from financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was negligible, compared to $26.01 million for
the prior 2021 period. Cash flow for the 2021 period primarily reflects the net proceeds from our IPO and Securities Purchase
Agreement.
36
Capital
Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of $9.20 million, plus $0.2 million of liquid
corporate bond investments. The December 31, 2022 balances include $2.0 million cash escrow for potential future contingent consideration
of the S5D acquisition, payable upon achievement of S5D and the Company’s performance targets (refundable to Glimpse if targets
not achieved).
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding debt obligations.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had no issued and outstanding preferred stock.
The
Company believes that it is sufficiently funded to meet its operational plan and future obligations beyond the 12-month period from the
date of this filing.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our
management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the end of such period.
In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, we are required to apply judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework set forth
in the report entitled Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company’s internal control system, including
(i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring.
Based
on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
During
the period ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
