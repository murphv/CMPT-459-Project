LIVE VENTURES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED F INANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
(dollars in thousands, except per share)
Note 1:	Background and Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Live Ventures Incorporated, a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Live Ventures” or the “Company”). Live Ventures is a diversified holding company with a strategic focus on value-oriented acquisitions of domestic middle-market companies. The Company has four operating segments: Retail, Flooring Manufacturing, Steel Manufacturing, and Corporate and Other. The Retail segment includes Vintage Stock, Inc. (“Vintage Stock”), which is engaged in the retail sale of new and used movies, music, collectibles, comics, books, games, game systems and components. The Flooring Manufacturing segment includes Marquis Industries, Inc. (“Marquis”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of carpet and the sale of vinyl and wood floorcoverings. The Steel Manufacturing Segment includes Precision Industries, Inc. (“Precision Marshall”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of alloy and steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods, and The Kinetic Co., Inc. (“Kinetic”), which is engaged in the production of industrial knives and hardened wear products for the tissue and metals industries. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this interim information includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. This financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as of September 30, 2022
and for the fiscal year then ended included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 16, 2022 (the “2022 10-K”).
Note 2:	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The unaudited condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, and a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company records a non-controlling interest within stockholders’ equity for the portion of the entity’s equity attributed to the consolidated entities that are not wholly owned.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These reclassifications have no material effect on the reported financial results. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in connection with the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the estimated reserve for doubtful accounts, the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, fair values in connection with the analysis of goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived assets for impairment, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, and estimated useful lives for intangible assets and property and equipment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses instead of incurred losses. It also modified the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provided a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and the interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements. 7
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), codified as ASC 848 (“ASC 848”). The purpose of ASC 848 is to provide optional guidance to ease the potential effects on financial reporting of the market-wide migration away from Interbank Offered Rates to alternative reference rates. ASC 848 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference a reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Effective December 31, 2021, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) replaced the USD London Interbank-Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for most financial benchmarking. The guidance may be applied upon issuance of ASC 848 through December 31, 2022. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This update provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. This update is effective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.
The Company has adopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements.

Note 3:	Acquisitions Acquisition of Kinetic On June 28, 2022, Precision Marshall (“Precision”) acquired
100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Kinetic Co., Inc. (“Kinetic”), a Wisconsin corporation, which was accomplished through a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Precision also entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with Plant B-6, LLC, an affiliate of Kinetic, pursuant to which Precision received all of Kinetic's right, title, and interest in and to the land and improvements (collectively, the “Real Estate”) that Kinetic uses in its operations. The combined purchase price for the Kinetic shares and Real Estate was approximately $ 24.7
million, which was funded with approximately $ 11.0
million in borrowings under the company’s credit facility, approximately $ 8.3
million in proceeds from sale and leaseback of the Real Estate, a subordinated promissory note in the amount of $ 3.0
million to the Seller of Kinetic, $ 1.7
million of cash on-hand, a contingent earn-out liability valued at $ 997,000 , a working capital adjustment of approximately $ 400,000 , which was paid in cash, and a final fair value
adjustment of approximately $ 312,000 , which was noncash.
As of the date of acquisition, Precision entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with a third-party, independent of the Kinetic sellers, for the Real Estate. The sale price of the Real Estate was approximately $ 8.9
million, subject to closing fees of approximately $ 547,000 . The provisions of the lease agreement include a
20-year
lease term with two five-year renewal options. The base rent under the lease agreement is $ 600,000
for the first year of the term and a
2 % per annum escalator. The Lease Agreement is a “net lease,” such that the lessees are also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the Real Property incurred by the lessor. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The proceeds, net of closing fees, from the sale-leaseback were used to assist in funding the acquisition of Kinetic. Under the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $ 3.0
million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their estimates of fair value available as of June 28, 2022, as calculated by an independent third-party firm. Goodwill arising from the acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Kinetic to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and goodwill as of
December 31, 2022 (in $000’s):

Acquisition of Better Backers On July 1, 2022, Live acquired certain assets and intellectual property of Better Backers, a Georgia corporation, which was accomplished through an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). No liabilities were assumed as part of the acquisition. The purchase price, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, was approximately $ 3.2
million, which is comprised of $ 1.8
million that was paid upon closing, and the $ 1.4
million present value of $ 1.5
million of non-compete payments to be made over a 24-month period. In order to expedite the transaction, the acquisition was originally made by Live, and the $ 1.8
million paid upon closing was funded with borrowings under the Live’s credit line with Isaac Capital Group (“ICG”). On August 18, 2022, Marquis repaid the $ 1.8
million to ICG and assumed ownership of Better Backers. 9
In connection with the acquisition, Marquis entered into two 20-year building leases with Spyglass Estate Planning, LLC, a related party (see Note 14), with two options to renew for an additional five years each. The fair value of the buildings and improvement is approximately $ 9.3
million. The provisions of the lease agreements include an initial 24-month month-to-month rental period, during which the lessee may cancel with 90-day notice, followed by a
20-year
lease term with two five-year renewal options. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that it will not cancel during the initial 24-month term, and that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The base rent under the lease agreements is approximately $ 73,000
and $ 32,000
per month, respectively, for the first year of the term, and a
2.5 % per annum escalator. The lease agreements are each “net leases”, such that the lessee is also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the property. The Company has evaluated each lease and determined the rent amounts to be at market rates. These leases are being treated as finance leases for accounting purposes, as described in ASC 842 “ Leases”. Under the purchase price allocation, no goodwill was recognized. The values assigned to the assets acquired are based on their estimates of fair value available as of July 1, 2022, as calculated by management. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Better Backers to the acquired identifiable assets (in $000’s):

Note 4:	Leases The Company leases retail stores, warehouse facilities, and office space. These assets and properties are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various future dates with many agreements containing renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have been classified as either operating or finance leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases percentage rent, and require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes, and other maintenance costs. As a result, the Company recognizes assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The amounts recognized reflect the present value of remaining lease payments for all leases. The discount rate used is an estimate of the Company’s blended incremental borrowing rate based on information available associated with each subsidiary’s debt outstanding at lease commencement. In considering the lease asset value, the Company considers fixed and variable payment terms, prepayments and options to extend, terminate or purchase. Renewal, termination, or purchase options affect the lease term used for determining lease asset value only if the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. As of December 31, 2022 , the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is
9.12
years. The Company's weighted average discount rate for operating leases is
6.13 %. Total cash payments for operating leases for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
were approximately $ 2.4
million and $ 2.5
million, respectively. Additionally, we obtained right-of-use assets in exchange for lease liabilities of approximately $ 1.8
million upon commencement of operating leases during the
three months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 , the weighted average remaining lease term for finance leases is
27.47
years. The Company's weighted average discount rate for finance leases is
13.24 %. Total cash payments for finance leases for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
were approximately $ 481,000
and $ 0 , respectively. No additional finance leases were commenced during the
three months ended December 31, 2022. The following table details our right of use assets and lease liabilities as of

Bank of America Revolver Loan On
January 31, 2020 , Marquis entered into an amended $ 25.0
million revolving credit agreement (“BofA Revolver”) with Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”). The BofA Revolver is a five-year, asset-based facility that is secured by substantially all of Marquis’ assets. Availability under the BofA Revolver is subject to a
monthly
borrowing base calculation. Marquis’ ability to borrow under the BofA Revolver is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including meeting all loan covenants under the credit agreement with BofA. The BofA Revolver has a variable interest rate and matures in January 2025. As of
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 , the outstanding balance was approximately $ 11.7
million and $ 10.1
million, respectively. Fifth Third Bank On January 20, 2022, Precision Marshall refinanced its Encina Business Credit loans with Fifth Third Bank, and the balance outstanding was repaid. The refinanced credit facility, totaling $ 29
million, is comprised of $ 23.0
million in revolving credit, $ 3.5
million in M&E lending, and $ 2.5
million for capital Capex lending.
Advances under the new credit facility will bear interest at the 30-day SOFR plus 200 basis points for lending under the revolving facility, and 30-day SOFR plus 225 basis points for M&E and Capex lending (Effective December 31, 2021, SOFR replaced the USD LIBOR for most financial benchmarking). The refinancing of the Borrower’s existing credit facility reduces interest costs and improves the availability and liquidity of funds by approximately $ 3.0
million at the close. The facility terminates on
January 20, 2027 , unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. In connection with the acquisition of Kinetic, the existing revolving facility was amended to add Kinetic as a borrower. In addition, two additional term loans were executed to fund the purchase of Kinetic. Approximately $ 6.0
million was drawn from the revolving facility, and the term loans were opened in the amounts of $ 4.0
million and $ 1.0
million, respectively. The $ 4.0
million term loan, which matures on
January 20, 2027 , carries the same terms for M&E term lending as stated above. The $ 1.0
million term loan, which matures on
June 28, 2025 , is a “Special Advance Term Loan”, and bears interest at SOFR plus 375 basis points. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 , the outstanding balance on the revolving loan was approximately $ 25.8
million and $ 23.6
million, respectively, and the outstanding balance on the original term note was approximately $ 3.0
million and $ 3.2
million, respectively. The revolving loan has a variable interest rate and matures in January 2027. As of
December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022 , the outstanding balance on the two term loans to fund the Kinetic acquisition were approximately $ 4.5

monthly
borrowing base calculation. The TCB Revolver has a variable interest rate and matures in

Note 13:	Earnings Per Share Net income per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Basic weighted average common shares outstanding do not include shares of restricted stock that have not yet vested, although such shares are included as outstanding shares in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the additional common shares issuable in respect of restricted share awards, stock options and convertible preferred stock. Preferred stock dividends are subtracted from net earnings to determine the amount available to common stockholders.

Note 15:
Commitments and Contingencies Litigation SEC Matter On February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Company’s financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc., and the change in auditors. On August 12, 2020, three of the Company’s corporate executive officers (together, the “Executives”) each received a “Wells Notice” from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company’s SEC investigation.
On October 7, 2020, the Company received a “Wells Notice” from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company’s previously-disclosed SEC investigation. The Wells Notices related to, among other things, the Company’s reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart, Inc. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives to allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. On October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC inquiry and provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018. On August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint (the “SEC Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers as defendants (collectively, the "Company Defendants") as well as certain other third parties. The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Defendants, officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.
On October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third party-defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants’ motion to dismiss but granted one of the third-party defendant’s motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. One third-party defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. On February 1, 2023, the court denied the third-party defendant’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The parties have agreed to participate in a mediation and to continue the remainder of discovery until after the mediation, scheduled to take place in April 2023. The Company Defendants strongly dispute and deny the allegations and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against the claims. 19
On August 13, 2021, Daniel E. Sieggreen, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint for violation of federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, naming as defendants the Company and the two executive officers named in the SEC Complaint. The allegations asserted are similar to those in the SEC Complaint. Among other relief, the complaint seeks damages in connection with the purchases and sales of the Company’s securities between December 28, 2016 and August 3, 3021. As of December 17, 2021, the judge granted a stipulation to stay proceedings pending the resolutions of the motions to dismiss in the SEC Complaint. On February 1, 2023, the final motion to dismiss relating to the SEC Complaint was denied, which was subsequently noticed in the Sieggreen action on February 2, 2023.
As a result, the plaintiff in this action has until on or about April 3, 2023 to file an amended complaint.
The Company and its executives anticipate moving to dismiss the amended complaint as they strongly dispute and deny the allegations at issue in this case and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against these claims. Holdback Matter On October 10, 2022, a representative for the former shareholders of Precision Industries, Inc.
filed a civil complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint alleges that the Company violated the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated July 14, 2020, by failing to pay the shareholders a certain indemnity holdback of $2,500,000. Plaintiff alleges that it effectuated service of the complaint on Company, but the Company did not receive notification of the action until it received an Application for Default Judgment filed with the court on December 26, 2022. On December 28, 2022, the court issued a letter order questioning its jurisdiction over the matter and directed plaintiff’s counsel to submit briefing as to why it believes jurisdiction is proper. Plaintiff filed its brief on January 13, 2023. The court has not ruled as to whether it will exercise jurisdiction over the matter. The Company’s counsel has had contacted plaintiff’s counsel regarding the case and advised that the Company denies the allegations waged against it in the complaint and that it will abide by the court’s ruling on the threshold jurisdictional issue. The case will proceed once the court rules on the jurisdictional issue at which point the Company will vigorously defend against these claims. . Wage and Hour Matter On July 27, 2022, Irma Sanchez, a former employee Elite Builder Services, Inc. (“Elite Builders”) (see Note 17), filed a class action complaint against Elite Builders in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda. The complaint alleges that Elite Builders failed to pay all minimum and overtime wages, failed to provide lawful meal periods and rest breaks, failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements, and failed to pay all wages due upon separation as required by California law. The complaint was later amended as a matter of right on October 4, 2022. Further, Ms. Sanchez has put the Labor & Workforce Development Agency on notice to exhaust administrative remedies and enable her to bring an additional claim under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, which permits an employee to assert a claim for violations of certain California Labor Code provisions on behalf of all aggrieved employees to recover statutory penalties. A Motion for Change of Venue to Stanislaus County was filed by Elite Builders on December 7, 2022. The hearing on the motion was heard on February 8, 2023. The Company believes that Ms. Sanchez’s claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend this action. The Company is currently unable to estimate the range of possible losses associated with this proceeding since no discovery has commenced and the scope of class is not yet known. Generally The Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. The ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As applicable, liabilities pertaining to these matters, that are probable and estimable, have been accrued.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Preparation of these statements requires us to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant and material impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are based on management's experience and other information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Our actual realized results may differ materially from management’s initial estimates as reported. Our critical and significant accounting policies include Trade and Other Receivables, Inventories, Goodwill, Revenue Recognition, Fair Value Measurements, Income Taxes, Segment Reporting and Concentrations of Credit Risk. For a summary of our significant accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates thereon, see Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements - Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements Note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies in our 10-K report as filed on December 16, 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA
We evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures such as revenue and “Adjusted EBITDA.” Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the business, including the business’ ability to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures, and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate a company’s financial performance, subject to certain adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by GAAP, and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Live Ventures Incorporated, should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Revenue
Revenue decreased approximately $6.2 million, or 8.2%, to approximately $69.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to reduced demand due to inflationary pressures in all segments, as well as supply chain issues and overall product mix in our Retail Segment. The increase in revenue for our Steel Manufacturing segment was primarily due to the acquisition of Kinetic.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 68.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 63.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the decreases in revenues, partially offset by inflationary cost increases and the acquisition of Kinetic.
General and Administrative Expense
General and Administrative expenses increased by 3.1% to approximately $14.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Kinetic, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and other General and Administrative expenses.
Selling and Marketing Expense
Selling and marketing expense decreased by 9.0% to approximately $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreased trade show and convention activity related to our Flooring Manufacturing segment.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net increased by approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased debt balances, as well as increased interest rates.

Retail Segment
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $2.9 million, or 11.2%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reduced demand as a result of inflationary factors, supply chain issues, and overall product mix. Further, effective April 2022, ApplianceSmart shut down its operations. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 47.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as opposed to 48.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $3.7 million, as compared to operating income of approximately $4.8 million for the prior year period.
Flooring Manufacturing Segment
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $6.4 million, or 19.6%, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to reduced demand as a result of inflationary factors. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 82.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as opposed to 72.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in raw material costs, as compared to the prior year period. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $750,000, as compared to operating income of approximately $4.6 million for the prior year period.
Steel Manufacturing Segment
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $5.6 million, or 45.4%, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Kinetic. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 75.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as opposed to 70.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in raw material costs, as compared to the prior year period, as well as the acquisition of Kinetic. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.5 million, as compared to operating income of approximately $1.7 million in the prior year period.
Corporate and Other Segment
Segment results for Corporate and Other includes our directory services business and our investment in SW Financial. Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $2.4 million, or 65%, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased revenue for SW Financial. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in commissions derived from stock market trading activity due to market volatility, as well as a decrease in commissions derived from initial public offerings and private placements due to reduced activity. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 47.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as opposed to 57.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.3 million, as compared to a loss of approximately $665,000 in the prior period. Revenues and operating income for our directory services business continue to decline due to decreasing renewals. We expect revenue and operating income from this business to continue to decrease in the future. We are no longer accepting new customers in our directory services business. We anticipate revenues from our investment in SW Financial to trend upward in the future.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $4.6 million, or 37.7%, for three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in revenue and gross profit, which is primarily due to our Flooring Manufacturing segment, as discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of approximately $12.8 million and approximately $21.2 million of available borrowing under our revolving credit facilities.
The Company's restricted cash of approximately $890,000 is required collateral for a standby letter of credit for a customs bond, which is renewed annually.
As we continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.
Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our asset-based revolver lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, pay our scheduled loan payments, allow for the repurchase of shares under our share buyback program, and pay dividends on our shares of Series E Preferred Stock as declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months.
Working Capital
We had working capital of approximately $78.1 million as of December 31, 2022, as compared to working capital of approximately $78.4 million as of September 30, 2022.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The Company’s cash and restricted cash, as of December 31, 2022, was approximately $12.8 million compared to approximately $4.6 million as of September 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $8.2 million. Net cash provided by operations was approximately $6.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net cash provided by operations of approximately $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to receipts of accounts receivable, partially offset by timing of payments on accounts payable.
Our primary sources of cash inflows are from customer receipts from sales on account, factored accounts receivable proceeds, receipts for securities sales commissions, and net remittances from directory services customers processed in the form of ACH billings. Our most significant cash outflows include payments for raw materials and general operating expenses, including payroll costs and general and administrative expenses that typically occur within close proximity of expense recognition.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Our cash flows used in investing activities were approximately $1.3 million and $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and consisted of purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Our cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $3.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 consisted of net proceeds from notes payable of approximately $5.7 million, partially offset by payments of notes payable and financing leases of approximately $1.8 million, and purchases of treasury stock in the amount of approximately $620,000.
Our cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $4.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021 consisted of net proceeds from notes payable of approximately $5.5 million, and approximately $2.0 million in net payments under revolver loans, partially offset by payments of notes payable and financing leases of approximately $3.4 million.
Currently, the Company is not issuing common shares for liquidity purposes. We prefer to use asset-based lending arrangements and mezzanine financing together with Company provided capital to finance acquisitions and have done so historically. Occasionally, as our Company history has demonstrated, we will issue stock and derivative instruments linked to stock for services and/or debt settlement.
Future Sources of Cash; New Products and Services
We may require additional debt financing or capital to finance new acquisitions, refinance existing indebtedness or other strategic investments in our business. Other sources of financing may include stock issuances and additional loans; or other forms of financing. Any financing obtained may further dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As of December 31, 2022, we did not participate in any market risk-sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required. We believe we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases or commodity price risk. We believe we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases or commodity price risk.
ITEM 4.
CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure control and Procedures . We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)).
Based upon that evaluation,
as
of
December 31, 2022 ,
we concluded that the Company's
disclosure,
controls, and
procedures
were effective .
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, do not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. These inherent limitations include the following: judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes, controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Our management assessed the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) of 2013 regarding Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2022, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION
ITEM 1.
Legal
Proceedings
Please refer to "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for information regarding material pending legal proceedings. Except as set forth therein and below, there have been no new material legal proceedings and no material developments in the legal proceedings previously disclosed.
SEC Matter
On February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Company’s financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc., and the change in auditors. On August 12, 2020, three of the Company’s corporate executive officers (together, the “Executives”) each received a “Wells Notice” from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company’s SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a “Wells Notice” from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company’s previously-disclosed SEC investigation. The Wells Notices related to, among other things, the Company’s reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart, Inc. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives to allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. On October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC inquiry and provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018.
On August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint (the “SEC Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers as defendants (collectively, the "Company Defendants") as well as certain other third parties. The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Defendants, officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.
On October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third party-defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants’ motion to dismiss but granted one of the third-party defendant’s motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. One third-party defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. On February 1, 2023, the court denied the third-party defendant’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The parties have agreed to participate in a mediation and to continue the remainder of discovery until after the mediation, scheduled to take place in April 2023.
The Company Defendants strongly dispute and deny the allegations and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against the claims.
On August 13, 2021, Daniel E. Sieggreen, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint for violation of federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, naming as defendants the Company and the two executive officers named in the SEC Complaint. The allegations asserted are similar to those in the SEC Complaint. Among other relief, the complaint seeks damages in connection with the purchases and sales of the Company’s securities between December 28, 2016 and August 3, 3021. As of December 17, 2021, the judge granted a stipulation to stay proceedings pending the resolutions of the motions to dismiss in the SEC Complaint. On February 1, 2023, the final motion to dismiss relating to the SEC Complaint was denied, which was subsequently noticed in the Sieggreen action on February 2, 2023.
As a result, the plaintiff in this action has until on or about April 3, 2023 to file an amended complaint.
The Company and its executives anticipate moving to dismiss the amended complaint as they strongly dispute and deny the allegations at issue in this case and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against these claims.
31
Holdback Matter
On October 10, 2022, a representative for the former shareholders of Precision Industries, Inc.
filed a civil complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint alleges that the Company violated the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated July 14, 2020, by failing to pay the shareholders a certain indemnity holdback of $2,500,000. Plaintiff alleges that it effectuated service of the complaint on Company, but the Company did not receive notification of the action until it received an Application for Default Judgment filed with the court on December 26, 2022. On December 28, 2022, the court issued a letter order questioning its jurisdiction over the matter and directed plaintiff’s counsel to submit briefing as to why it believes jurisdiction is proper. Plaintiff filed its brief on January 13, 2023. The court has not ruled as to whether it will exercise jurisdiction over the matter. The Company’s counsel has had contacted plaintiff’s counsel regarding the case and advised that the Company denies the allegations waged against it in the complaint and that it will abide by the court’s ruling on the threshold jurisdictional issue. The case will proceed once the court rules on the jurisdictional issue at which point the Company will vigorously defend against these claims.
Wage and Hour Matter
On July 27, 2022, Irma Sanchez, a former employee Elite Builder Services, Inc. (“Elite Builders”) (see Note 17 above), filed a class action complaint against Elite Builders in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda. The complaint alleges that Elite Builders failed to pay all minimum and overtime wages, failed to provide lawful meal periods and rest breaks, failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements, and failed to pay all wages due upon separation as required by California law. The complaint was later amended as a matter of right on October 4, 2022. Further, Ms. Sanchez has put the Labor & Workforce Development Agency on notice to exhaust administrative remedies and enable her to bring an additional claim under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, which permits an employee to assert a claim for violations of certain California Labor Code provisions on behalf of all aggrieved employees to recover statutory penalties. A Motion for Change of Venue to Stanislaus County was filed by Elite Builders on December 7, 2022. The hearing on the motion was heard on February 8, 2023. The Company believes that Ms. Sanchez’s claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend this action. The Company is currently unable to estimate the range of possible losses associated with this proceeding since no discovery has commenced and the scope of class is not yet known.
