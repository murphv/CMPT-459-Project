(unaudited)
1.
Organization and Nature of Operations
American
Battery Technology Company (“the Company”) is a startup company in the lithium–ion battery industry that is working
to increase the domestic production of battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese through its engagement in the
exploration of new primary resources of battery metals, in the development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction
of these battery metals from primary resources, and in the commercialization of an internally developed integrated process for the recycling
of lithium–ion batteries. Through this three–pronged approach the Company is working to both increase the domestic production
of these battery materials and ensure that as battery components reach the end of their useful lives, their metals are returned to the domestic
manufacturing supply chain in a closed–loop fashion.
The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2011, for the purpose of acquiring rights to mineral properties
with the eventual objective of being a producing mineral company. We have limited operating history and have not yet generated or realized
any revenues from our activities. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Washington Street, Suite 100, Reno, NV 89503.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 8.6
million and used cash of $ 7.4
million for operating activities.
On December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 147.3
million.
The
Company believes its current cash holdings will be sufficient to meet its future working capital needs. The Company cannot give assurance
that it can increase its cash balances or limit its cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for its planned operations.
The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to raise additional
capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Management believes that the Company has sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its operations
for at least one year from the date of issuance of the accompanying financial statements.
These
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a)
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.
These
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Oroplata Exploraciones
E Ingenieria SRL (inactive),
LithiumOre Corporation (formerly Lithortech Resources Inc) and ABTC AG, LLC. All inter–company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Certain
prior year amounts disclosed in “General and administrative” expenses on the Statements of Operations have been
reclassified to “Research and development” expense for consistency with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2021.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
b)
Interim Financial Statements
These
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and
in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The interim financial statements and
notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10–K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for
any future period.
c)
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of stock–based compensation, recoverability of long–lived assets and
deferred income tax asset valuation allowances.
The
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by
the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between
the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d)
Loss per Share
The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic
and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period.
Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if–converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock awards and warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential
shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
On
December 31, 2022, the Company had
65,651,414
potentially dilutive shares consisting of share purchase warrants exercisable into
40,210,611
common shares and restricted share units (RSUs) equivalent to
25,440,803
common shares.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
e)
Mining Properties
Costs
of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral
exploration costs as incurred as it is still in the exploration stage. If the Company identifies proven and probable reserves in its
investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it will enter the development stage and capitalize
future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs are amortized
on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the commencement of production. Interest expense allocable
to the cost of developing mining properties and to construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended
use.
To
date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being

930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining: Business Combinations” states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore,
extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights which are considered
tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As
a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated
with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.
f)
Research and development costs
Research
and development (“R&D”) costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 730, “Research and Development.” ASC 730-10-25
requires that all R&D costs be recognized as an expense as incurred. However, some costs associated with R&D activities that
have an alternative future use (e.g., materials, equipment, facilities) may be capitalizable.
The
Company has been awarded federal grant awards for specific R&D programs. Under ASU No. 2021-10
“Government Assistance,” the
Company recognizes invoiced government funds as an offset to R&D costs in the period the qualifying costs are incurred. The Company
believes this best reflects the expected net expenditures associated with these programs.
g)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
November 2021, FASB issued ASU No. 2021–10 “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government
Assistance.” This ASU will improve the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring the
disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance
on a business entity’s financial statements. ASU No. 2021–10 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2021, with early application permitted. This ASU is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2022.

Leases
A
lease provides the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration. Operating lease
right–of–use assets (“RoU assets”) are presented within the asset section of the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, while lease liabilities are included within the liability section of the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets
as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2022.
RoU
assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the
Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
RoU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. Most operating leases contain renewal options that provide for rent increases based on prevailing market conditions. The terms
used to calculate the RoU assets for certain properties include the renewal options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.

Leases (continued)
The
discount rate used to determine the commencement date present value of lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease, or
when that is not readily determinable, the Company estimates a rate of
8.00 % for the six months ending December 31, 2022, based on historical
lending agreements. RoU assets include any lease payments required to be made prior to commencement and exclude lease incentives. Both
RoU assets and lease liabilities exclude variable payments not based on an index or rate, which are treated as period costs. The Company’s
lease agreements do not contain significant residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants.
The
Company occupies office facilities under lease agreements that expire at various dates. The Company does not have any significant
finance leases. Total operating lease costs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were $ 97,000
and $ 15,000 ,

Commitments and Contingencies
From
time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm business. Management is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that could have, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Operating
Leases
We
lease our principal office location in Reno, Nevada. We also lease two adjacent lab spaces in the University of Nevada, Reno on
short term leases. The principal office location lease expires on November 30, 2024 and the lab leases expire on March 15, 2023.
Consistent with the guidance in ASC 842 “Leases,” we have recorded the principal office lease in our consolidated
balance sheet as an operating lease. For further information on operating lease commitments, refer to Note 6 –
Leases.
Financial
Assurance
Nevada
and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mining operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided
for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. ABTC has satisfied financial
assurance requirements using a combination of cash bonds and surety bonds. The amount of financial assurance ABTC is required to provide
will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2022, ABTC’s
financial assurance obligations associated with U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration cost estimates totaled approximately $ 20,000 ,
for which the Company is legally required to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in Tonopah, Nevada.
The Company was previously released of most of its liability in the Railroad Valley region of Nevada.

Overview
American
Battery Technology (“the Company”) is a startup company in the lithium–ion battery industry that is working to increase
the domestic US production of battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese through its engagement in the exploration
of new primary resources of battery metals, in the development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction of these
battery metals from primary resources, and in the commercialization of an internally developed integrated process for the recycling of
lithium–ion batteries. Through this three–pronged approach the Company is working to both increase the domestic production
of these battery materials, and to ensure spent batteries have their elemental battery metals returned to the domestic manufacturing
supply chain in an economical, environmentally-friendly, closed–loop fashion.
To
implement this business strategy, the Company is currently constructing its first integrated lithium–ion battery recycling facility,
which will take in waste and end–of–life battery materials from the electric vehicle, stationary storage, and consumer electronics
industries. The construction, commissioning, and operations of this facility are of the highest priority to the Company, and as such
it has significantly increased the resources devoted to its execution including the further internal hiring of technical staff, expansion
of laboratory facilities, and purchasing of equipment. The Company has been awarded a competitively bid grant from the US Advanced Battery
Consortium to accelerate the development and demonstration of this pre–commercial scale integrated lithium–ion battery recycling
facility. The Company has been notified that it has been selected for an additional grant award under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
to validate, test, and deploy three disruptive advanced separation and processing technologies in its existing lithium-ion battery recycling
Pilot Plant. See Part II: Item 5: Other Information for additional details on the status of the award contract.
Additionally,
the Company is accelerating the demonstration and commercialization of its internally developed low–cost and low–environmental
impact processing train for the manufacturing of battery grade lithium hydroxide from Nevada–based sedimentary claystone resources.

Components
of Statements of Operations
Operating
Expenses
Exploration
costs consist primarily of expenditures related to the drilling, travel, and soil sampling costs in the exploration of new primary resources
of battery metals.
General
and administrative expenses consist of office expense, legal, salaries and benefits and laboratory costs. The Company has significantly
reduced the number of shares it issues for professional services.
During the period six months ended, the Company
granted 27.2 million RSUs with a grant date fair value of approximately $13.8 million,
of which, 11.1 million RSUs were granted, with a grant date fair value of $5.7 million, to officers and directors of the
Company. As of December 31, 2022, total compensation expense related to the Company’s unvested awards of $10.4 million is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3. years.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $8.8 million of operating expenses compared to $24.1 million of operating
expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company has largely transitioned to a service-based vesting requirement for
its share-based awards, contrary to shares issued directly to consultants, employees, directors without a continuation of service requirement.
Grant Funding
On
August 16, 2021, ABTC received a contract award for a 30-month project with a total budget of $2.0 million from the US Advanced Battery
Consortium (the “USABC grant”) as part of a competitively bid project, through which ABTC will receive reimbursement
for up to $500,000 of eligible expenditures. The objective of the contract award is for the commercial-scale development and demonstration
of an integrated lithium-ion battery recycling system, the production of battery cathode grade metal products, the synthesis of high
energy density active cathode material from these recycled battery metals, and then the fabrication of large format automotive battery
cells from these recycled materials and the testing of these cells against otherwise identical cells made from virgin sourced metals.
On
January 20, 2021 the US DOE issued a public release that ABTC had been selected for award negotiation for a three-year project with a
total budget of $4.5 million for the field demonstration of its selective leaching, targeted purification, and electro-chemical production
of battery grade lithium hydroxide from domestic claystone resources technology. Through this grant award ABTC is eligible to receive
reimbursement of up to 50% of eligible expenditures, or up to $2.3 million. The prime agreement contract for this grant (“AMO grant”)
was issued with a project start date of October 1, 2021
The
Company recognizes approved funds under these awards as an offset to specific R&D programs. As mentioned in the notes to the financial
statement, the Company accounts for these awards under ASU No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance.” The Company recognizes qualified
expenditures and their respective government assistance and nets the funds received against the total cost incurred to arrive at a net
expenditure per period. The Company believes this best reflects the continued investment in R&D along with the assistance of financial
government assistance. The amounts below represent the funds received by the Company from Government entities.

$36,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The
Company recognized a gain of approximately $99,000 related to the sale of mining claims it previously held in Railroad Valley, NV during
the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Net
Loss
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $8.6 million or ($0.01) loss per share compared to a net loss
of $24.1 million or ($0.04) loss per share during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $11.4
million and total assets of $47.6 million compared to cash of $29.0 million and total assets of $52.9 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease
in cash is due to the Company’s continued investment in its Pilot Plant in Fernley, NV and its $8.2 million acquisition of mineral
properties in Tonopah, NV. The Company continues to increase its efforts in key areas such as R&D and exploration activities.
The Company had total liabilities of $1.7 million
at December 31, 2022, compared to $3.2 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in total liabilities is largely due to the timing of construction
costs incurred at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital
of $12.1 million compared to a working capital of $26.8 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in working capital is primarily attributed
to the acquisition of mineral rights, equipment and construction costs related to its Pilot Plant, increased R&D expenditures and
additional payroll-related costs for increased headcount for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Cash
Flows
Cash
from Operating Activities.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company used $7.4 million of cash for operating activities as compared to $4.3 million during the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was due to an increase in payroll-related expenditures, namely in research and
development. The Company held its first shareholder meeting which has its administrative costs during the period ended December 31, 2022.
The Company has also seen a steady increase in exploration activity expenses as it continues to evaluate its claims in the Tonopah, NV
region.
Cash
from Investing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company used cash of approximately $10.2 million, including $8.0 million for the acquisition of mineral rights in Tonopah, NV and $2.2
million towards construction and equipment costs for its initial lithium-ion battery recycling Pilot Plant. This is in comparison to the
acquisition costs of $7.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, consisting primarily of $5.1 million of construction and
equipment and $2.2 million of water rights to support the Company’s Pilot Plant operations.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on
a timely basis.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, our management
concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting was deemed not to be effective, based on the
criteria therein. Material weaknesses presiding over our internal controls as it relates to financial reporting are described below.
Material
Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
did not maintain adequate documentation evidencing the operating effectiveness of certain control activities and did not maintain proper
levels of supervision and review of complex accounting matters. We did not maintain appropriate segregation of duties related to accounting
processes.
These
material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis, and we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022.
Remediation
Plan
We
continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses presented in our financial statements
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. We are committed to ensuring that our internal control over financial reporting is
designed and operating effectively.
○
Successful hiring of additional
personnel with the expertise necessary to improve the financial reporting function
○
Complete the implementation
of SAP ByDesign, an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will provide the necessary permissions and roles to mitigate
control weaknesses in key accounting processes and procedures
○
Provide additional guidance,
education and training to employees relating to our accounting procedures with a continued focus on its segregation-of-duties as
the Company hires more accounting personnel
○
Further develop and document
detailed accounting policies for significant accounts, accounting estimates and presentation of complex items, as is required by
US GAAP
○
Establishing effective
general controls over IT systems to ensure that information produced can be relied upon by process level controls
○
We have engaged a firm
that specializes in Cyber and IT protection to further enhance the protection of our financial information, employee information,
proprietary methods, and strategic partnerships

Remediation
Plan (Continued)
We expect to remediate our
material weaknesses during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. However, there is no guarantee that such material weaknesses will be
remediated during the year, and we may discover additional material weaknesses that may require additional time and resources to remediate.
