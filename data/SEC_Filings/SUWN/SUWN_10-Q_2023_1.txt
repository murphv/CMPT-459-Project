We sell stevioside, a natural sweetener, and other pharmaceutical productions, such as Metformin. Substantially all of our operations are located in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). We have built an integrated company with the sourcing and production capabilities designed to meet the needs of our customers. Our operations are organized into two operating segments related to our product lines:

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sunwin and all our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim financial reporting. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results for the periods presented. Certain financial statement amounts relating to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes for the year ended April 30, 2022 included in our Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. The results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows which may be reported for future periods or the full fiscal year.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2022 contained herein has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of April 30, 2022, but do not include all disclosures required by the U.S. GAAP.
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sunwin and all our wholly-owned subsidiaries included in operations and discontinued operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Qufu Shengwang is the subsidiary with discontinued operations and our subsidiaries for operations include the following:
- 5 -
-     Qufu Natural Green;
-     Qufu Shengren;
-     Sunwin USA; and
-     Qufu Shengren Import and Export
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets and valuation of deferred tax assets, and the value of stock-based compensation.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash includes cash on hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable and other receivable are reported at net realizable value. We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible after exhaustive efforts on collection. We had no bad debt expense for allowance of doubtful accounts during the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. The balances for allowance of doubtful accounts were $ 72,090
and $ 79,886
on October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, consisting of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods related to our products, are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value that can be estimated utilizing the weighted moving average method. Adjustments are recorded to write down the carrying amount of any obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value. We continually evaluate the recoverability based on assumptions about future customer demand and market conditions. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, the Company will record a write down of inventories for the difference between the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. In the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company wrote down inventories of $ 56,435
and $ 653,505 , respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which range from two to thirty years. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. In accordance with paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), we examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.
The residual value rate and useful life of property and equipment are summarized as follows:
Property and Equipment
Residual value rate
Useful life
Office equipment
10% or 5% or 0%
3-15 years
Auto and trucks
10% or 5% or 0%

Included in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consisted of factory improvements and machinery pending installation and included the costs of construction, machinery and equipment, and or any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation of the assets if applicable. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In accordance with ASC 360, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, intangible assets, and land use rights, for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates. Based on our evaluation, we have determined certain long-lived assets that are no longer useful for our operations, and we recorded a gain from disposition of property and equipment of $ 423
in the six months ended October 31, 2022 but we recorded a loss on disposition of property and equipment of $ 386,687
in the six months ended October 31, 2021.
LAND USE RIGHTS
According to the law of PRC, the government owns all the land in the PRC. Companies or individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only through land use rights granted by the Chinese government for a specified period of time. Land use rights are being amortized using the straight-line method over the periods the rights are granted.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We adopted ASC Section 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. ASC Section 820-10-35-37 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC Section 820-10-35-37 did not have an impact on our financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.
ASC Section 820-10-35-37 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Section 820-10-35-37 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2:
Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.
The carrying amounts of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, prepayments and other current assets, accounts payable, taxes payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
TAXES PAYABLE
We are required to charge for and to collect value added taxes (VAT) on our sales on behalf of the PRC tax authority. We record VAT that we billed our customers as VAT payable. In addition, we are required to pay value added taxes on our primary purchases. We record VAT that is charged by our vendors as VAT receivable. We are required to file VAT return on a monthly basis with the PRC tax authority, in which we are entitled to claim the VAT that we are charged by vendors as VAT credit and these credits can be applied to our VAT payable that we billed our customers. Accordingly, these VAT payable and receivable are presented as net amounts for financial statement purposes. Taxes payable as of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022 amounted to $ 684,759
and $ 812,545 , respectively, consisted primarily of VAT taxes.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Pursuant to the guidance of ASC 606, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenues from the sale of stevia and other productions upon shipment and transfer of title based on the trade terms. All product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the products. We report revenues net of applicable sales taxes and related surcharges.   The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identify the contract with a customer;
•
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determine the transaction price;
•
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company is also a lessor, which is an entity that is lease underlying asset to the third party, The Company’s lease revenue is recognized under ASC Topic 842, Leases, (“ASC 842”), which was adopted on May 1, 2019. In general, the Company commences rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. The Company’s lease has been accounted for as operating lease. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease of five years. Actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may have been higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period. The difference by which straight-line rental revenue exceeded rents billed in accordance with lease agreements is recorded as “accounts receivable”. The difference by which rents billed in accordance with lease agreements exceeded straight-line rental revenue is recorded as “advances from customer”. The Company does not offset lease income and lease expense.
GRANT INCOME
Grants received from PRC government agencies are recognized as deferred grant income and recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as and when they are earned for the specific research and development projects for which these grants are designated for.
INCOME TAXES
The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10,
Income Taxes
("ASC 740-10") which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that it is more likely than not be realized.
We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States for our corporate operations pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and file separate foreign tax returns for our Chinese subsidiaries pursuant to the China's Unified Corporate Income Tax Law.
We apply the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes", which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company's liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company's results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Pursuant to ASC Section 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the income of ours, subject to anti-dilution limitations. The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per common share:

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Transactions and balances originally denominated in U.S. dollars are presented at their original amounts. Transactions and balances in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC Section 830-20-35 and are included in determining net income or loss.
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the parent company is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of the Company's operating subsidiaries is the Chinese Renminbi ("RMB").  In accordance with ASC 830-20-35, the consolidated financial statements were translated into United States dollars using balance sheet date rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for the income statements and cash flows. Equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations.  Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other comprehensive income or loss.
RMB is not a fully convertible currency. All foreign exchange transactions involving RMB must take place either through the People's Bank of China (the "PBOC") or other institutions authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange. The exchange rate adopted for the foreign exchange transactions are the rates of exchange quoted by the PBOC, which are determined largely by supply and demand. Translation of amounts from RMB into United States dollars ("$") was made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:
As of October 31, 2022
RMB

and $ 792,367
for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, and $ 1,204,752

and $ 50,088
for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company uses the "management approach" in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal organization and reporting used by the Company's chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source for determining the Company's reportable segments. The Company's chief operating decision maker has been identified as the chief executive officer of the Company who reviews financial information of separate operating segments based on U.S. GAAP. The chief operating decision maker now reviews results analyzed by customer. This analysis is only presented at the revenue level with no allocation of direct or indirect costs. Consequently, the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU provides an exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting company. For all other entities, the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-13 has been amended by ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, and ASU 2019-11. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU No. 2016-13, the effective dates and transition methodology for ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, and ASU 2019-11 are the same as the effective dates and transition methodology in ASU 2016-13. The Company did not adopt this standard yet due to the status of smaller reporting company. We plan to adopt this standard for the year beginning May 1, 2023. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, we have not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our consolidated financial statements.

GOING CONCERN
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern.  The Company has incurred recurring losses with a net loss of approximately $260,000 and $454,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 and has a significant accumulated deficit of $46.6 million as of October 31, 2022. The Company's cash balance and revenues generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the date of this report. These factors raise doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management's plans include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely basis, obtain additional working capital funds through debt and equity financings, and restructure on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to raise cash balance in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. Management intends to make every effort to identify and develop sources of funds.  The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time.  There can be no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and raise additional capital. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amount or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 - NONCONTROLLING INTEREST
Noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets resulted from the consolidation of Shengren, a 61.3% owned subsidiary starting from April 30, 2020. An individual investor and Shandong Yulong Mining Group Co., Ltd. (“Yulong”) hold 38.4% and 0.3% of the equity interest in Shengren effective at the end of date, April 30, 2020, respectively, pursuant to a series of debt transfer and conversion agreements entered into on April 30, 2020 between seven individual creditors and three suppliers, an individual investor with Yulong and Qufu Shengren.

(iii)    Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. We place our cash with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States and the PRC. As of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, we had $2,707,425 and $293,408 of cash balance held in PRC banks, respectively. PRC banks protect consumers against loss if their bank or thrift institution fails, and each of our PRC bank account is insured up to RMB500,000 (approximately $68,000). As a result, cash held in PRC financial institutions of $2,548,462 and $119,250 are not insured as of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts through October 31, 2022. Our cash position by geographic area was as follows:
Country:

Total cash and cash equivalents

$ 321,193

Almost all of our sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, we believe that the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to generally short payment terms. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to help further reduce potential credit risk.
NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on our evaluation, no other event has occurred requiring adjustment or disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the preceding unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes and our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
OVERVIEW
We sell stevioside, a natural sweetener. Stevioside is a natural zero calorie sweetener extracted from the leaf of the stevia plants. Substantially all of our operations are located in the PRC. We have built an integrated company with the production and distribution capabilities designed to meet the needs of our customers.
Our operations were organized in two operating segments related to our product lines:
-
Stevioside, and
-
Corporate and other.
Going Concern
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has a significant accumulated deficit and incurred recurring losses. The Company's cash balance and revenues generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the date of this report. These factors raise doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management's plans include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely basis, obtain additional working capital funds through debt and equity financings, and restructure on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to raise cash balance in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. Management intends to make every effort to improve its current sales forecast to further develop and expand the international markets for its new products as well as continuing with the current sources of funds to meet working capitals needs on as needed basis.  There can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be successful.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and raise additional capital. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amount or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Recent Developments
Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the Company’s business operations, financial condition and operating results for 2023, including but not limited to material negative impact to the Company’s total revenues, production capability, ability to conduct marketing and sales, and slower collection of accounts receivables. We are able to maintain certain income from previous existing orders and finished products, however, we believe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will be most significant in our raw material purchasing and our sales. Due to the effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the sourcing and availability of stevia raw material will have increased difficulties and costs for fiscal 2023.
We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and taking steps in an effort to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and the governmental and community reactions thereto. We continue to assess and update our business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic, including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforces healthy and safe. We are also working with our suppliers to understand the existing and future negative impacts, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic is developing, the global breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact; therefore, any negative impact on our overall financial and operating results (including without limitation our liquidity) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our financial and operating results.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Our revenues totaled approximately $7,403,000 during the three months ended October 31, 2022, a decrease of 26.8%, as compared with the same period in 2021, and our gross margin increased to 17.2% from (0.7)%. Our total operating expenses in the three months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $286,000, or 16.8% compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease of approximately $121,000, or 31.9% in selling expense, a decrease of approximately $142,000, or 26.9% in general and administrative expense and a decrease of approximately $23,000, or 2.9% in research and development expenses. Our net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2022 was approximately $260,000, compared to a net loss $1,893,000 in the same period in 2021.
Our revenues totaled approximately $15,113,000 during the six months ended October 31, 20221, a decrease of 7.7%, as compared with the same period in 2021, and our gross margin increased to 16.1% from 5.0%. Our total operating expenses in the six months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $193,000, or 6.8% compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease of approximately $91,000, or 12.1% in selling expense, a decrease of approximately $159,000, or 16.9% in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $57,000, or 4.9% in research and development expenses. Our net loss for the six months ended October 31, 2022 was approximately $454,000, compared to a net loss of $2,643,000 in six months ended October 31, 2021.
While we have broadened our stevia product offerings to include a number of higher quality stevia grades needed in new product formulations we are developing to introduce to the U.S. and European food and beverage industry, the demand for higher grade stevia products has yet to materialize to the degree we had anticipated, and we hope that our sales volume in higher grade stevia products will increase in fiscal 2023 as demand resumes and increases after the effects of the global pandemic. Stevia has become more widely accepted by the food industry and many new stevia manufacturers have entered this industry in the past few years; recently we have introduced a new product line. We are now focusing on new types of stevia products, including tablets, liquid, High A products, and others. We expect to consistently increase our sales of our new products; however, we cannot quantify this increase and its effects on future periods.
Our Outlook
We believe that there are significant opportunities for worldwide growth in our Stevioside segment, not only in the U.S. and EU markets but also in our domestic market. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and beyond, we will continue to focus on our core business of producing and selling stevioside series products.
Currently there is a world-wide movement of lowering sugar intake, and more and more consumers are becoming aware of the health benefits associated with reduction of sugar intake. According to research data, 40% of Chinese consumers stated that they "will not mind paying more for food and beverages with more natural ingredients" and 80% of the interview consumers express a goal of "having a healthier diet". We believe that, in this search of a more natural and healthy diet and lifestyle, natural sweeteners such as stevia will become the mainstream sweetener in the food and beverage markets.
Some of the recent favorable observations related to the stevia markets include:
-
Chinese domestic food and beverages, particularly herbal tea manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, have increased the use of steviosides, and new health awareness trends have also resulted in some new governing laws supporting the growth of this industry;
-
Southeast and South Asia have renewed and increased their interest in stevia, particularly high grade stevia;
-
New global product launches mentioning stevia have increased 13% per year on average from 2014 to 2018; and
-
Stevia has been growing in popularity in the last 10 years throughout all the global markets.
Meanwhile, we are also facing challenges in competitive pricing and raw materials for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as negative impact from the global COVID-19 pandemic. During the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, the market prices of stevioside products continue to be impacted by strong price competition among Chinese manufacturers. With this being a product gaining large market shares in China, in the recent years we have seen many competitors entering the market. These new competitors use lower pricing as their effort to gain market share as they initially entering the market, thus driving down the average prices for stevia products. We expect the pressure from pricing competition to continue in fiscal 2023. We anticipate the price of stevia leaves, the raw material used to produce our stevioside series products, will also continue to increase in fiscal 2023 since the demand for raw material may increase as the market grows, while the production of the raw material experiences negative impact due to the global pandemic.
- 18 -
We intend to make adjustments internally in order to better operate in this market; our goal is to increase sales and develop new client bases through our marketing effort, decrease our production expenses while maintaining the stability and quality of our products, and decrease our overall expenditures. We believe while there are challenges and risks in this market, our high quality high grade product and the formulations developed by our internal research and development team differentiates us from other competitors and our efforts will lead to sustainable growth in the future.

Revenues
Total revenues in the three months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by approximately 26.8%, as compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to a decreasing demand from domestic and international markets during COVID-19 pandemic. Our Stevioside segment, revenues from sales decreased by 27.0%, from 98.9% to 98.7% of our total revenues in the three months ended October 31, 2022.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin
Cost of revenues in the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by 39.8% and 18.5%, compared to the same period in 2021, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from 100.7% and 95.0% to 82.8% and 83.9% during the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, respectively. Gross margin in Stevioside segment increased from (1.2)% to 16.7% for the three months ended by October 31, 2022, compared the same period in 2021. Gross margin in Stevioside segment increased from 4.3% to 15.5% for the six months ended by October 31, 2022, compared the same period in 2021, which was primarily due improvements in the management of our production process, we were able to operate with better efficiency and reduce the cost of production, as well as an increase in our sales prices.
Our unit sale price fluctuated from month to month in the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, which was mainly affected by the market environment; the average unit sales price of our stevia products has increased for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. We are facing challenges in competitive pricing and sourcing of raw materials, and the market prices of stevioside products were impacted by strong price competition among Chinese manufacturers. We also anticipate the price of stevia leaves, the raw material used to produce our stevioside series products, to continue to increase in the near future. In the six months ended October 31, 2022, some of our stevia products, such as A3-95 and A3-80, were sold for a loss in order to avoid further losses resulting from spoilage of overstocked inventory.
- 20 -
We believe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant in our raw material purchasing and our sales. Due to the effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the sourcing and availability of stevia raw material will have increased difficulties and costs for fiscal 2023. February to March is normally the nursing period for stevia plants; as a result of COVID-19 related gathering laws, farmers are not able to have the same amount of nursery workers as previous years, resulting in a decrease of stevia plants, and relevant safety measures also resulted in an increase of general planting costs. We expect this to cause a shortage of stevia leaves harvest this year and along with the effect of the rain seasons, we expect to see an increase in our cost of raw material. After we resumed production, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation has also made it difficult for us to efficiently procure our raw materials.
Selling Expenses
For the three months ended October 31, 2022, we had a decrease of approximately $121,000, or 31.9% in selling expenses, as compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the approximately $107,000 decrease in promotion and marketing expenses, $31,000 decrease in commission expenses, $12,000 decrease in shipping and freight and $2,000 decrease in hospitality expenses, offset by $23,000 increase in office expenses and $8,000 increase in local sales taxes in the three months ended October 31, 2022.
For the six months ended October 31, 2022, we had a decrease of approximately $91,000, or 12.1% in selling expenses, as compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the approximately $121,000 decrease in promotion and marketing expenses, $24,000 decrease in commission expenses, $20,000 decrease in travel expenses, $8,000 decrease in shipping and freight and $2,000 decrease in hospitality expenses, offset by $63,000 increase in local sales taxes and $21,000 increase in salary expenses in the six months ended October 31, 2022.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $142,000, or 26.9% from the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $78,000 in repairs and maintenance fees, $3,000 decrease in consulting service and auditing fees, $26,000 decrease in hospitality expenses, $11,000 decrease in travel expenses, $34,000 decrease in salary expenses and $23,000 decrease in safety production fund, offset by an increase of approximately $7,000 increase in office expenses and $26,000 increase in miscellaneous expense in the three months ended October 31, 2022.
Our general and administrative expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $159,000, or 16.9% from the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $76,000 in repairs and maintenance fees, $11,000 decrease in consulting service and auditing fees, $31,000 decrease in hospitality expenses, $13,000 decrease in travel expenses, $38,000 decrease in salary expenses and $15,000 decrease in safety production fund, offset by an increase of approximately $19,000 increase in office expenses and $6,000 increase in miscellaneous expense in the six months ended October 31, 2022.
Research and Development Expenses
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, our research and development expenses amounted to approximately $769,000 and $1,205,000, respectively, as compared to $792,000 and $1,148,000 for the same period in 2021. The changes were primarily due to the changes in materials used for R&D purpose in the three and six months ended October 31, 2022.
Other Income (Expenses)
For the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, other expense, net of other income, amounted to approximately $123,000, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2022, other expense, net of other income, amounted to approximately $241,000, a decrease of $376,000 as compared to the other expense, net of other income, amounted to approximately $617,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2021. The decrease of other expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in other expenses of $443,000 attributable to a loss on disposition of property and equipment in the six months ended October 31, 2021, and a decrease of approximately $143,000 in interest expense to related parties, offset by a decrease of $1,000 in interest income and an increase of $210,000 in interest expense to third parties.

Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, our loss amounted $260,000 and $454,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, as compared with net loss of $1,893,000 and $2,643,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, a decrease of $1,633,000, or 86.3% and a decrease of $2,189,000, or 82.8%. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to decreased operating expenses and decreased other expenses, as well as increased gross profit in the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2021.
Net Loss Attributable to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc.
Our net loss attributable to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc. in the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 was approximately $218,000 and $339,000, or $(0.00) and (0.00) per share (basic and diluted), compared to $1,169,000 and $1,629,000, or $(0.01) and (0.01) per share (basic and diluted), in the three and six months ended October 31, 2021.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest
Noncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests an individual investor and Shangdong Yulong Mining Group Co., Ltd. ("Yulong") hold in Qufu Shengren. The amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss is computed by multiplying the after-tax loss by 38.7%, the percentage ownership in Qufu Shengren not directly attributable to us.  Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to $42,000 and $114,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022, compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $724,000 and $1,014,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2021.
Foreign Currency Translation Gain
The functional currency of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ("RMB"). The financial statements of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange translations are included in the Comprehensive loss on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As a result of foreign currency translations attributable to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc., which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of $208,000 and $274,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022. We reported a foreign currency translation gain of $40,000 and $46,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. These non-cash loss and gain had the effect of our reported comprehensive loss.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to meet its operational cash requirements.
On October 31, 2022, we had working capital deficit of approximately $5,404,000, including cash of approximately $2,774,000, as compared to working deficit of $5,949,000, including cash of approximately $321,000 at April 30, 2022. The approximate $2,453,000 increase in our cash at October 31, 2022 from April 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $3,363,000, offset by net cash used in investing activities of approximately $162,000, net cash used in financing activities of approximately $560,000 and effect of exchange rate on cash of $188,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2022. The Company's cash balance and revenues generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the date of this report. These factors raise doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management's plans include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely basis, obtain additional working capital funds through debt and equity financings, and restructure on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to raise cash balance in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. Management intends to make every effort to improve its current sales force as to further develop and expand the international markets for its new products as well as continuing with the current sources of funds to meet working capital needs on as needed basis.  There can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be successful.

The COVID-19 Pandemic.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" and on March 10, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus include restrictions on travel, quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. The coronavirus and actions taken to mitigate it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical areas in China in which the Company operates. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the Company’s business operations, financial condition and operating results for 2022 and 2023, including but not limited to material negative impact to the Company’s total revenues, slower collection of accounts receivables and significant impairment to the Company’s equity investments. Due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time.

The majority of our cash balances on October 31, 2022 are in the form of RMB stored in a bank account in China. Cash held in banks in the PRC is not insured. The value of cash on deposit in mainland China of approximately $2,707,000 as of October 31, 2022 has been converted based on the exchange rate as of October 31, 2022. In 1996, the Chinese government introduced regulations, which relaxed restrictions on the conversion of the RMB; however, restrictions still remain, including but not limited to restrictions on foreign invested entities. Foreign invested entities may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents at only those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchanges. Furthermore, the conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investments and loans, is subject to PRC government approval. Chinese entities are required to establish and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, cash on deposit in banks in the PRC is not readily deployable by us for use outside of China.
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts increased by approximately $531,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2022, as a result of the increase in sales of product sold as of October 31, 2022. The days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased to 93 days as of October 31, 2022, as compared to 80 days as of April 30, 2022. We will reevaluate and categorize accounts receivable for sales and will target to improve our collection effort in fiscal 2023.
- 23 -
Inventories on October 31, 2022, net of reserve for obsolescence, totaled approximately $2,194,000, as compared to $5,564,000 as of April 30, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to our increase in higher sales volume during the six months ended October 31, 2022. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
there has been minimal disruption in our supply chain network of certain raw materials.
We are not able to purchase enough leaves of the stevia to meet our anticipated upcoming increase in demands
Our accounts payable and accrued expenses were approximately $13,282,000 on October 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $1,067,000 from April 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to our increase in procurements of raw material as a result of the rising sales of such materials during the six months ended October 31, 2022.
Loans payable on October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022 totaled approximately $4,321,000 and $4,908,000, respectively. These loans payable consisted of short-term loans from multiple non-related individuals, which bear annual interest rates of 4% - 12%.  Range of maturity dates of the loans payable was from January 8, 2023 to November 30, 2023.  During the six months ended October 31, 2022, the Company repaid loans in amount of approximately $560,000 in cash.
Due to related parties on October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022 totaled approximately $4,417,000 and $4,882,000, respectively.  As of October 31, 2022, the balance we owed Pharmaceutical Corporation and Mr. Weidong Chai, a management member of Qufu Shengren Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., amounted to approximately $4,191,000 and $226,000, respectively. On April 30, 2022, the balance we owed to Pharmaceutical Corporation and Export and Mr. Weidong Chai amounted to approximately $4,646,000 and $236,000, respectively.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us as a party, under which we have:
-
Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts,
-
Any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,
-
Any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to our stock and classified in stockholder's equity in our statement of financial position, and
-
Any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP").
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not applicable to smaller reporting company.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2022.
Based on this evaluation our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2022 such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Section 404"). As reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022 and, during our assessment, management identified significant deficiencies related to (i) the U.S. GAAP expertise of our internal accounting staff, (ii) our internal audit functions and (iii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. Although management believes that these deficiencies do not amount to a material weakness, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at April 30, 2022.
Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. As a result, we have not been able to take steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the six months ended October 31, 2022. However, to the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals.
A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company's financial reporting.
In light of this significant deficiency, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our consolidated financial statements for the six months ended October 31, 2022 included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our significant deficiency, our consolidated financial statements for the six months ended October 31, 2022 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the six months ended October 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
