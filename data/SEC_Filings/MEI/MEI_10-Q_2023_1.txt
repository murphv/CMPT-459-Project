NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
Note 1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of business Methode Electronics, Inc. (the “Company” or “Methode”) is a leading global supplier of custom engineered solutions with sales, engineering and manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The Company designs, engineers and produces mechatronic products for Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) utilizing its broad range of technologies for user interface, light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting system, power distribution and sensor applications.
The Company’s solutions are found in the end markets of transportation (including automotive, commercial vehicle, e-bike, aerospace, bus and rail), cloud computing infrastructure, construction equipment, consumer appliance and medical devices.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conditions The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing measures to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer and customer demand and global supply chains, and resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and increased freight costs due to global capacity constraints. As a result of a resurgence of the virus in China and corresponding government lock-down orders, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the Company's China operations in fiscal 2023. The Company was also negatively impacted by the effect these developments had on the Company’s Asian customers. Future resurgences of the COVID-19 virus or its variants in China or other regions, including corresponding lock-downs or similar government orders, could impact the Company's results of operations.
Various government programs have been enacted to provide assistance to businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount of assistance the Company received was $ 0.3
million and $ 3.1
million in the three months ended
January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 , respectively. The Company received $ 4.6
million and $ 7.1
million in the
nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively. Government assistance has been reported as other income. The Company continues to experience increased material and logistics costs, labor shortages, and impacts from the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage is due, in part, to increased demand across multiple industries, including the automotive industry, resulting in a slowdown in production schedules. The semiconductor supply shortage is also impacting the Company’s supply chain and its ability to meet demand at some of its non-automotive customers. The supply chain challenges continue to negatively impact working capital. The Russia-Ukraine military conflict has negatively impacted the Company's European customers and suppliers. Although the Company does not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, certain of its customers and suppliers have been negatively impacted by these events, which in turn has impacted markets where the Company conducts business, including Europe and Asia. The economic sanctions imposed by the international community have further increased existing supply chain, logistics, and inflationary challenges. Basis of presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed) that management believes are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 23, 2022. Results may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons other than seasonality. Financial reporting periods The Company maintains its financial records on the basis of a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. The three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022
were both
13 -week periods, and the nine months ended
January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022
were both
39 -week periods. 9
Table of Contents   Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Summary of significant accounting policies The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies in the nine months ended January 28, 2023 . New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10, “ Government Assistance (Topic 832) ,” which requires annual disclosures when an entity has received government assistance. This guidance is intended to improve the transparency of government assistance received by requiring disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on the registrant’s financial statements. The Company will adopt this standard effective April 29, 2023 and expects the standard to only impact annual financial statement footnote disclosures.
Note 2.
Revenue The Company generates revenue from the manufacturing of products for customers in diversified global markets. The substantial majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time. The Company has determined that the most definitive demonstration that control of the product has transferred to a customer is physical shipment or delivery, depending on the contractual shipping terms, except for consignment transactions. Consignment transactions are arrangements where the Company transfers product to a customer location but retains ownership and control of the product until it is used by the customer. Revenue for consignment arrangements is recognized upon the customer’s usage. Revenue associated with products which the Company believes have no alternative use (such as highly customized parts), and where the Company has an enforceable right to payment, are recognized on an over time basis. Revenue is recognized based on progress to date, which is typically even over the production process through transfer of control to the customer. From time to time, customers may negotiate annual price downs. Management has evaluated these price downs and determined that in some instances, these price downs give rise to a material right. In instances that a material right exists, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the material right and recognized over the life of the contract. Across all products, the amount of revenue recognized corresponds to the related purchase order and is adjusted for variable consideration (such as discounts) and ongoing price adjustments. Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company’s performance obligations are typically short-term in nature. As a result, the Company has elected the practical expedient that provides an exemption from the disclosure requirements regarding information about remaining performance obligations on contracts that have original expected durations of one year or less. Contract balances A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. A contract liability exists when an entity has received consideration, or the amount is due from the customer in advance of revenue recognition. The net changes in the contract asset and contract liability balances for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 were not material. 10
Table of Contents   Disaggregated revenue information The following table represents a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers by segment and geographical location. Net sales are attributed to regions based on the location of production. Though revenue recognition patterns and contracts are generally consistent, the amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows may vary in each reportable segment due to geographic and economic factors.

Note 3. Restructuring The Company continually monitors market factors and industry trends and takes restructuring actions to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability as appropriate. Restructuring actions generally result in charges for employee termination benefits, plant closures, asset impairments and contract termination costs. In the nine months ended January 28, 2023, the Company recognized $ 0.4
million of asset impairment charges related to a facility shutdown and consolidation into an existing location. In the nine months ended January 29, 2022, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate one of its operations within the Industrial segment in response to logistics issues and tariffs. This action resulted in a facility shutdown and consolidation of activities into an existing location. The Company recognized $ 3.1
million of restructuring costs associated with this restructuring plan.
Employee termination benefits are accrued upon the commitment to a termination plan and when the benefit arrangement is communicated to affected employees, or when liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Asset impairment charges relate to the impairment of right-of-use lease assets and equipment.

The Company's restructuring liability was $ 0.0
million and $ 0.1
million as of
January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022 , respectively. Estimates of restructuring costs are based on information available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring costs, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded. Accordingly, the Company may record revisions of previous estimates by adjusting previously established accruals.
Note 4.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for an interim period is based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate applied to ordinary year-to-date earnings or losses. The estimated annual effective income tax rate is determined excluding the effects of unusual or significant one-time items that are reported net of the related tax effects in the period in which they occur. In addition, any material effects of enacted tax law or rate changes as well as the Company’s ability to utilize various tax assets is recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The computation of the estimated annual effective income tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected pre-tax income (or loss) for the year by jurisdiction, certain book to tax adjustments, and the likelihood of the realizability of deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or as the Company’s tax environment changes.

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates and research deductions claimed in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 29, 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the reversal of valuation allowances related to certain loss carryforwards and income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates. The Company’s gross unrecognized income tax benefits were $ 5.3
million and $ 5.1
million as of
January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022 , respectively. If any portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is recognized, it would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, such as tax audits, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations and changes in tax law. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 0.4
million and $ 0.2
million as of
January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was enacted in the United States. The IR Act imposes a
1 % excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year. The amount of excise tax accrued for repurchases made in January 2023 was immaterial. Further, the remaining corporate tax changes included in the IR Act are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note 5. Balance Sheet Components Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Highly liquid investments include money market funds which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022 , the Company had a balance of $ 60.7
million and $ 40.0
million, respectively, in money market accounts.
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the current expected credit loss impairment model. The Company applies a historical loss rate based on historic write-offs to aging categories. The historical loss rate is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future losses as necessary. The Company may also record a specific reserve for individual accounts when it becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 1.3
million and $ 1.0
million as of
January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Finished products and work-in-process inventories include direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs. The Company records reserves for inventory that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future market demand.

Pre-production tooling costs related to long-term supply arrangements The Company incurs pre-production tooling costs related to products produced for its customers under long-term supply arrangements. Engineering, testing and other costs incurred in the design and development of production parts are expensed as incurred, unless the costs are reimbursable by the customer. As of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company had $ 30.8
million and $ 27.2
million, respectively, of pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has provided a non-cancelable right to use the tooling.
Costs for molds, dies and other tools used in products produced for its customers under long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has title are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and amortized over the shorter of the life of the arrangement or the estimated useful life of the assets. As of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022 , Company-owned tooling was $ 12.4
million and $ 14.6
million, respectively.

The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year. In addition, the Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions used in determining fair value and therefore require interim goodwill impairment testing, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability, discount rates, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rates and market interest rates. The Company strives to control its exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities and, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
For a designated cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedged transaction is realized, the gain or loss previously included in AOCI is recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded immediately in the condensed consolidated statements of income on the same line as the associated risk. For a designated net investment hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 15
Table of Contents   Net investment hedges The Company has a variable-rate, cross-currency swap, maturing on
August 31, 2023 , with a notional value of $ 60.0
million (€ 54.8
million). The Company entered into the cross-currency swap to mitigate changes in net assets due to changes in U.S. dollar-euro spot exchange rates. The cross-currency swap is designated as a hedge of the Company’s net investment in a euro-based subsidiary.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly thereafter, under the spot-to-spot method. The Company recognizes the impact of all other changes in fair value of the derivative, which represents the interest rate differential of the cross-currency swap, through interest expense. For the three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 , the Company recorded gains of $ 0.4
million and $ 0.1
million, respectively, in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income. For the
nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 , the Company recorded gains of $ 1.3
million and $ 0.2
million, respectively, in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
Interest rate swaps The Company has interest rate swaps, maturing on
August 31, 2023 , with a notional value of $ 100.0
million, to manage its exposure to, and to mitigate the impact of, interest rate variability. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly thereafter. The effective portion of the periodic changes in fair value is recognized in AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Subsequently, the accumulated gains and losses recorded in AOCI are reclassified to income in the period during which the hedged cash flow impacts earnings, which are expected to be immaterial over the next 12 months. No ineffectiveness was recognized in the three or nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022.
Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company uses short-term foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities, in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
As of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022 , the Company held foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of $ 107.6
million and $ 38.6
million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended
January 28, 2023 , the Company recognized a gain of $ 1.6
million and loss of $ 1.2
million, respectively, related to foreign currency forward contracts in the condensed consolidated statements of income. During the three and nine months ended
January 29, 2022 , a gain of $ 0.5
million and $ 0.7
million, respectively, was recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Fair value of derivative instruments on the balance sheet The fair value of derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are recorded in the balance sheets as follows:

Revolving credit facility/term loan On October 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the Lenders and other parties named therein. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 12, 2018 and as previously amended (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as L/C Issuer, and the Lenders named therein. Among other things, the Credit Agreement (i) increased the multicurrency revolving credit commitments under the Prior Credit Agreement to $ 750,000,000 , (ii) refinanced in full and terminated the term loan facility under the Prior Credit Agreement, and (iii) made certain other changes to the covenants, terms, and conditions under the Prior Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement permits the Company to increase the revolving commitments and/or add one or more tranches of term loans under the Credit Agreement from time to time by up to an amount equal to (i) $ 250,000,000
plus (ii) an additional amount so long as the leverage ratio would not exceed
3.00 :1.00 on a pro forma basis, subject to, among other things, the receipt of additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders. The Credit Agreement matures on
October 31, 2027 .
Loans denominated in US dollars under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (a) an adjusted base rate or (b) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) rate or term SOFR daily floating rate (in each case, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement) in each case plus an applicable rate (the “Applicable Rate”) ranging between
0.375 % and
1.25 %, in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and between
1.375 % and
2.25 %, in the case of adjusted term SOFR rate loans and term SOFR daily floating rate loans. Loans denominated in Euros will bear interest at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus an Applicable Rate ranging between
1.375 % and
2.25 %. The Applicable Rate is set based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $ 3.2
million which was capitalized and, along with the previous unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 0.6
million, is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.
The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement was approximately

Table of Contents   Stock-based compensation On September 14, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2022 Plan”). After that date, no further awards can be granted under the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”). The 2022 Plan provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance grants to employees and directors.
Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2022 Plan and the 2022 Plan’s share counting provisions,
the number of shares of the Company's common stock that will be available for all awards under the 2022 Plan is
5,550,000 , less
one
share for every one share of common stock subject to an option or SAR award granted after April 30, 2022 under the 2014 Plan and
2.28
shares for every one share that was subject to an award other than an option or SAR granted after April 30, 2022 under the 2014 Plan. As of
January 28, 2023 , there were
5,242,881
shares available for award under the 2022 Plan. The Company has granted stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), performance units (“PUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2022 Plan, the 2014 Plan, the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2010 Stock Plan (“2010 Plan”), the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2007 Stock Plan (“2007 Plan”) and the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan (“2004 Plan”). The Company can no longer make grants under the 2014 Plan, 2010 Plan, 2007 Plan and 2004 Plan.
Restricted stock awards and performance units
As of January 28, 2023 , the Company had
949,674
RSAs outstanding which may be earned based on the achievement of an earnings before net interest, taxes, fixed asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization (“EBITDA”) measure for fiscal 2025. The RSAs will vest ranging from
0 % (for performance below threshold) to
100 % (target performance) based on the achievement of the EBITDA performance measure and continued employment. In addition, if the target performance is exceeded, up to an additional
474,837
PUs can be earned that will be settled in cash. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, the PUs may be settled in shares of common stock. The fair value of the RSAs was based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and the RSAs earn dividend equivalents during the vesting period, which are forfeitable if the RSAs do not vest. Compensation expense for the RSAs is recognized when it is probable the minimum threshold performance criteria will be achieved. Compensation expense for the PUs is recognized when it is probable that the target performance criteria will be exceeded. The Company assesses the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjusts compensation costs based on the probability assessment. The cash-settled PUs represent a non-equity unit with a conversion value equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date. The PUs are classified as liability awards due to the cash settlement feature and are re-measured at each balance sheet date. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, based on projections of the Company’s current business portfolio, no compensation expense has been recognized for the RSAs or PUs to date, as the performance conditions are not probable of being met. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at target level of performance is $ 27.3
million as of
January 28, 2023, which, subject to the performance conditions being met, will be recognized through fiscal 2025. The following table summarizes RSA activity:

shares. Director awards The Company grants stock awards to its non-employee directors as a component of their compensation. The stock awards vest immediately upon grant.

43,179
shares, of which
27,639
shares were deferred. All dividends on deferred shares are reinvested into additional deferred shares based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the dividend payment date. Deferred shares will be settled with shares of common stock upon each director’s retirement from the Company’s Board of Directors. As of
January 28, 2023 , there were
45,594

The total intrinsic value of options exercised in the nine months ended January 28, 2023
was $ 0.4

Note 12. Contingencies Certain litigation arising in the normal course of business is pending against us. The Company is, from time-to-time, subject to various legal actions and claims incidental to our business, including those arising out of alleged defects, breach of contracts, employment-related matters, environmental matters and intellectual property matters. The Company considers insurance coverage and third-party indemnification when determining required accruals for pending litigation and claims. Although the outcome of potential legal actions and claims cannot be determined, it is the Company's opinion, based on the information available, that it has adequate reserves for these liabilities. Hetronic Germany-GmbH Matters	 For several years, Hetronic Germany-GmbH and Hydronic-Steuersysteme-GmbH (the “Fuchs companies”) served as our distributors for Germany, Austria and other central and eastern European countries pursuant to their respective intellectual property licenses and distribution and assembly agreements. The Company became aware that the Fuchs companies and their managing director, Albert Fuchs, had materially violated those agreements. As a result, the Company
terminated all of its agreements with the Fuchs companies. On June 20, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit against the Fuchs companies in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging material breaches of the distribution and assembly agreements and seeking damages, as well as various forms of injunctive relief. The defendants filed counterclaims alleging breach of contract, interference with business relations and business slander. On April 2, 2015, the Company amended its complaint against the Fuchs companies to add additional unfair competition and Lanham Act claims and to add additional affiliated parties.
A trial with respect to the matter began in February 2020. During the trial, the defendants dismissed their one remaining counterclaim with prejudice. On March 2, 2020, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company. The verdict included approximately $ 102
million in compensatory damages and $ 11
million in punitive damages. On April 22, 2020, the District Court entered a permanent injunction barring defendants from selling infringing products and ordering them to return Hetronic’s confidential information. Defendants appealed entry of the permanent injunction. On May 29, 2020, the District Court held defendants in contempt for violating the permanent injunction and entered the final judgment. Defendants appealed entry of the final monetary judgment as well. The appeal of the permanent injunction and the appeal of the final judgment were consolidated into a single appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On August 24, 2021, the Tenth Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court’s ruling with the exception that it instructed the District Court to modify the injunction from the entire world to all of the countries in which Hetronic sells its products. On April 20 and 21, 2022, the District Court held a hearing related to modifying the injunction pursuant to the Tenth Circuit’s opinion, and the parties have filed post-hearing briefs. The defendants also filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court seeking to further appeal the extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act in this case. The Company opposed that petition. The Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General on the petition for certiorari, and the Solicitor General recommended granting the petition. On November 4, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the petition. The Supreme Court appeal currently is set for argument on March 21, 2023. Like any judgment, particularly a judgment involving defendants outside of the United States, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to collect all or any portion of the judgment.
Note 13. Subsequent Events On February 28, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which it will launch a recommended public tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Nordic Lights Group Corporation (“Nordic Lights”), at an offer price of € 6.30
per share, for a total equity value of approximately € 132
million. Nordic Lights is a premium provider of high-quality lighting solutions for heavy-duty equipment and a public limited liability company incorporated in Finland with its shares admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Methode) of customary closing conditions for the acquisition of a public company in Finland, including, among others, (i) that the tender offer is irrevocably accepted by shareholders holding more than
90
percent of the shares and voting rights in Nordic Lights, which will enable the Company to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares in the capital of Nordic Lights under Finnish law, and (ii) the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed (including completion of the compulsory acquisition of Nordic Lights shares from any non-tendering minority) in the second half of calendar 2023.

Our solutions are found in the end markets of transportation (including automotive, commercial vehicle, e-bike, aerospace, bus and rail), cloud computing infrastructure, construction equipment, consumer appliance and medical devices. Our business is managed on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Industrial, Interface and Medical.
COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing measures to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer and customer demand and global supply chains, and resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and increased freight costs due to global capacity constraints. Beginning late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, various regions in China, including regions where we and our customers have operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in those areas. The resulting industry-wide production interruptions adversely impacted our results of operations in the nine months ended January 28, 2023.
Any future resurgence of COVID-19, and its related impacts, could negatively impact our business and future results of operations. The extent of the impact will depend on a number of evolving and uncertain factors, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 (and its variants), the rate of vaccinations, actions taken by governmental authorities to further restrict business operations and social activity and impose travel restrictions, shifting consumer demand, the ability of our supply chain to deliver in a timely and cost-effective manner, the ability of our employees and manufacturing facilities to operate efficiently and effectively, the continued viability and financial stability of our customers and suppliers and future access to capital. We continue to focus on effectively managing the unprecedented challenges and uncertainties of the pandemic on a global basis.
Global Supply Chain Disruptions
We continue to experience business interruptions, including customer shutdowns and increased material and logistics costs, labor shortages, and impacts from the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage is due, in part, to increased demand across multiple industries, including the automotive industry, resulting in a slowdown in production schedules. The semiconductor supply shortage is also impacting our supply chain and our ability to meet demand at some of our non-automotive customers. We expect this semiconductor shortage to have a continued impact on our operating results and financial condition for the remainder of fiscal 2023.
Impacts of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions
Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, wage and commodity inflation and currency fluctuations could adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, the Russia/Ukraine conflict has resulted in, among other things, economic sanctions imposed by the international community which have impacted the global economy and given rise to potential global security issues that may adversely affect international business and economic conditions. Although we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, certain of our customers and suppliers have been negatively impacted by these events, which in turn has impacted markets where we do business, including Europe and Asia. The economic sanctions imposed on Russia have further increased existing global supply chain, logistics, and inflationary challenges. For example, in response to the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries, Russia has reduced the volume of natural gas it sends to European countries, which has resulted in, and could continue to result in increased energy costs for our EMEA operations. If Russia further reduces or turns off energy supplies to Europe, our EMEA operations could be adversely affected.
Public Tender Offer of Nordic Lights
On February 28, 2023, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we will launch a recommended public tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Nordic Lights Group Corporation (“Nordic Lights”), at an offer price of €6.30 per share, for a total equity value of approximately €132 million. Nordic Lights is a premium provider of high-quality lighting solutions for heavy-duty equipment and a public limited liability company incorporated in Finland with its shares admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Methode) of customary closing conditions for the acquisition of a public company in Finland, including, among others, (i) that the tender offer is irrevocably accepted by shareholders holding more than 90 percent of the shares and voting rights in Nordic Lights, which will enable us to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares in the capital of Nordic Lights under Finnish law, and (ii) the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed (including completion of the compulsory acquisition of Nordic Lights shares from any non-tendering minority) in the second half of calendar 2023.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations, including capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as to fund debt service requirements, dividends and stock repurchases. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under our senior unsecured credit agreement. We believe our liquidity position will be sufficient to fund our existing operations and current commitments for at least the next twelve months. However, if economic conditions remain impacted for longer than we expect due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure or other geopolitical risks, including the Russia-Ukraine war, our liquidity position could be severely impacted.
As of January 28, 2023, we had $164.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $98.8 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. Cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund operational activities and can be repatriated, primarily through the payment of dividends and the repayment of intercompany loans, without creating material additional income tax expense.

As of January 28, 2023, a total of 2,598,653 shares have been purchased at a total cost of $110.8 million since the commencement of the share buyback program. As of January 28, 2023, the dollar value of shares that remained available to be purchased under this share buyback program was $89.2 million.
Credit Agreement
On October 31, 2022, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the Lenders and other parties named therein. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 12, 2018 and as previously amended (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as L/C Issuer, and the Lenders named therein. Among other things, the Credit Agreement (i) increased the multicurrency revolving credit commitments under the Prior Credit Agreement to $750,000,000, (ii) refinanced in full and terminated the term loan facility under the Prior Credit Agreement, and (iii) made certain other changes to the covenants, terms, and conditions under the Prior Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement permits us to increase the revolving commitments and/or add one or more tranches of term loans under the Credit Agreement from time to time by up to an amount equal to (i) $250,000,000 plus (ii) an additional amount so long as the leverage ratio would not exceed 3.00:1.00 on a pro forma basis, subject to, among other things, the receipt of additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders. The Credit Agreement matures on October 31, 2027.
As of January 28, 2023, $200.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of January 28, 2023.

The increase was due to an improvement in working capital, partially offset by lower net income adjusted for non-cash items.

Legal Matters
For several years, Hetronic Germany-GmbH and Hydronic-Steuersysteme-GmbH (the “Fuchs companies”) served as our distributors for Germany, Austria and other central and eastern European countries pursuant to their respective intellectual property licenses and distribution and assembly agreements. We became aware that the Fuchs companies and their managing director, Albert Fuchs, had materially violated those agreements. As a result, we terminated all of our agreements with the Fuchs companies. On June 20, 2014, we filed a lawsuit against the Fuchs companies in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging material breaches of the distribution and assembly agreements and seeking damages, as well as various forms of injunctive relief. The defendants filed counterclaims alleging breach of contract, interference with business relations and business slander. On April 2, 2015, we amended our complaint against the Fuchs companies to add additional unfair competition and Lanham Act claims and to add additional affiliated parties.
A trial with respect to the matter began in February 2020. During the trial, the defendants dismissed their one remaining counterclaim with prejudice. On March 2, 2020, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company. The verdict included approximately $102 million in compensatory damages and $11 million in punitive damages. On April 22, 2020, the District Court entered a permanent injunction barring defendants from selling infringing products and ordering them to return Hetronic’s confidential information. Defendants appealed entry of the permanent injunction. On May 29, 2020, the District Court held defendants in contempt for violating the permanent injunction and entered the final judgment. Defendants appealed entry of the final monetary judgment as well. The appeal of the permanent injunction and the appeal of the final judgment were consolidated into a single appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On August 24, 2021, the Tenth Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court’s ruling with the exception that it instructed the District Court to modify the injunction from the entire world to all of the countries in which Hetronic sells its products. On April 20 and 21, 2022, the District Court held a hearing related to modifying the injunction pursuant to the Tenth Circuit’s opinion, and the parties have filed post-hearing briefs. The defendants also filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court seeking to further appeal the extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act in this case. We opposed that petition. The Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General on the petition for certiorari, and the Solicitor General recommended granting the petition. On November 4, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the petition. The Supreme Court appeal currently is set for argument on March 21, 2023. Like any judgment, particularly a judgment involving defendants outside of the United States, there is no guarantee that we will be able to collect all or any portion of the judgment.
In the nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, we incurred Hetronic-related legal fees of $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These amounts are included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Industrial segment.
