NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
COMSovereign Holding Corp. (“COMSovereign”)
and subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”) a provider of solutions to network operators, mobile device carriers, governmental
units and other enterprises worldwide. We have assembled a portfolio of communications and portable infrastructure technologies, capabilities
and products that enable the upgrading of latent 3G networks to 4G and 4G-LTE networks and will facilitate the rapid roll out of the 5G
and 6G networks of the future. We focus on novel capabilities, including signal modulations, antennae, software, hardware and firmware
technologies that enable increasingly efficient data transmission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Our product solutions are complemented
by a broad array of services, including technical support, systems design and integration, and sophisticated research and development
programs. While we compete globally on the basis of our innovative technology, the breadth of our product offerings, our high-quality
cost-effective customer solutions, and the scale of our global customer base and distribution, our primary focus is on the North American
telecom infrastructure and service market. We believe we are in a unique position to rapidly increase our near-term domestic sales as
we are among the few U.S. based providers of telecommunications equipment and services.
NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
There have been no material changes in the Company’s
significant accounting policies as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the significant accounting
policies described in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements of the Company
were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
The results of operations and financial position for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2022 or any other
period. The amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the tables in the notes hereto, of the
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2022 and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, are
presented in United States dollars and are rounded in thousands with the exception of share and per share data. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and related disclosures
as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
on Form 10-K on August 16, 2022.
Effective January 21, 2021, the Company enacted
a 1-for-3 reverse stock split (the “Split”) of the Company’s common stock. These condensed consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes give effect to the reverse stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.
Effective February 10, 2023, the Company enacted
a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the “2023 Split”) of the Company’s common stock. These condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes give effect to the reverse stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.
Out-of-Period Adjustment (Error Correction)
See Note 12 –
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for
details related to an out-of-period adjustment (error correction).
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously
reported results of operations or loss per share.
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant estimates consist of the valuation of stock-based compensation; the valuation
of the assets and liabilities acquired; the valuation of the Company’s equity securities issued in transactions; the valuation of
inventory; the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of equity securities; the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and impairment
of long-lived assets and goodwill.

Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in
accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35,  Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets .
This accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds
its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset.
The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles – Goodwill and Other . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other
intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the
fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. As of June 30, 2022, the Company determined that it was more likely than
not that certain reporting unit’s fair value was below their reporting unit’s carrying amount due to a decline in the Company’s
market capitalization. Accordingly, it was necessary to perform interim impairment testing as of June 30, 2022. See Note 12 –
Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets . As of September 30, 2022, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that certain reporting
units’ fair value was below their reporting units’ carrying amount and, therefore, no interim impairment testing was required
as of September 30, 2022.
In determining whether a quantitative assessment
is required, the Company will evaluate relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after performing the qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would perform the quantitative
impairment test described in ASC 350. However, if, after applying the qualitative assessment, the entity concludes that it is not more
than likely that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company bases
these assumptions on its historical data and experience, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections,
and its expectations. The only reporting unit with a pre-impairment negative carrying value is Virtual NetCom, LLC.
The Company calculates the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit using the income approach. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of its
reporting units, which is determined using the income approach, and compares it to the carrying value. For the income approach, the Company
uses internally developed discounted cash flow models that include the following assumptions, among others: projections of revenues, expenses,
and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments to grow new units; and estimated
discount rates. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. There
are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date (exit price). ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement) as follows:
Level 1  – Observable inputs
that reflect quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on
an ongoing basis.
Level 2  – Quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market corroborated inputs.
Level 3  – Unobservable inputs
for which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability being measured. These inputs may be used with standard pricing
models or other valuation or internally-developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
The Company utilizes fair value measurements primarily
in conjunction with the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In addition, certain nonfinancial
assets and liabilities are to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. In general, nonfinancial
assets including goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment are measured at fair value when there is an indication of
impairment and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is recognized.
As allowed by applicable FASB guidance, the Company
has elected not to apply the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities to any of its currently eligible financial assets
or liabilities. The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable. The
Company has determined that the book value of its outstanding financial instruments as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 approximated
their fair value due to their short-term nature.

Discontinued Operations
On June 21, 2022, the Company completed the sale
of its Sovereign Plastics business unit to TheLandersCompanies LLC for total consideration of $ 2.0
million in a secured note with interest
of
5 % and a maturity date of
May 31, 2025 . The assets and liabilities of Sovereign Plastics are reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets as “Assets of discontinued operations” and “Liabilities of discontinued operations”,
respectively. The results of operations of Sovereign Plastics are included in “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
tax provision” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For comparative purposes,
all prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the classifications on a consistent basis. See Note 3 –
Discontinued
Operations
for additional information.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Accounting
for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments
by eliminating certain accounting models when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic
815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in-capital. Under this ASU, certain
debt instruments with embedded conversion features will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally,
this ASU eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. The new guidance is
effective for smaller reporting companies during annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022 which eliminates the need on
a go forward basis to assess whether a beneficial conversion feature needs to be recognized upon either (a) the issuance of new convertible
securities; or (b) the resolution of any prior period contingent beneficial conversion features.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718),
and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications
or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This new standard provides clarification and reduces diversity in
an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants)
that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Companies should apply the new standard prospectively to modifications or exchanges
occurring after the effective date of the new standard. This standard was adopted on January 1, 2022 and did not have a material impact
on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies the
guidance when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security
and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value
in accordance with Topic 820. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is evaluating ASU 2022-03 and the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including
accounting policies, processes, and systems.
NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

NOTE 4 GOING CONCERN
U.S. GAAP requires management to assess a company’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance and to provide related note disclosures in
certain circumstances.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the nine months ended September
30, 2022, the Company used cash flows in operating activities of $ 10.7
million, and at September 30, 2022 had cash of $ 0.6
million, had
an accumulated deficit of $ 257.4
million, and had a working capital deficit of $ 10.5
million.
The Company’s fiscal operating results,
accumulated deficit and working capital, among other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. Based on current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein (see Note 21 –
Subsequent Events –
Business Developments and Debt and Equity Developments ),
the Company presently only has enough cash on hand to operate
on a month-to-month basis, without raising additional capital or selling assets. Because of the Company’s limited cash availability,
its operations have been scaled back to the extent possible (see Note 21 –
Subsequent Events –
Business Developments ).
Management continues to explore opportunities with third parties and related parties to provide additional capital and/or sell assets;
however, it has not entered into any agreement to provide the necessary additional capital, except as disclosed herein. In the near term,
there may be limited opportunities to raise capital of significance due to the Company’s Nasdaq compliance issues, as discussed
in Note 21 –
Subsequent Events –
Nasdaq Compliance Developments .
The Company will continue to pursue the actions
outlined above, as well as work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet its future liquidity requirements. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake. If the Company is
not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which
would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately, it could be forced
to discontinue operations, liquidate assets and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

6 EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
The
Company accounts for earnings or loss per share pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260, Earnings Per Share,
which requires disclosure on the financial statements of “basic” and “diluted” earnings (loss) per share. Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to stock options, restricted stock awards
and warrants for each period.
There
were no adjustments to net loss, the numerator, or the denominator for purposes of computing basic earnings per share.
Potential
common shares issuable to employees, non-employees and directors upon exercise or conversion of shares are excluded from the computation
of diluted earnings per common share when the effect would be anti-dilutive. All potential common shares are anti-dilutive in periods
of net loss attributable to common shareholders. Stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive when the exercise price of these instruments
is greater than the average market price of the Company’s common stock for the period (out-of-the-money), regardless of whether
the Company is in a period of net loss attributable to common shareholders.
The
following weighted-average potential common shares were excluded from the diluted loss per common share as their effect was anti-dilutive

On June 23, 2022, the Company executed an agreement
to return fifteen patents and five pending or provisional patents to the former owners of Innovation Digital, LLC (“Innovation Digital”)
which resulted in the derecognition of goodwill and intangible assets shown in the tables above. See Note 20 –
Other Business
Developments
for additional information.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company determined that
it was more likely than not that certain reporting unit’s fair value was below their reporting unit’s carrying amount due
to a decline in the Company’s market capitalization. Accordingly, it was necessary to perform interim impairment testing as of June
30, 2022.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company, utilizing a 10% revenue growth rate and a weighted-average
cost of capital range of 13-25%, recorded an impairment charge for goodwill in the amount of $7.2 million and an impairment charge for
other definite-lived intangible assets of $7.5 million.
The Company calculates the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and the definite-lived
intangible assets using the income approach and compares it to the carrying value. For the income approach, the Company uses internally
developed discounted cash flow models that include the following assumptions, among others: projections of revenues, expenses, and related
cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments to grow new units; and estimated discount
rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill
impairment.
During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, the Company recorded amortization expense of intangible assets of $ 0.2
million and $ 0.9
million, respectively. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded amortization expense of intangible assets of $ 3.2
million and $ 6.5
million,
respectively. The Company’s amortization is based on no residual value using the straight-line amortization method as it best represents
the benefit of the intangible assets.

amortization period, in total and by major intangible asset class:

As part of the Company’s restructuring,
commencing January 1, 2023, the Company is integrating its previously separate reporting units, including employing a single integrated
sales function, and the Chief Executive Officer intends to manage the Company and make decisions based on the Company’s consolidated
operating results.
Out-of-Period Adjustment (Error Correction)
During the review of the Company’s condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022, the Company identified a $ 1,090,000
overstatement
of intangible asset impairment expense and a $ 406,000
understatement of intangible asset amortization expense (included in depreciation
and amortization) during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, which resulted in a $ 684,000
understatement of intangible assets,
net as of June 30, 2022. Based on management’s evaluation of the SEC Staff’s Accounting Bulletins Nos. 99 (“SAB 99”)
and 108 (“SAB 108”) and interpretations therewith, the Company concluded that the aforementioned error was not material to
the Company’s previously filed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. This is further
supported by the fact that the impacted income statement accounts are of a non-cash nature, do not impact Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before
income tax, depreciation and amortization, impairment expense and stock-based compensation), and would not likely have materially impacted
a reasonable investor’s opinion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Because the correction of these errors was not
deemed to be material to the results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, to correct these errors, the Company recorded the
corrections as out-of-period adjustments in the three-month period ended September 30, 2022. See the table below for details of the correction:

NOTE 13 LEASES
Operating Leases
The Company has operating leases for office, manufacturing
and warehouse space, along with office equipment. The carrying values of operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating
lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:

December 31,

2022
2021
Operating lease ROU assets
$ 1,183
$ 3,000
Operating lease liability
$ 11,573
$ 3,126
On February 1, 2022, the Company entered into
a lease agreement with the new owners of the Tucson Building (see Note 11 –
Property and Equipment, Net) , for a term of
10
years with no option to renew. Monthly rent increases annually from $ 98,300
per month in year one to $ 128,200
a month in the final year
of the lease. The Company posted a $ 1.0
million security deposit in connection with the commencement of the lease, which is classified
within other assets – long term on the balance sheet. The Company determined that the transactions represented a sale and leaseback
and, accordingly, established a new operating lease ROU asset and operating lease liability of $ 10.1
million. The lease did not include
an implicit rate of return; therefore, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on other leases with similar terms.

Lind Debt
For Notes A and B (the “Original Lind Debt”),
on or about April 15, 2022, as a result of the Company not filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021
on a timely basis, the Original Lind Debt entered into default, which resulted in a
5 % or $ 0.4
million increase in the principal value,
pursuant to the terms of the Original Lind Debt. The default also enabled the note holders, upon notice to the Company, to periodically
convert a portion of the associated principal and accrued interest into common stock at a
20 % discount to the three lowest daily volume-weighted-average-prices
during the prior twenty trading days (“Note Holder Conversions”).
For the Original Lind Debt, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2022,
the principal amount was reduced by an aggregate of $5.5 million, which was comprised of (a) a reduction of
an aggregate of $1.9 million (plus interest) due to pre-default scheduled cash payments; (b) a reduction of an aggregate of $1.9 million
(plus interest) due to pre-default scheduled equity payments (at the Company’s discretion, in lieu of cash) comprising 35,300 shares
of common stock; (c) an increase of an aggregate of $0.4 million (as discussed above) due to the debt’s contractual default provisions;
and (d) a reduction of an aggregate of $2.1 million of principal due to Note Holder Conversions into an aggregate of 211,227 shares of
the Company’s common stock.
See Note 21 –
Subsequent Events
–
Debt and Equity Developments
for information related to subsequent Note Holder Conversions. The subsequent Note Holder Conversions
enabled $ 5.6
million of the September 30, 2022 outstanding principal of the Original Lind Debt (and the related debt discounts) to be
reclassified from current to long term.
For Note C, on July 29, 2022, the Company sold
a promissory note in the principal amount of $ 26,250
to the Company’s senior secured lenders. This note bears interest at
15 % per
annum and is due July 29, 2023.

notes. While the note holders have the right to accelerate the maturity of the principal, the notice simply indicated that the holders
were reserving their rights. As of September 30, 2022, an aggregate of $ 1.3
million of principal is classified as long-term debt pursuant

NOTE 17 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, the Company may become involved
in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Management does not believe that after the final
disposition any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.
On January 27, 2022, a former employee filed suit
against the Company in the Tulsa County Oklahoma District Court, Case No. CJ-2022-00221. The plaintiff has alleged that she was entitled
to six months of severance pay after her employment contract was not renewed, and that her option agreements did not expire thirty days
after cessation of her employment, and claims she is owed approximately $75,000 in severance and $250,000 in damages for her options.
The Company filed an Answer on or about March 18, 2022. No due dates have been set. The Company disputes the plaintiff’s allegations,
has not accrued for any contingent losses, and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.
On June 16, 2022, the Company received notice
from certain former shareholders of SAGUNA claiming breaches of the SAGUNA stock purchase agreement and claiming that all of the former
shareholders of SAGUNA have suffered damages totaling approximately $ 13.9
million, which they calculated as the value related to the consideration
issued to those former shareholder for the acquisition of SAGUNA. The Company denies those claims and has not accrued for any contingent
loss. However, the Company may face legal claims or proceedings regarding those claims.
By notice dated July 14, 2022, the Company received
notice from a distributor that has a distribution agreement with InduraPower claiming that InduraPower, and the Company as guarantor,
has breached the distribution agreement, and are claiming approximately $ 2.0
million in damages, which includes a claim for $ 0.5
million
of foregone profit, which is not accrued because the Company denies that claim. The Company had received $ 1.5
million in cash as a deposit
against future product deliveries, of which $ 0.2
million has been recognized as revenue (resulting from product deliveries) through September
30, 2022 and the other $ 1.3
million is included in contract liabilities – current in the September 30, 2022 balance sheet.

NOTE 18 CONCENTRATIONS
Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers and generally does not require collateral related to its trade accounts receivable. At September 30, 2022, accounts receivable
from three customers comprised an aggregate of approximately
64 % of the Company’s total trade accounts receivable, and none of these
balances were characterized as uncollectible.
In addition, for the three months ended September
30, 2022, revenue from two customers individually exceeded
10 % of revenue and, in total, comprised approximately
75 % of the Company’s
total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, revenue from one customer individually exceeded
10 % of revenue and, in total,
comprised approximately
28 % of the Company’s total revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, there were no
customers that individually exceeded
10 % of the Company’s total revenue. At September 30, 2022, accounts payable from one vendor
accounted for
19 % of the Company’s total expenses.

million of Original Lind
Debt principal and $ 0.1
million of related interest into an aggregate of
1,310,911
shares of the Company’s common stock. As

On
October 17, 2022, the Company sold a promissory note in the principal amount of $ 367,500
to the Company’s senior secured lenders.
This note bears interest at
6 % per annum, is due October 17, 2023, and is secured by the August 25, 2021 Amended and Restated Security
Agreement between the Company and its senior secured lenders.
On
November 8, 2022, the Company sold a promissory note in the principal amount of $ 262,500
to the Company’s senior secured lenders
for proceeds of $ 250,000 . That note bears interest at
6 % per annum, is due November 8, 2023, and also is secured by the August 25, 2021
Amended and Restated Security Agreement between the Company and its senior secured lenders.
On
or about December 8, 2022, the Company canceled
667
shares of outstanding common stock due to the non-vesting of certain restricted stock

due to certain holders of outstanding convertible debentures dated January 29, 2021 (Note K – see Note 14 –
Debt ).
Both notes become immediately due and payable if the Company raises at least $2.5 million in an equity or debt offering. Both notes pay
8% interest per annum, which increases to 15% per annum if the notes aren’t repaid by the maturity date. The issuance of the second
note made the principal and accrued interest of both notes convertible if they aren’t repaid by the maturity date and the conversion
price will equal 81% of the closing market price of the common stock on the day that the holder elects to convert the note(s), subject
to a floor price of $5.00 per share.

Nasdaq
Compliance Developments
As
previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K filed on August 16, 2022, and in subsequent Form 8-K filings, the Company is not
in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), the $ 1.00
minimum closing bid price requirement (“minimum bid price”)
due to the price of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, because the Company was late with filing its Quarterly Reports on
Form10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 (collectively the “Delinquent Reports”),
the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic
financial reports (“filing requirements”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
On
November 17, 2022, a hearing was held before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) regarding the Company’s request
for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market of the Company’s common stock and additional time to regain compliance with
Nasdaq Listing Rules. On November 29, 2022, the Panel issued its determination, granting the Company’s request for the continued
listing of the Company’s common stock, subject to evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement by February
2, 2023, and evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s filing requirement by getting the Company’s remaining Delinquent Reports
filed with the SEC by February 24, 2023, and certain other conditions. Upon the filing on or before February 24, 2023, of this Quarterly
Report on Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company will be compliant with the filing requirements. The Nasdaq Panel
granted the Company’s request for an extension to obtain stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal on February 8,
2023, and to demonstrate compliance with minimum bid price requirement by February 24, 2023.
The
Company is working to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by February 24, 2023 for continued listing on Nasdaq.
The Company put forth a reverse split proposal to our stockholders, which was approved at the Company’s Annual Stockholders meeting
on February 8, 2023. On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company set the reverse stock split ratio at one-for-one hundred,
and approved and adopted a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which became effective at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023, to effect the reverse stock split. The Company’s common stock commenced trading on the post-split
basis on February 10, 2023, on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same symbol “COMS” with a new CUSIP number, 205650401.
There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to gain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

Statements
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” contains “forward-looking statements” that represent our beliefs, projections
and predictions about future events. From time to time in the future, we may make additional forward-looking statements in presentations,
at conferences, in press releases, in other reports and filings and otherwise. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than
statements of historical fact, including statements that refer to plans, intentions, objectives, goals, targets, strategies, hopes, beliefs,
projections, prospects, expectations or other characterizations of future events or performance, and assumptions underlying the foregoing.
The words “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “project,”

Forward-looking
statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether,
or the times by which, our performance or results may be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the
time those statements are made and management’s belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking

Overview
of Business; Operating Environment and Key Factors Impacting Our Operating Results
The
following MD&A is intended to help readers understand the results of our operations and financial condition and is provided as a
supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
(“Notes”) in Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Business
Overview
We
are a provider of solutions to network operators, mobile device carriers, governmental units and other enterprises worldwide. We have
assembled a portfolio of communications and portable infrastructure technologies, capabilities and products that enable the upgrading
of latent 3G networks to 4G and 4G-LTE networks and will facilitate the rapid roll out of the 5G and 6G networks of the future. We focus
on novel capabilities, including signal modulations, antennae, software, hardware and firmware technologies that enable increasingly
efficient data transmission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Our product solutions are complemented by a broad array of services,
including technical support, systems design and integration, and sophisticated research and development programs. While we compete globally
on the basis of our innovative technology, the breadth of our product offerings, our high-quality cost-effective customer solutions,
and the scale of our global customer base and distribution, our primary focus is on the North American telecom infrastructure and service
market. We believe we are in a unique position to rapidly increase our near-term domestic sales as we are among the few U.S. based providers
of telecommunications equipment and services.
We
provide the following categories of product offerings and solutions to our customers:
● Telecom
and Network Products and Solutions .  We design, develop, market and sell products for telecom network operators, mobile
device carriers and other enterprises, including the following:
● Wireless
Transport Solutions .   We offer a line of high-capacity packet microwave solutions that drive next-generation intellectual
property (“IP”) networks. Our carrier-grade point-to-point packet microwave systems transmit broadband voice, video and data.
Our solutions enable service providers, government agencies, enterprises and other organizations to meet their increasing bandwidth requirements
rapidly and affordably. The principal application of our product portfolio is wireless network transport, including a range of products
ideally suited to support the emergence of underlying small cell networks. Additional solutions include leased-line replacement, last
mile fiber extension and enterprise networks.
● In-Band
Full-Duplex Technologies .  We have developed proprietary wireless transmission technologies that alleviate the performance
limitations of the principal transmission technologies used by most networks today. Time Division Duplex (“TDD”) transmission
technology used by many communications systems utilizes a single channel for transmission of data alternating between downlink or uplink,
which limits capacity/throughput. Frequency Division Duplex (“FDD”) technologies in the marketplace today use two independent
channels for downlink and uplink but require twice the spectrum. Neither TDD nor FDD can simultaneously transmit and receive on a single
channel — a limitation that network advancements and 5G will require for optimal performance.
26
● Edge
Compute Capable Small Cell 4G LTE and 5G Access Radios.   We offer both 4G/LTE and 5G New Radio (“NR”)
based small cell radios that are designed to connect to other access radios or to connect directly to mobile devices such as mobile phones
and other Internet-of-things devices. Recently, we developed we believe the world’s first fully-virtualized 5G core network on
a microcomputer the size of a credit card, enabling, for the first time, the ability to have the 5G network collocated on the network
edge with the small cell communicating with the devices themselves. The small cells support edge-based application hosting and enable
third-party service integration.
● Tethered
Drones and Aerostats.  We design, manufacture, sell and provide logistical services for specialized tethered aerial monitoring
and communications platforms serving national defense and security customers for use in applications such as intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (“ISR”) and tactical communications. We focus primarily on a suite of tethered aerostats known as the
Winch Aerostat Small Platform, which are principally designed for military and security applications and provide secure and reliable
aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high-strength armored tether. Our recently-acquired
HoverMast line of quadrotor-tethered drones feature uninterruptible ground-based power, fiber optic communications for cyber immunity,
and the ability to operate in GPS-denied environments while delivering dramatically-improved situational awareness and communications
capabilities to users.
We
are also developing processes that we believe will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in silicon photonic (“SiP”)
devices for use in advanced data interconnects, communication networks and computing systems. We believe our novel approach will allow
us to overcome the limitations of current SiP optical modulators, dramatically increase computing bandwidth, and reduce drive power while
offering lower operating costs.
Our
engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale
application-specific integrated circuit design and verification, SiP design and integration, system software development, hardware design,
high-speed electronics design and network planning, installation, maintenance, and servicing. We believe this broad expertise in a wide
range of advanced technologies, methodologies, and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled
us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce future-generation communications and computing technologies.
In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network
equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.

Nasdaq
Compliance Developments
As
previously disclosed in our Form 10-K filed on August 16, 2022, and in subsequent Form 8-K filings, we are not in compliance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement (“minimum bid price”) due to the price of our common
stock. Additionally, because we were late with filing our Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30,
2022, and September 30, 2022 (collectively the “Delinquent Reports”), we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1),
which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports (“filing requirements”) with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
On
November 17, 2022, a hearing was held before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) regarding our request for continued
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market of our common stock and additional time to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. On November
29, 2022, the Panel issued its determination, granting our request for the continued listing of our common stock, subject to evidencing
compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement by February 2, 2023, and evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s filing
requirement by getting our remaining Delinquent Reports filed with the SEC by February 24, 2023, and certain other conditions. Upon the
filing on or before February 24, 2023, of this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company will
be compliant with the filing requirements. The Nasdaq Panel granted the Company’s request for an extension to obtain stockholder
approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal on February 8, 2023, and to demonstrate compliance with minimum bid price requirement by
February 24, 2023.
28
The
Company is working to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by February 24, 2023 for continued listing on Nasdaq.
The Company put forth a reverse split proposal to our stockholders, which was approved at the Company’s Annual Stockholders meeting
on February 8, 2023. On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company set the reverse stock split ratio at one-for-one hundred,
and approved and adopted a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which became effective at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023, to effect the reverse stock split. The Company’s common stock commenced trading on the post-split
basis on February 10, 2023, on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same symbol “COMS” with a new CUSIP number, 205650401.
There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to gain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
Significant
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenues
Our
revenues are generated primarily from the sale of our products, which consist primarily of telcom hardware, repairs, support and maintenance,
drones, tooling, consulting, warranties and others. At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in the contract
with customers and identify a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, we consider all products and
services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing
of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration
expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment,
provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, approximately 0% and 8%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from
sales outside of North America. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, approximately 14% and 28%, respectively,
of our revenues were derived from sales outside of North America. While our near-term focus is on the North American telecom and infrastructure
and service market, a key element of our growth strategy is to expand our worldwide customer base and our international operations, initially
through agreements with third-party resellers, distributors and other partners that can market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions.
We expect that over the short term our percentage of sales outside the United States may increase as we build up our domestic sales
and service teams. Notwithstanding such percentage increase, we expect the sales of tethered aerostats and drones will primarily be to
the domestic market customers, primarily to the U.S. government and its agencies, even if such systems are for integration into foreign
locations.
Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Our
cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of the costs of manufacturing products, procuring finished goods from our third-party manufacturers,
third-party logistics and warehousing provider costs, shipping and handling costs and warranty costs. We presently outsource the manufacturing
of our Fastback and DragonWave products to SMC for Fastback products and Benchmark for DragonWave products. Cost of goods sold also includes
costs associated with supply operations, including personnel-related costs, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, third-party
license costs and third-party costs related to the services we provide. Additionally, cost of goods sold does not include any depreciation
and amortization expenses as we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category within operating expenses.
Gross
profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including changes in our supply chain and evolving product mix.
The margin profile of our current products and future products will vary depending on operating performance, features, materials, manufacturer,
and supply chain. Gross margin will vary as a function of changes in pricing due to competitive pressure, our third-party manufacturing,
our production costs, costs of shipping and logistics, provision for excess and obsolete inventory and other factors. We expect our gross
margins will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors.
Operating
Expenses
We
classify our operating expense as research and development, sales, and marketing, and general and administrative. Personnel costs are
the primary component of each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries, sales
commissions, benefits, and bonuses. Additionally, we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category.
Research
and Development
In
addition to personnel-related costs, research and development expense consists of costs associated with the design, development, and
certification of our products. We generally recognize research and development expense as incurred. Development costs incurred prior
to establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development costs to continue to increase
as we develop new products and modify existing products to meet the changes within the telecom landscape.
Sales
and Marketing
In
addition to personnel costs for sales, marketing, service and product management personnel, sales and marketing expense consists of the
expenses associated with our training programs, trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, national
and local regulatory approvals of our products, travel, entertainment and recruiting. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue
to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales, marketing, service, and product management organization in support
of our investment in our growth opportunities, whether through the development and rollout of new or modified products or through acquisitions.
General
and Administrative
In
addition to personnel costs, general and administrative expense consists of professional fees, such as legal, audit, accounting, information
technology and consulting fees; share-based compensation; and facilities and other supporting overhead costs.
29
Depreciation
and Amortization
Depreciation
and amortization expense consists of depreciation related to fixed assets such as test equipment, research and development equipment,
computer hardware, production fixtures and leasehold improvements, as well as amortization related to definite-lived intangibles.
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense is comprised of interest expense associated with our secured notes payable, notes payable and senior convertible debentures.
The amortization of debt discounts is also recorded as part of interest expense.
Share-Based
Compensation
Share-based
compensation consists of expense related to the issuance of equity instruments, which can be in many forms, such as incentive or nonqualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, stock units and other forms of awards including performance-based
awards under our long-term incentive plans or outside of such plans. The expense related to any share-based compensation grant is allocated
to specific groupings in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in the same manner as the grantee’s normal compensation
expense and will vary depending upon the number of underlying shares of common stock, the fair value of the common stock on the date
of grant and the vesting period.

Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
Total
Revenues
For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
total revenues were $3.8 million compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase of $0.5 million,
or 15%, primarily consisted of increased sales of our aerostat products and accessories offset by decreases in our mobile network backhaul
products.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
total revenues were $7.9 million compared to $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase of $1.1 million,
or 16%, primarily consisted of increased sales of mobile network backhaul products, the sale of our aerostat products and accessories
and one-time sales of inventory.
Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
cost of goods sold was $1.8 million compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase of $0.5 million,
or 38%, primarily the sale of our aerostat products and accessories and payment to our contract manufacturer for the production of our
mobile network backhaul products and the materials, parts and labor associated with our other manufacturing activities.
For
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cost of goods sold were $6.2 million compared to $3.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021. The increase of $3.1 million, or 100%, primarily consisted of the one-time sale of inventory, the sale of our aerostat products
and accessories and the payment to our contract manufacturer, including increases in purchase price variances for the production of our
mobile network backhaul products and the materials, parts and labor associated with our other manufacturing activities.
Gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2022 was $1.8 million compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin
of $0.2 million, or 10%, was driven primarily by products that were lower margin during the current quarter as compared to the corresponding
period in fiscal year 2021 and increases in purchase price variances due to increased prices from manufacturing and logistical suppliers,
resulting from current macro supply chain constraints.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 was $1.5 million compared to $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin of
$2.1 million, or 58%, was driven primarily by the one-time sale of DragonWave inventory of approximately $1.8 million at a loss of $1.6
million due to the challenges related to the Company’s liquidity. In addition, it was impacted by products that were lower margin
during the nine months as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2021, and increases in purchase price variances due to increased
prices from manufacturing and logistical suppliers resulting from current macro supply chain constraints.
Research
and Development Expense
For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
research and development expense was $0.1 million compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease
of $2.0 million consisted primarily of contract labor and payroll related costs due to the suspension of research and development activity
as a result of liquidity challenges.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
research and development expense was $1.8 million compared to $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease
of $2.0 million consisted primarily of contract labor and payroll related costs due to the suspension of research and development activity
as a result of liquidity challenges.
While
costs have recently been reduced due to the Company’s liquidity challenges, management expects that these costs will increase modestly
as liquidity improves and the Company expands resources somewhat in order to focus on revenue enhancement.
Sales
and Marketing Expense
For
the three months ended September 30, 2022, sales and marketing expense was $0.0 million compared to $0.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2021. The decrease of $0.3 million primarily consisted of decreases in sales costs and cutbacks due to the Company’s
liquidity challenges.
For
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, sales and marketing expense was $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021. The decrease of $0.3 million primarily consisted of decreases in sales costs and cutbacks due to the Company’s
liquidity challenges.

For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
general and administrative expense was $2.7 million compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease
of $3.4 million primarily consisted of decreases in payroll and professional expenses attributable to cost reductions due to our liquidity
challenges.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
general and administrative expense was $13.8 million compared to $19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease
of $5.7 million primarily consisted of decreases in payroll and professional expenses attributable to cost reductions due to our liquidity
challenges.
While
costs have recently been reduced due to the Company’s liquidity challenges, management expects that these costs will increase modestly
as liquidity improves and the Company expands resources somewhat in order to focus on revenue enhancement.
Depreciation
and Amortization
For
the three months ended September 30, 2022, depreciation and amortization was $0.7 million compared to $3.6 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2021. The decrease of $2.9 million was primarily due to the sale of our Tucson Building (see below) and equipment,
partially offset by $0.4 million of additional amortization that was recorded in order to correct an understatement of intangible asset
amortization during the three months ended June 30, 2022.
For
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, depreciation and amortization was $1.7 million compared to $10.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. The decrease of $8.8 million was primarily due to the sale of our Tucson Building and equipment.
Impairment
For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
impairment was a credit of $1.1 million compared to $0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The credit of $1.1 million
was due to the correction of the second quarter 2022 overstatement of intangible asset impairment.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
impairment was $14.7 million compared to $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase of $14.4 million primarily
arose out arose out of:
● $7.5
million impairment of intangibles from re-calendarization of revenue into later periods; and
● $7.2
million impairment of goodwill from a decrease in the Company’s market capitalization.

For the three months ended September 30, 2022,
other expense was $1.3 million compared to other expense of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase of
$0.9 million primarily consisted of increases in the gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million, and foreign currency transaction
gain (loss) of $0.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $0.3 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
other expense was $4.1 million compared to other expense of $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease of
$2.2 million primarily consisted of a decrease in the gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million, partially offset by increases
in interest expense of $1.3 million.
Loss
from Continuing Operations
For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $2.0 million and $40.3 million, respectively, compared to a net loss from continuing
operations of $10.4 million and $37.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, related to the items described
above.
Loss
from Discontinued Operations
For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had net income from discontinued operations of $0.0 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021. The income in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a $1.1 million gain on the sale of Sovereign Plastics.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate
adequate amounts of cash to meet its cash requirements. As of September 30, 2022, we had $0.6 million in cash compared to $1.9 million
on December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.3 million resulting primarily from $10.7 million of cash used in operating activities and $7.6
million of debt repayments, partially offset by $15.1 million of cash proceeds from the sale of the Tucson Building on or about January
31, 2022. See Note 11 –
Property and Equipment, Net
in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more
information related to the sale of the Tucson Building.
As of September 30, 2022, we had a working capital
deficit of $10.5 million compared to working capital deficit of $3.6 million as of December 31, 2021.
As
of September 30, 2022, we had undiscounted obligations relating to the payment of indebtedness as follows:
● $14.2
million related to indebtedness that is due during the remainder of 2022;
● $0.1
million related to indebtedness that is due during 2023; and
● $3.9
million related to indebtedness that is due after 2026.
Subsequent
to September 30, 2022, the following developments should be noted:
● of
the $18.2 million of indebtedness that is outstanding, $7.0 million was converted into common stock; and
● additional
promissory notes with a face value of $7.0 million were issued.
Our
future capital requirements for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, and the costs
of our operations. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available. Any additional capital raised through
the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current stockholders’ ownership and could also result in a decrease
in the market price of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest
costs.
Going
Concern
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. For the nine months ended September
30, 2022, we used cash flows in operating activities of $10.7 million, and at September 30, 2022 we had an accumulated deficit of $257.4
million and we had working capital deficit of $10.5 million.
Our
fiscal operating results, accumulated deficit and working capital, among other factors, raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. Based on our current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein, we presently only have enough
cash on hand to operate on a month-to-month basis, without raising additional capital or selling assets. Because of our limited cash
availability, our operations have been scaled back to the extent possible. We continue to explore opportunities with third parties and
related parties to provide additional capital; however, we have not entered into any agreement to provide the necessary capital. In the
near term, there will be limited opportunities to raise capital of significance until our Nasdaq compliance issues are resolved, as discussed
in Nasdaq Compliance Developments herein.
33
We
will continue to pursue the actions outlined above, as well as work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet our future
liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that we may undertake.
If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately, we could be
forced to discontinue operations, liquidate assets and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $7.2 million. Financing activities primarily consisted
of repayment of debt of $7.6 million and preferred stock dividends paid of $0.2 million, which was partially offset by $0.6 million proceeds
of debt.
For
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $46.7 million. Financing activities primarily
consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock from the public offerings of $45.0 million and net proceeds of borrowings of
$14.2 million, which was offset by the repayment of debt of $6.4 million, offering costs of $5.3 million, and the repayment of related
party notes of $0.9 million.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
There
have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as set forth in the Company’s audited consolidated
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
34
However,
it should be noted that business developments commencing in the second quarter of 2022 (see Note 3 –
Discontinued Operations
and Note 20 –
Other Business Developments ) in the footnotes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein,
included discussions of selling or exiting of certain businesses and/or assets and of idling of employees. The Company recognized $11.6
million of impairment expense during the three months ended June 30, 2022. During the current quarter, the Company determined that it
was not more likely than not that any reporting unit’s fair value was below that reporting unit’s carrying amount. Accordingly,
it was not necessary to perform interim impairment testing as of September 30, 2022, but the Company may need to recognize additional
impairment expense in the near future.
Consequently,
for the purpose of emphasis, we are again disclosing below our accounting policy related to long-lived assets and goodwill.
Long-Lived
Assets and Goodwill
The
Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35,  Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment
or Disposal of Long-lived Assets . This accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
The
Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles – Goodwill and Other . Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if
events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.
As of June 30, 2022, due to a sustained decline
in the Company’s market capitalization, the Company recognized $11.6 million of impairment expense. As of September 30, 2022, because
there were no new significant Company developments, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform interim impairment testing
because it was not more likely than not that any intangible assets’ or reporting unit’s fair value was below its carrying
amount. As of December 31, 2022, the Company will perform its annual impairment testing and the Company may need to recognize additional
impairment expense at that time, if there are unfavorable events or changes in circumstances (e.g. deterioration in general economic conditions,
limitation on accessing capital, deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, etc.) which lead to quantitative impairment
testing and possibly a conclusion that the carrying value of certain intangibles or reporting units exceeds their fair value.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not
required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The
term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Principal Financial
and Accounting Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Principal Financial and Accounting Officer has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
As
previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, management has identified
the following material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures:
● While
improvements were made in the segregation of duties and controls over cash and accounts payable, we have not effectively segregated certain
accounting duties due to the now smaller size of our accounting staff;
● A
lack of timely reconciliations of the account balances affected by the improperly recorded or omitted transactions; and
● There
is a lack of documented and tested internal controls to meet the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Our
remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting is ongoing.
(b)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to
the internal control over financial reporting weaknesses described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
There
have been no material developments in any of the legal proceedings discussed in Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021, except as follows.
On
or about November 14, 2022, an intellectual property law firm filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of California, San Diego. The plaintiff alleges that they performed work for the Company and its subsidiaries and
are owed approximately $75,000.
On
or about November 15, 2022, the Company resolved the claims of former employees of SAGUNA who had, on or about July 17, 2022, filed an
insolvency request against SAGUNA in the Nazareth District Court, Israel, No. 27624-07-22. The approximately $200,000 of post-September
30, 2022 claims of the former employees were resolved and the action was dismissed on or about November 17, 2022.

On
January 9, 2023, a former employee of a subsidiary of InduraPower, filed suit against our Company in the Pima County Superior Court,
Arizona, Case No. C20230116. The plaintiff has alleged that he is owed for unpaid minimum wages and overtime wages, breach of employment
contract, retaliatory termination, and alleges an unspecified amount in damages. We dispute plaintiff’s allegations, and we intend
to vigorously defend the lawsuit.
Item
1A. Risk Factors
Readers
should carefully review the risk factors included under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our fiscal 2021 Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 16, 2022. However, due to recent activities of the Company, the following additional risk
factor has been identified:
The
Company May Be Delisted From Nasdaq
● Minimum
Bid Price . The Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement
(“minimum bid price”) due to the price of our common stock. The Company requested continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital
Market of its common stock and additional time to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. After a hearing before the
Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) the Panel granted the Company’s request for continued listing subject to evidencing
compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement by February 2, 2022. The Panel granted the Company’s request for an
extension to obtain stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal on February 8, 2023, and to demonstrate compliance with
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by February 24, 2023. In order to reach that goal, the Company put forth a reverse split proposal to its stockholders
that was approved at its Annual Stockholders meeting on February 8, 2023. Also on February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company
set the reverse stock split ratio at one-for-one hundred, and approved and adopted a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation which became effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023, to effect the reverse stock split. The
Company’s common stock commenced trading on the post-split basis on February 10, 2023, on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same symbol
“COMS” with a new CUSIP number, 205650401. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to gain compliance with
the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
As of the time of this filing, the prior day’s
closing bid price for our common stock was approximately $3.16 per share.
● Filing
Requirement . The Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file
all required periodic financial reports (“filing requirements”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The Company is delinquent with filing its Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2022. The Company requested
continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market of its common stock and additional time to regain compliance with the filing requirement.
After the hearing, the Panel granted the Company’s request for continued listing subject to evidencing compliance with Nasdaq’s
filing requirement by getting the delinquent Form 10-Qs filed, including the filing of the Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2022 by February 24, 2023, and certain other conditions. Upon the filing on or before February 24, 2023, of this Quarterly Report on
Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company should be compliant with the filing requirements. There can be no assurances,
however, that the Company will meet the deadlines for filing its delinquent Form 10-Q, or that the Company will be able to gain or maintain
compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
There
is no assurance that the Company will regain compliance during the grace periods or be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s
listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance during the grace period, Nasdaq will notify us that our common
stock, our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), and our warrants will
be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.
If
our securities were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an
adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common and preferred stock, greater difficulty in obtaining
financing, potential loss of confidence by employees, loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.
36
Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
There
have been no sales of unregistered securities within the within the reporting period that would be required to be disclosed pursuant
to Item 701 of Regulation S-K, with the exception of the following:
Between
July 22, 2022 and September 23, 2022, we issued to two accredited investors an aggregate of 165,358 shares of our common stock upon the
conversion of certain principal of outstanding senior secured convertible promissory notes at a weighted average conversion price of
$9.34 per share. Such shares were issued by us in reliance upon the exemption from registration available under Section 3(a)(9) of the
Securities Act.
Between
October 4, 2022 and December 9, 2022, we issued to two accredited investors an aggregate of 1,310,911 shares of our common stock upon
the conversion of certain principal and interest of outstanding senior secured convertible promissory notes at a weighted average conversion
price of $4.40 per share. Such shares were issued by us in reliance upon the exemption from registration available under Section 3(a)(9)
of the Securities Act.
Item
3. Default Upon Senior Securities
(a)
Defaults Upon Senior Securities
In
connection with our acquisition of Fastback on January 29, 2021, we issued to the sellers $11.2 million aggregate principal amount of
convertible promissory notes that mature on January 29, 2026. There is a provision in the convertible promissory notes that an event
of default could be declared if the Company fails to file its requisite its securities filings timely. The Company was delinquent with
its Form 10-Q filings. To date, while the convertible promissory note holders have reserved their rights, the convertible promissory
notes have not been declared in default, and the Company has a plan to regain compliance with such filings. Upon the filing of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company will be compliant with the filing requirement. No adverse actions
have been taken against the Company and we expect none insofar as filing compliance is regained. During January 2023, pursuant to a limited
time offer, certain Fastback convertible promissory note holders agreed to amend their notes and convert an aggregate of $1.3 million
principal of their notes and $0.3 million of accrued interest into 280,625 shares of the Company’s common stock.
On
May 27, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor, pursuant to which we sold to the investor a senior secured
convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of $11.0 million and warrants to purchase up to 18,200 shares of our common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for a purchase price of $10.0 million (representing an original issue discount of 10.0% on the note),
of which we received $5.0 million on May 28, 2021 and $5.0 million on June 2, 2021. On August 25, 2021, we entered into a first amendment
and limited waiver to the securities purchase agreement dated as of May 27, 2021 and amended and restated the convertible note.
The
amended note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of funding and matures on May 27, 2023. We were required to make
monthly interest and principal payments in 18 equal monthly installments of $611,000 each, commencing in November 2021. We had the right
to make interest and principal payments in the form of shares of common stock, which shares will be valued at 90% of the average of the
five lowest daily volume weighted average price per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date
of issuance of such shares of common stock. On or about April 15, 2022, this note went into default because the Company failed to timely
file its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the terms of that note, a mandatory default amount of five percent (5%) of the outstanding
principal amount was added to the principal amount. Additionally, the holder was able to demand, from time to time, repayment in the
form of shares of common stock, which shares will be valued at 80% of the average of the three lowest daily volume weighted average price
per share of the common stock during the twenty trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of a notice of conversion. As
of September 30, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.0 million was outstanding under this note. As of the date of
this filing, this note had a remaining combined principal and interest balance of approximately $50,000.
On
August 25, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor, pursuant to which we sold to the investor a senior
secured convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of $5.8 million and warrants to purchase up to 13,158 shares of
our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), for a purchase price of $5.0 million (representing an
original issue discount of 16.0% on the note), which $5.0 million was received on August 26, 2021.
The
note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of funding and matures on August 25, 2023. We were required to make monthly
interest and principal payments in 18 equal monthly installments of $322,000 each, commencing in November 2021. So long as shares of
our common stock are registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or may be sold without restriction on the number
of shares or manner of sale, we had the right to make interest and principal payments in the form of additional shares of common stock,
which shares would be valued at 90% of the average of the five lowest daily volume weighted average price per share of the common stock
during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of such shares of common stock. On or about April 15, 2022, this
note went into default because the Company failed to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the terms of that note,
a mandatory default amount of five percent (5%) of the outstanding principal amount was added to the principal amount. Additionally,
the holder was able to demand, from time to time, repayment in the form of shares of common stock, which shares will be valued at 80%
of the average of the three lowest daily volume weighted average price per share of the common stock during the twenty trading days immediately
preceding the date of issuance of a notice of conversion. As of September 30, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.8
million was outstanding under this note. As of the date of this filing, this note had a remaining combined principal and interest balance
of approximately $180,000.
37
In
November 2019, DragonWave entered into a secured loan agreement with an individual lender pursuant to which DragonWave received a $2.0
million loan that bears interest at the rate of 9% per annum and originally matured on November 26, 2021. Accrued interest is calculated
on a compound basis and is payable semi-annually in May and November of each year. Principal was due in full at maturity but can be prepaid
in full or in part without penalty. The loan is secured by all of the assets of DragonWave and is guaranteed by ComSovereign Corp. In
January 2021, a total of $1.0 million of principal of this note, plus all related accrued interest and charges, was extinguished in exchange
for shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In January 2022, a total of $500,000 was paid to the note
holder. As of the date of this filing, this note had a remaining principal balance of $500,000.
On
or about April 29, 2022, the Company sold an original issue discount note in the amount of $550,000 to an investor for the purchase price
of $500,000. This note was due approximately July 29, 2022 and bears a default interest rate of 12% after the maturity date. As of the
date of this filing, this note had a remaining principal balance of $550,000.
(b)
Material Arrearage in the Payment of Dividends.
On
October 29, 2021, the Company sold in a public offering 320,000 shares of the Company’s newly-designated 9.25% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), at a public offering
price of $25.00 per share, which is the initial liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock.
The
Series A Preferred Stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “COMSP”.
Dividends
at the rate of 9.25% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to an annual rate of $2.3125) on the Series
A Preferred Stock are payable monthly in arrears on or about the twentieth (20th) day of each month. Dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock are cumulative. The Company paid dividends commencing on or about November 20, 2021, and paid the monthly dividend through May
20, 2022.
On
or about May 25, 2022, the Company announced that it had suspended the payment on the Series A Preferred Stock to preserve cash. Since
June 20, 2022, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are accruing at the rate of approximately $61,664 per month. The total arrearage
on the date of filing for the accrued dividends is approximately $554,976.
