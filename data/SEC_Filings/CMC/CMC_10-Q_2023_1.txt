These notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the 2022 Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and six month periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Any reference in this Form 10-Q to the "corresponding period" or "comparable period" relates to the three or six month period ended February 28, 2022, as applicable. Any reference in this Form 10-Q to a year refers to the fiscal year ended August 31st of that year, unless otherwise noted. NOTE 2. CHANGES IN BUSINESS
Tensar Acquisition On April 25, 2022 (the "Tensar Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of TAC Acquisition Corp. ("Tensar"). The total cash purchase price, net of $ 19.6  million cash acquired, was approximately $ 550  million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and was funded through domestic cash on-hand. The acquired operations in North America are presented within the Company's North America reportable segment, and the remaining acquired operations are presented within the Company's Europe reportable segment. The table below presents the preliminary fair values and measurement period adjustments that were allocated to Tensar's assets and liabilities as of the Tensar Acquisition Date: (in thousands) Estimated Fair Value as Previously Reported (1) Cash and cash equivalents $ 19,551   Accounts receivable 37,741   Inventories 39,462   Prepaid and other current assets 12,528   Defined benefit pension plan 14,620   Property, plant and equipment 85,983   Intangible assets 260,500   Goodwill 186,805   Other noncurrent assets 19,660   Accounts payable ( 12,134 ) Accrued expenses and other payables ( 23,725 ) Current maturities of long-term debt ( 3,277 ) Deferred income taxes ( 45,055 ) Other noncurrent liabilities ( 16,347 ) Long-term debt ( 4,312 ) Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 572,000
__________________________________ (1) As previously reported in the 2022 Form 10-K. No measurement period adjustments occurred during the six months ended February 28, 2023. 9 Table of Contents Pro Forma Supplemental Information Supplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis is presented below as if the acquisition of Tensar occurred on September 1, 2020. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only, based on certain factually supported estimates and assumptions, which the Company believes to be reasonable, but not necessarily indicative of future results of operations or the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had been completed on September 1, 2020. These results were not used as part of management's analysis of the financial results and performance of the Company. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect anticipated synergies, but rather include the recurring income statement effects of fair value adjustments, such as depreciation and amortization. Further adjustments were made to remove the impact of Tensar's prior management fees, acquisition and integration expenses and interest on debt not assumed in the acquisition.
The resulting tax effects of the business combination are also reflected below.
(in thousands) Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Pro forma net sales $ 2,059,294   $ 4,102,962   Pro forma net earnings 383,256   623,633   The pro forma results presented above include, but are not limited to, adjustments to remove the impact of $ 3.2  million of acquisition and integration expenses from the six months ended February 28, 2022, with no such impact on the three months ended February 28, 2022. Results also reflect increased amortization expense from revalued intangible assets of $ 3.1  million and $ 6.2  million in the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively.
Advanced Steel Recovery Acquisition On September 15, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Advanced Steel Recovery, LLC ("ASR"), a supplier of recycled ferrous metals located in Southern California. ASR's primary operations include processing and brokering capabilities that source material for sale into both the domestic and export markets and are presented within the Company's North America reportable segment. The ASR acquisition is not material to the Company's financial position as of February 28, 2023 or results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, and therefore, pro forma operating results and other disclosures for the acquisition are not presented. Kodiak Acquisition On November 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a Galveston, Texas area metals recycling facility and related assets (collectively, "Kodiak") from Kodiak Resources, Inc. and Kodiak Properties, L.L.C. Kodiak's operating results are presented within the Company's North America reportable segment. The Kodiak acquisition is not material to the Company's financial position as of February 28, 2023 or results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, and therefore, pro forma operating results and other disclosures for the acquisition are not presented. Facility Disposition On September 29, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets associated with its Rancho Cucamonga melting operations and adjacent rebar fabrication facility ("the Rancho Cucamonga facilities"), which were part of the North America segment. On December 28, 2021, the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities was completed for gross proceeds of $ 313.0  million. A portion of the gross proceeds amounting to $ 39.0  million was set aside in a restricted cash account to facilitate the purchase of like-kind assets. In January 2022, the Company used $ 7.5  million of the restricted cash on a purchase of a like-kind asset. The remaining balance of $ 31.5  million was included in restricted cash as of February 28, 2022. 10 Table of Contents NOTE 3. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

Revenue related to raw materials, steel products and construction-related solutions in the North America and Europe segments and downstream products in the Europe segment is recognized at a point in time concurrent with the transfer of control, which usually occurs, depending on shipping terms, upon shipment or customer receipt. See Note 15, Operating Segments, for further information about disaggregated revenue by the Company's major product lines. Each downstream product contract sold by the North America segment represents a single performance obligation. Revenue from contracts where the Company provides fabricated product and installation services is recognized over time using an input measure; these contracts represented
7 % of net sales in the North America segment in both the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, and
8 % and
9 % of net sales in the North America segment in the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively. Revenue from contracts where the Company does not provide installation services is recognized over time using an output measure; these contracts represented
11 % and
12 % of net sales in the North America segment in the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, and
8 % and
9 % of net sales in the North America segment in the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively.
The following table provides information about assets and liabilities from contracts with customers: (in thousands) February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Contract assets (included in accounts receivable) $ 68,589   $ 73,037   Contract liabilities (included in accrued expenses and other payables) 30,230   27,567   The amount of revenue reclassified from August 31, 2022 contract liabilities during the six months ended February 28, 2023 was approximately $ 20.7
million. Remaining Performance Obligations As of February 28, 2023, revenue totaling $ 1.0
billion has been allocated to remaining performance obligations in the North America segment related to contracts where revenue is recognized using an input or output measure. Of this amount, the Company estimates that approximately
79 % of the remaining performance obligations will be recognized in the twelve months after February 28, 2023, and the remainder will be recognized during the subsequent twelve months. The duration of all other contracts in the North America and Europe segments are typically less than one year. NOTE 5. INVENTORIES, NET The majority of the Company's inventories are in the form of semi-finished and finished steel products. Under the Company’s vertically integrated business model, steel products are sold to external customers in various stages, from semi-finished billets through fabricated steel, leading these categories to be combined as finished goods.

million and a maturity date in October 2027, replacing the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a revolving credit facility of $ 400.0  million and a maturity date in March 2026. The maximum availability under the Revolver can be increased to $ 850.0
million with bank approval. The Credit Agreement also provides for a delayed draw senior secured term loan facility with a maximum principal amount of $ 200.0
million (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan is coterminous with the Revolver. As of February 28, 2023, the Company had
no
amounts drawn under the Term Loan. The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by its North America inventory. The Credit Agreement's capacity includes a $ 50.0
million sub-limit for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. The Company had
no
amounts drawn under the Revolver or the previous revolving credit facility at February 28, 2023 or August 31, 2022. The availability under the Revolver and the previous revolving credit facility, as applicable, was reduced by outstanding stand-by letters of credit of $ 0.9

NOTE 8. NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT TRANSACTIONS During 2016 and 2017, the Company entered into three New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) transactions with U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("USBCDC"). The NMTC transactions related to the construction and equipping of the micro mill in Durant, Oklahoma, as well as a rebar spooler and automated T-post shop located on the same site. As of August 31, 2022, $ 17.7  million of USBCDC’s contributions were classified as accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheet and $ 9.5  million of USBCDC’s contributions were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, in each case representing deferred revenue to the Company. During December 2022, the seven-year recapture period on the first NMTC transaction, the USBCDC Investment Fund 156, ended, and therefore, the corresponding $ 17.7  million USBCDC capital contribution was recognized in net sales during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023. See Note 10, New Markets Tax Credit Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K for discussion related to the Company's NMTC transactions. NOTE 9. DERIVATIVES
The Company's global operations and product lines expose it to risks from fluctuations in metal commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and natural gas, electricity and other energy prices. One objective of the Company's risk management program is to mitigate these risks using derivative instruments. The Company enters into (i) metal commodity futures and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of unanticipated changes in net earnings due to price volatility in these commodities, (ii) foreign currency forward contracts that match the expected settlements for purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) natural gas and electricity commodity derivatives to mitigate the risk related to price volatility of these commodities. 15 Table of Contents The Company considers the total notional value of its futures and forward contracts as the best measure of the volume of derivative transactions. At February 28, 2023, the notional values of the Company's foreign currency and commodity contract commitments were $ 371.5
million and $ 453.6
million, respectively. At August 31, 2022, the notional values of the Company's foreign currency and commodity contract commitments were $ 253.5
million and $ 205.1
million, respectively.

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE
The Company has established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Levels within the hierarchy are defined within Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. The following tables summarize information regarding the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis:     Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using (in thousands) February 28, 2023 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Investment deposit accounts

__________________________________ (1) Investment deposit accounts are short-term in nature, and the value is determined by principal plus interest. The investment portfolio mix can change each period based on the Company's assessment of investment options. (2) Derivative assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 are commodity futures contracts valued based on quoted market prices in the London Metal Exchange or New York Mercantile Exchange. Amounts in Level 2 are based on broker quotes in the over-the-counter market. Derivatives classified as Level 3 are described below. Further discussion regarding the Company's use of derivative instruments is included in Note 9, Derivatives. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had one Level 3 commodity derivative. The Company entered into its second and third Level 3 commodity derivatives in September 2022 and January 2023, respectively, with the same counterparty as the first Level 3 commodity derivative. Both the second and third Level 3 commodity derivatives will begin to settle in January 2025. The fair value estimates of the Level 3 commodity derivatives are based on internally developed discounted cash flow models primarily utilizing unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The Company forecasts future energy rates using a range of historical prices ("floating rate"). The floating rate is the only significant unobservable input used in the Company's discounted cash flow models. The following table summarizes the floating rate used to measure the fair value of the Level 3 commodity derivatives at February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022:
17 Table of Contents Floating rate (PLN) Low High Average February 28, 2023 575.51   1,298.53   793.65   August 31, 2022 460.11   1,298.53   717.22   Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Level 3 commodity derivatives recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

equivalent shares accounted for under the liability method. The Company expects
488,696
equivalent shares to vest. The following table summarizes total stock-based compensation expense, including fair value remeasurements, which was primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of earnings: Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Stock-based compensation expense $ 16,949   $ 16,251   $ 33,624   $ 25,870   NOTE 12. EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLANS In October 2022, the Company terminated its U.S. Pension Plan (as defined in Note 15, Employees' Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K). As part of the termination, the Company made a contribution of $ 4.1  million. Plan assets were liquidated to purchase annuity contracts with an insurance company for all participants.
The Company recognized a $ 4.2  million settlement charge as a result of the termination, including an immaterial non-cash charge for unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income as of the termination date. The $ 4.2  million settlement charge was recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings during the six months ended February 28, 2023. No benefit obligation or plan assets related to the U.S. Pension Plan remain. See Note 15, Employees' Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K for information on the Company's remaining defined benefit pension plan (the "U.K. Pension Plan," as defined in Note 15, Employees' Retirement
19 Table of Contents Plans, to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K), defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan and Benefit Restoration Plan ("BRP"). NOTE 13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Restricted stock is included in the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding but omitted from the basic EPS calculation until the shares vest. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive securities outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. The effect of dilutive securities includes the impact of outstanding stock-based incentive awards and shares purchased by employees through participation in the Company's employee stock purchase plan. The calculations of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:   Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 179,849   $ 383,314   $ 441,623   $ 616,203   Average basic shares outstanding 117,224,517   121,458,196   117,249,266   121,293,030   Effect of dilutive securities 1,498,742   1,394,214   1,735,832   1,454,951   Average diluted shares outstanding 118,723,259   122,852,410   118,985,098   122,747,981   Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.53   $ 3.16   $ 3.77   $ 5.08   Diluted $ 1.51   $ 3.12   $ 3.71   $ 5.02   Anti-dilutive shares not included above were immaterial for all periods presented. In October 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $ 350.0  million of shares of CMC common stock. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, the Company repurchased
330,000
and
1,605,452
shares of CMC common stock, respectively, at an average purchase price of $ 52.04
and $ 41.31
per share, respectively. The Company had remaining authorization to repurchase $ 121.8
million of shares of CMC common stock at February 28, 2023.
NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company becomes involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental matters. At February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the amounts accrued for cleanup and remediation costs at certain sites in response to statutes enforced by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA") were immaterial. Total accrued environmental liabilities, including CERCLA sites, were $ 5.6
million and $ 5.3
million at February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, of which $ 2.0
million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022. These amounts have not been discounted to their present values. Due to evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process and other factors, amounts accrued could vary significantly from amounts paid.

Any reference in this Form 10-Q to a year refers to the fiscal year ended August 31st of that year, unless otherwise noted. BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS Tensar Acquisition On April 25, 2022, we completed the acquisition of TAC Acquisition Corp. ("Tensar") for approximately $550 million, net of cash acquired. Through its patented foundation systems, Tensar produces ground stabilization and soil reinforcement solutions that complement our existing concrete reinforcement product lines and broaden our ability to address multiple early phases of commercial and infrastructure construction, including subgrade, foundation and structures. End customers for these products include commercial, industrial and residential site developers, mining and oil and gas companies, transportation authorities, coastal and waterway authorities and waste management companies. The acquired operations within North America are presented within our North America reportable segment and the remaining acquired operations are presented within our Europe reportable segment. See Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information about the Tensar acquisition. Advanced Steel Recovery Acquisition On September 15, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Advanced Steel Recovery, LLC ("ASR"), a supplier of recycled ferrous metals located in Southern California. ASR's primary operations include processing and brokering capabilities that source material for sale into both the domestic and export markets and are presented within our North America reportable segment. Kodiak Acquisition On November 14, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a Galveston, Texas area metals recycling facility and related assets (collectively, "Kodiak") from Kodiak Resources, Inc. and Kodiak Properties, L.L.C. Kodiak's operating results are presented within our North America reportable segment. Capital Expenditures In September 2021, we began the construction of a third micro mill. This micro mill will be the first in the world with the capability to produce merchant bar quality products through a continuous production process and will employ the latest technology in electric arc furnace ("EAF") power supply systems which will allow us to directly connect the EAF and the ladle furnace to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. The new facility, located in Mesa, Arizona, will replace the rebar capacity at our Rancho Cucamonga, California mill, which was sold during fiscal 2022, and will allow us to more efficiently meet West Coast demand for steel products. We expect this micro mill to be commissioned in spring of 2023. For further details on the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga, California mill, refer to Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q. In December 2022, we announced that our planned fourth micro mill will be located in Berkeley County, West Virginia. This new micro mill will be geographically situated to serve the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Mid-Western U.S. markets and will enhance our steel production capabilities by achieving synergies within the existing network of mills and downstream fabrication plants. We expect this micro mill to be commissioned in late calendar 2025. Senior Notes Activity In November 2022, we repurchased $115.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) through a cash tender offer. The remaining $ 214.1  million of outstanding principal on the 2023 Notes is due on
24 Table of Contents May 15, 2023 and was included in current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2023. Russian Invasion of Ukraine The Russian invasion of Ukraine did not have a direct material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three or six months ended February 28, 2023 or 2022. Our Europe segment has not had an interruption in energy supply and was able to identify alternate sources for a limited number of materials previously procured through Russia. However, we will continue to monitor disruptions in supply of energy and materials and the indirect effects on our operations of inflationary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, commodity pricing, potential cybersecurity risks and sanctions resulting from the invasion. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-Q, for further discussion related to the above business conditions and developments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as set forth in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our
2022
Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY
Business Overview Our vertically integrated steel-related operations manufacture, recycle and fabricate steel and metal products and provide related materials and services through a network of facilities that includes seven EAF mini mills, two EAF micro mills, one rerolling mill, steel fabrication and processing plants, construction-related product warehouses and metal recycling facilities in the United States and Poland. Through our Tensar operations, CMC is a leading global provider of innovative ground and soil stabilization solutions selling into more than 80 national markets through two major product lines: Tensar® geogrids and Geopier® foundation systems. Our operations are conducted through two reportable segments: North America and Europe. Key Performance Indicators When evaluating our results for the period, we compare net sales, in the aggregate and for both of our segments, in the current period to net sales in the corresponding period. In doing so, we focus on changes in average selling price per ton and tons shipped compared to the prior period for each of our vertically integrated product categories (raw materials, steel products and downstream products) as these are the two variables that typically have the greatest impact on our net sales. Raw materials include ferrous and nonferrous scrap, steel products include rebar, merchant and other steel products, such as billets and wire rod, and downstream products include fabricated rebar and steel fence posts.
Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to compare and evaluate the period-over-period underlying business operational performance of our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of the Company's earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment expense. Although there are many factors that can impact a segment’s adjusted EBITDA and, therefore, our overall earnings, changes in metal margins of our steel products and downstream products period-over-period is a consistent area of focus for our Company and industry. Metal margin is a metric used by management to monitor the results of our vertically integrated organization. For our steel products, metal margin is the difference between the average selling price per ton of rebar, merchant and other steel products and the cost of ferrous scrap per ton utilized by our steel mills to produce these products. An increase or decrease in input costs can impact profitability of these products when there is no corresponding change in selling prices. The metal margin for our downstream products is the difference between the average selling price per ton of fabricated rebar and steel fence post products and the scrap input costs to produce these products. The majority of our downstream products selling prices per ton are fixed at the beginning of a project and these projects last one to two years on average. Because the selling price generally remains fixed over the life of a project, changes in input costs over the life of the project can significantly impact profitability.
25 Table of Contents Financial Results Overview   Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, (in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 2,018,003  $ 2,008,888  $ 4,245,316  $ 3,990,689  Net earnings 179,849  383,314  441,623  616,203  Diluted earnings per share $ 1.51  $ 3.12  $ 3.71  $ 5.02  Net sales remained relatively flat for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period, and increased $254.6 million, or 6%, for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. Net sales in our North America segment increased in the six months ended February 28, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period, primarily due to a year-over-year increase in downstream products average selling prices, which more than offset a year-over-year decrease in raw materials average selling prices. Net sales in our Europe segment also increased during the six months ended February 28, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period, due to a greater volume of shipments of steel products, which mitigated a reduction in steel products average selling prices. The acquired Tensar operations also contributed to the period-over-period changes by providing $51.4 million and $113.0 million in net sales during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such activity in the corresponding periods. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, we achieved net earnings of $179.8 million and $441.6 million, respectively, compared to net earnings of $383.3 million and $616.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods. Included in net earnings during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 was a $273.3 million gain on the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities. See Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information on the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities. The remaining change in net earnings in the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods, was an increase driven by the expansion of steel products metal margin and downstream products margin over scrap per ton in our North America segment, partially offset by steel products metal margin compression in our Europe segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.4 million and $55.0 million during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods. Contributing to the period-over-period increases were $22.0 million and $43.9 million of selling, general and administrative expenses from Tensar operations' commercial and engineering support in the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such expenses in the corresponding periods. Additionally, the six months ended February 28, 2023 included a $4.2 million pension plan settlement charge, with no such settlement charge in the corresponding period. See Note 12, Employees' Retirement Plans, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information on the pension plan termination activity.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $2.1 million during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period, and remained flat during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. Contributing to the quarter-over-quarter decrease in interest expense during the three months ended February 28, 2023 was a $2.8 million increase in capitalized interest, compared to the corresponding period, resulting from the construction of the Company's third micro mill.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 were 23.6% and 23.1%, respectively, compared to 24.8% and 20.1%, respectively, in the corresponding periods. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared with the corresponding period, is due to multiple factors of which no single item was material. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with the corresponding period, is primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit on a tax restructuring transaction during the first quarter of 2022 that did not recur in 2023.
26 Table of Contents SEGMENT OPERATING DATA
The operational data by product category presented in the tables below reflects activity from sales of raw materials, steel products and downstream products, as applicable, which comprise the majority of sales in North America and Europe. The data is calculated using averages, and therefore, it is not meaningful to quantify the effect that any individual metric had on the segment's net sales or adjusted EBITDA. See Note 15, Operating Segments, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information on our reportable segments.
North America   Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, (in thousands, except per ton amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 1,640,933  $ 1,614,224  $ 3,457,832  $ 3,267,846  Adjusted EBITDA 299,311  535,463  677,267  803,987  External tons shipped Raw materials 321  329  637  663  Rebar 425  407  886  849  Merchant and other 236  245  479  502  Steel products 661  652  1,365  1,351  Downstream products 311  327  693  727  Average selling price (per ton) Raw materials $ 868  $ 1,103  $ 846  $ 1,068  Steel products 985  1,041  1,003  1,007  Downstream products 1,418  1,169  1,408  1,126  Cost of raw materials per ton $ 639  $ 834  $ 618  $ 800  Cost of ferrous scrap utilized per ton 346  436  335  432  Steel products metal margin per ton 639  605  668  575  Net sales in our North America segment remained relatively flat for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period, and increased $190.0 million, or 6%, for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. While average selling prices of downstream products increased 21% and 25%, respectively, during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods, raw materials average selling prices decreased 21% in both the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods. The period-over-period increases in average selling prices for downstream products, many of which are fixed at the beginning of the project, reflected the increased input costs from rising scrap and energy prices during late 2021 and 2022 when the contracts were entered into. The increased net sales resulting from shipments of these higher priced downstream products contracts were partially offset by the impact from the period-over-period reductions in raw materials average selling prices caused by the decrease in ferrous scrap prices during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods. Net sales were impacted to a lesser extent by volumes, which remained relatively flat across all product lines during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods. Although volumes during the second quarter of 2023 were negatively impacted by weather-related conditions, including significant precipitation in key markets, there was no impact on volumes from the planned maintenance that occurred during the second quarter of 2023, compared to the impact on volumes from the planned maintenance that occurred during the second quarter of 2022. The acquired Tensar operations also contributed $34.0 million and $76.1 million of net sales during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such activity in the corresponding periods. 27 Table of Contents During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $299.3 million and $677.3 million, respectively, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $535.5 million and $804.0 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods. Included in adjusted EBITDA during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 was a $273.3 million gain on the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities. See Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information about the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities. The growth in the remaining adjusted EBITDA during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods, resulted from increased steel products metal margin per ton and significant expansion in downstream products margin over scrap per ton. The growth in margins in our vertically integrated business model is a result of the consistent average selling prices for steel products and increases in average selling prices for downstream products discussed above, paired with the declining scrap price environment during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods. Additionally, the acquired Tensar operations provided adjusted EBITDA of $7.4 million and $15.5 million during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such activity in the corresponding periods.
Europe   Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, (in thousands, except per ton amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 355,633  $ 395,758  $ 762,146  $ 724,814  Adjusted EBITDA 12,949  81,149  77,454  160,981  External tons shipped Rebar 183  172  387  275  Merchant and other 253  278  522  540  Steel products 436  450  909  815  Average selling price (per ton) Steel products $ 756  $ 851  $ 775  $ 859  Cost of ferrous scrap utilized per ton $ 389  $ 444  $ 377  $ 439  Steel products metal margin per ton 367  407  398  420  Net sales in our Europe segment decreased $40.1 million, or 10%, during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period, and increased $37.3 million, or 5%, during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. Volumes remained strong during the three months ended February 28, 2023, though the $95 per ton decrease in steel products average selling price yielded a decrease in net sales during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. During the six months ended February 28, 2023, volumes rose 12%, exceeding the impact of an $84 per ton decrease in steel products average selling price, compared to the corresponding period. These decreases in steel products average selling prices were driven by a low pricing environment across Europe. Shipment levels were supported by our optimized cost structure, which positioned us to competitively price our steel products, coupled with our historical investment in operations, which provided the capacity to meet customer demand. Net sales from the acquired Tensar operations partially mitigated the impact from year-over-year decreases in steel products average selling prices by providing $17.4 million and $36.9 million in net sales during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such activity in the corresponding periods. Net sales for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $30.5 million and $110.1 million, respectively, due to the increase in the average value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Polish zloty, compared to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $35.2 million and $48.7 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 decreased $68.2 million, or 84%, and $83.5 million, or 52%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods. While the cost of ferrous scrap utilized decreased $55 per ton and $62 per ton during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods, the declines in steel products average selling prices described above outpaced falling scrap costs, resulting in decreases in steel products metal margin per ton of $40 and $22 during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods. In addition to the change in steel products metal margin per ton, increased costs of electricity and natural gas of $71 per ton and $57 per ton during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods, further contributed to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA. During the six months ended February 28, 2023, we received a $9.5 million energy credit, which helped mitigate higher energy costs by reducing cost of goods sold, but to a lesser extent than the $15.5 million energy credit received in the comparable period. Results also benefited from $1.5
28 Table of Contents million and $4.8 million of adjusted EBITDA provided by the acquired Tensar operations during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, with no such activity in the corresponding periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 included unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.0 million and $14.5 million, respectively, compared to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $7.3 million and $10.3 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods.
Corporate and Other Corporate and Other reported adjusted EBITDA losses of $15.6 million and $55.3 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to adjusted EBITDA losses of $52.5 million and $86.8 million in the corresponding periods, respectively. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, we recognized $17.7 million in other revenue from our New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) transactions, which was a primary driver of the decrease in adjusted EBITDA losses during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding periods. See Note 8, New Markets Tax Credit Transactions, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information. Also contributing to the decreases in adjusted EBITDA losses were $16.1 million in debt extinguishment costs incurred during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, compared to immaterial activity in the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, as well as $6.1 million and $12.5 million of additional gains on short-term investments and benefit restoration plan assets during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods. In contrast to these reductions to adjusted EBITDA loss, during the six months ended February 28, 2023 we recognized a $6.3 million increase in non-cash stock compensation expense, compared to the corresponding period, and a $4.2 million pension plan settlement charge, with no such settlement charge in the corresponding period. See Note 12, Employees' Retirement Plans, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information on the pension plan termination activity.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operating activities are our principal sources of liquidity and result primarily from sales of raw materials, steel products, downstream products and related materials and services, as described in Part I, Item 1, Business, of our 2022 Form 10-K and Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q .
We have a diverse and generally stable customer base, and regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable. We actively monitor our accounts receivable and, based on market conditions and customers' financial condition, record allowances when we believe accounts are uncollectible. We use credit insurance internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. We estimate that the amount of credit-insured receivables (and those covered by export letters of credit) was approximately 17% of total trade receivables at February 28, 2023.
We use futures or forward contracts to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and natural gas, electricity and other energy prices. See Note 9, Derivatives,
in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q,
for further information. The table below reflects our sources, facilities and availability of liquidity at February 28, 2023. See Note 7, Credit Arrangements, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for additional information.

__________________________________ (1) We believe we have access to additional financing and refinancing, if needed, although we can make no assurances as to the form or terms of such financing.
29 Table of Contents We continually review our capital resources to determine whether we can meet our short and long-term goals. We anticipate our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures, repay current maturities of long-term debt, including the $214.1 million outstanding principal amount of the 2023 Notes, pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase shares for at least the next twelve months. Additionally, we expect our long-term liquidity position will be sufficient to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. However, in the event of changes in business conditions or other developments, including a sustained market deterioration, unanticipated regulatory developments, significant acquisitions, competitive pressures, or to the extent our liquidity needs prove to be greater than expected or cash generated from operations is less than anticipated, we may need additional liquidity. To the extent we elect to finance our long-term liquidity needs, we believe that the potential financing capital available to us in the future will be sufficient.
We estimate that our 2023 capital spending will range from $550 million to $600 million. We regularly assess our capital spending based on current and expected results and the amount is subject to change.
Our credit arrangements require compliance with certain non-financial and financial covenants, including an interest coverage ratio and a debt to capitalization ratio. At February 28, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit arrangements.
As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash flows from operating activities were $558.9 million and $54.4 million for the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $410.9 million year-over-year net decrease in cash used by operating assets and liabilities was due in part to a decreased scrap price environment during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to increased scrap prices in the six months ended February 28, 2022, which reduced cash used by inventory purchases by $268.9 million year-over-year. Additionally, cash provided by accounts receivable increased by $182.2 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the decrease in accounts receivable as of February 28, 2023, compared to August 31, 2022, due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the three months ended February 28, 2023. These cash flows from operating assets and liabilities were offset by a year-over-year increase in cash used by in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables of $49.9 million. Additional activity offsetting the increase in cash flows from operating activities was $17.7 million of non-cash other revenue resulting from the settlement of our NMTC transactions during the six months ended February 28, 2023 and a $15.9 million reduction in loss on debt extinguishment during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. See Note 8, New Markets Tax Credit Transactions, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for further information on the Company's NMTC transactions. Investing Activities Net cash flows used by investing activities were $352.6 million for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to net cash flows from investing activities of $121.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The fluctuation in net cash flows used by investing activities was primarily driven by the proceeds from the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities during the six months ended February 28, 2022, compared to immaterial proceeds from the sale of assets in the six months ended February 28, 2023. Also contributing to the increase in cash flows used by investing activities were $97.7 million of additional capital expenditures in the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period, primarily from the construction of our third and fourth micro mills, and $65.2 million of acquisitions during the six months ended February 28, 2023, with no such acquisitions in the corresponding period. See Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information about the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga facilities and current period acquisitions. Financing Activities
Net cash flows used by financing activities were $283.7 million for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to net cash flows from financing activities of $324.4 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The $608.1 million increase in net cash flows used by financing activities was largely driven by net repayments of long-term debt of $160.3 million during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $427.2 million during the six months ended February 28, 2022. Additionally, there was a $49.3 million increase in treasury stock acquired under the share repurchase program during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the corresponding period. Offsetting these additional cash outflows was a decrease in net repayments of our Polish accounts receivable facilities of $21.6 million
30 Table of Contents during the six months ended February 28, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period. See Note 7, Credit Arrangements, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information regarding our credit arrangements and Note 13, Stockholders' Equity and Earnings per Share, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information on the share repurchase program. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations primarily consist of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for properties and equipment and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. See Note 7, Credit Arrangements, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information regarding scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. Our undiscounted purchase obligations due in the twelve months following February 28, 2023 were approximately $870 million and approximately $310 million due thereafter. Of the purchase obligations due in the twelve months following February 28, 2023, approximately 29% were for commodities, 19% were for consumable production inputs, such as alloys, 17% were for capital expenditures in connection with normal business operations and 17% were for the construction of our third and fourth micro mills. Of the purchase obligations due thereafter, 72% were for commodities and 18% were for the construction of our fourth micro mill.
Operating lease obligations in the twelve months following February 28, 2023 were approximately $39.8 million and $138.7 million due thereafter.
Additionally, leases that have not yet commenced, primarily for vehicles, with aggregate fixed payments over their terms, were approximately $14.1 million, with $10.5 million to commence in 2023 and $3.6 million to commence in 2024.
Other Commercial Commitments
We maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that governmental agencies, our insurance providers and suppliers requ est. At February 28, 2023, we had committed $21.4 million under these arrangements, of which $0.9 million reduced availability under the Revolver (as defined in Note 7, Credit Arrangements, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q). CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of conducting our business, we become involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental matters. We may incur settlements, fines, penalties or judgments because of some of these matters. Liabilities and costs associated with litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record liabilities for litigation-related losses when a loss is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period based on the current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at a particular balance sheet date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur. We do not believe that any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-Q contains or incorporates by reference a number of "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to general economic conditions, key macro-economic drivers that impact our business, the effects of ongoing trade actions, the effects of continued pressure on the liquidity of our customers, potential synergies and organic growth provided by acquisitions and strategic investments, demand for our products, shipment volumes, metal margins, the effect of COVID-19 and related governmental and economic responses thereto, the ability to operate our steel mills at full capacity, future availability and cost of supplies of raw materials and energy for our operations, share repurchases, legal proceedings, construction activity, international trade, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, capital expenditures, tax credits, our liquidity and our ability to satisfy future liquidity requirements, estimated contractual obligations, the expected capabilities and benefits of new facilities, the timeline for execution of our growth plan, and our expectations or beliefs concerning future events.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or circumstances or any other changes. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, among others, include the following: • changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products or construction activity generally, and the impact of such changes on the highly cyclical steel industry; • rapid and significant changes in the price of metals, potentially impairing our inventory values due to declines in commodity prices or reducing the profitability of our downstream contracts due to rising commodity pricing; • excess capacity in our industry, particularly in China, and product availability from competing steel mills and other steel suppliers including import quantities and pricing; • the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy, inflation, energy supplies and raw materials, which is uncertain, but may prove to negatively impact our business and operations; • increased attention to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters, including any targets or other ESG or environmental justice initiatives; • operating and startup risks, as well as market risks associated with the commissioning of new projects could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investments; • impacts from global public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on the economy, demand for our products, global supply chain and on our operations; • compliance with and changes in existing and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements and judicial decisions that govern our business, including increased environmental regulations associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions; • involvement in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments; • evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process and other factors that may impact amounts accrued for environmental liabilities; • potential limitations in our or our customers' abilities to access credit and non-compliance with their contractual obligations, including payment obligations; • activity in repurchasing shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program; • financial and non-financial covenants and restrictions on the operation of our business contained in agreements governing our debt; • our ability to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions and realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of acquisitions; • the effects that acquisitions may have on our financial leverage; • risks associated with acquisitions generally, such as the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, required approvals under applicable antitrust legislation and other regulatory and third party consents and approvals; • lower than expected future levels of revenues and higher than expected future costs; • failure or inability to implement growth strategies in a timely manner; • the impact of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges; • the impact of long-lived asset impairment charges; • currency fluctuations; • global factors, such as trade measures, military conflicts and political uncertainties, including changes to current trade regulations, such as Section 232 trade tariffs and quotas, tax legislation and other regulations which might adversely impact our business; • availability and pricing of electricity, electrodes and natural gas for mill operations; 32 Table of Contents • our ability to hire and retain key executives and other employees; • competition from other materials or from competitors that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources; • information technology interruptions and breaches in security; • our ability to make necessary capital expenditures; • availability and pricing of raw materials and other items over which we exert little influence, including scrap metal, energy and insurance; • unexpected equipment failures; • losses or limited potential gains due to hedging transactions; • litigation claims and settlements, court decisions, regulatory rulings and legal compliance risks; • risk of injury or death to employees, customers or other visitors to our operations; and • civil unrest, protests and riots. Refer to the "Risk Factors" disclosed in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for specific information regarding additional risks that would cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results, performance or our achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from historical results, any future results, or performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers of this Form 10-Q are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
During the six months ended February 28, 2023, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company's total gross foreign currency exchange contract commitments increased $118.0 million, or 47%, compared to August 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to forward contracts denominated in Polish zloty with a U.S. dollar functional currency, which increased $146.8 million, partially offset by forward contracts denominated in euros with a Polish zloty functional currency, which decreased $30.7 million compared to August 31, 2022. During the six months ended February 28, 2023, the Company's total commodity contract commitments increased $248.5 million, or 121%, compared to August 31, 2022, of which $240.5 million relates to the Company's electricity commodity commitments. There were no other material changes to the information set forth in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in our 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods, and includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, and they have concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended February 28, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 33 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
For information regarding our legal proceedings, refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q.
With respect to administrative or judicial proceedings arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, we have determined that we will disclose any such proceeding to which a governmental authority is a party if we reasonably believe such proceeding could result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of at least $1.0 million. We believe that this threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of environmental proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition. Applying this threshold, there were no environmental matters to disclose for this period. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2022 Form 10-K. Operating and startup risks, as well as market risks associated with the commissioning of our third and fourth micro mills could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investments.
We anticipate our third micro mill will be commissioned in spring of 2023, and our fourth micro mill is expected to be commissioned in late calendar 2025. Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar facilities, there are technological, operational, market and start-up risks associated with the construction and commissioning of our third and fourth micro mills. Construction of our micro mills is subject to changing market conditions, delays, inflation and cost overruns, work stoppages, labor shortages, weather interferences, supply chain delays, changes required by governmental authorities, delays or the inability to acquire required permits or licenses, any of which could have an adverse impact on our operational and financial results. Further, although we believe these facilities should each be capable of consistently producing high-quality products in sufficient quantities and at costs that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter cost overruns, system or process difficulties during or after startup or quality control restrictions with either or both facilities, our capital costs could increase materially, the expected benefits from the development of the applicable facilities could be diminished or lost, and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investments.
