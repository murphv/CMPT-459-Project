(in thousands, except share amounts and per share data)
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION
Photronics, Inc. (“Photronics”, “the Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is  one of the world’s leading manufacturers of photomasks,
which are high-precision photographic quartz or glass plates containing microscopic images of electronic circuits. Photomasks are a key element in the manufacture of ICs and FPDs and are used as masters to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor
wafers and FPD substrates during the fabrication of ICs, a variety of FPDs and, to a lesser extent, other types of electrical and optical components. We operate
eleven
manufacturing facilities, which are located in Taiwan ( 3 ),
Korea , China ( 2 ), the United States ( 3 ), and Europe ( 2 ).
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“the financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In
the opinion of management, adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The financial statements include the accounts of Photronics, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and
the majority-owned subsidiaries which it controls. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, where we discuss and provide additional information about our accounting policies and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported in them. Our estimates, including those on the impact of COVID-19, are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances at the time they are made. Subsequent
actual results may differ from such estimates. We review these estimates periodically and reflect any effects of revisions in the period in which they are determined.
Our
business is typically impacted during the first quarter of our
fiscal year by the North American, European, and Asian holiday periods, as some customers reduce their development and buying activities during this period. Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2023.
NOTE 2 – SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments consist of U.S. government securities and are classified as
available-for-sale. We classify available-for-sale securities on our consolidated balance sheet as follows:
-
Maturing within three months or less from the date of purchase
Cash and cash equivalents
-
Maturing, as of the date of purchase, more than three months, but
with remaining maturities of less than one year, from the balance sheet date
Short-term investments
-
Maturing one year or more from the balance sheet date
Long-term marketable investments
As of January 29, 2023, all of our available-for-sale securities had, at
their dates of purchase, remaining maturities of more than three months, but less than one year, and have been classified as Short-term investments.
10
Table of Contents
Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
or losses (net of tax) reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair values of our available-for-sale securities are Level 1 measurements, based on quoted prices from active markets for identical assets. In the event of a sale of an
available-for-sale debt investment, we would determine the cost of the investment sold at the specific individual security level, and would include any gain or loss in Interest income and other income, net, where we also report periodic interest
earned and the amortization (accretion) of discounts (premiums) related to these investments.
The table below provides information on our available-for-sale debt securities.

“us”, or “our”), and DNP, through its wholly owned subsidiary “DNP Asia Pacific PTE, Ltd.”, entered into a joint venture under which DNP obtained a
49.99 %
interest in our IC business in Xiamen, China. The joint venture, which we refer to as “PDMCX”, was established to develop and manufacture photomasks for semiconductors. We entered into this joint venture to enable us to compete more effectively for
the merchant photomask business in China, and to benefit from the additional resources and investment that DNP provides to enable us to offer advanced-process technology to our customers.
In 2020, in combination with local financing
obtained by PDMCX, Photronics and DNP fulfilled their investment obligations under the PDMCX operating agreement ( “ the Agreement”).
As discussed in
Note 6, liens were granted to the local financing entity on property, plant, and equipment with a January 29, 2023, and October 31, 2022, total carrying value of $ 74.0
million and $ 70.7
million, respectively, as collateral for the loans.
Under the Agreement, DNP is afforded, under certain circumstances, the right to put its interest in PDMCX to Photronics. These
circumstances include disputes regarding the strategic direction of PDMCX that may arise after the initial
two-year
term of the Agreement
and cannot be resolved between the two parties. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, DNP had not indicated its intention to exercise this right. In addition, both Photronics and DNP have the option to purchase, or put, their
interest from, or to, the other party, should their ownership interest fall below
twenty
percent for a period of more than
six
consecutive months. Under all such circumstances, the sales of ownership interests would be at the exiting party’s ownership percentage of the joint
venture’s net book value, with closing to take place within
three
business days of obtaining required approvals and clearance.
The following table presents net income we recorded from the operations of PDMCX during the reporting periods.

As required by the guidance in Topic 810 - “Consolidation” of the
Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”), we evaluated
our involvement in PDMCX for the purpose of determining whether we should consolidate its results in our financial
statements. The initial step of our evaluation was to determine whether PDMCX was a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Due to its lack of sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, we
determined that it was a VIE. Having made this determination, we then assessed whether we were the primary beneficiary of the VIE and concluded that we were the primary beneficiary during the current and prior year reporting periods; thus, as
required, the PDMCX financial results have been consolidated with Photronics. Our conclusion was based on the facts that we held a controlling financial interest in PDMCX (which resulted from our having the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impacted its economic performance) and had the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to PDMCX. Our conclusions that we had the power to direct the activities that most
significantly affected the economic performance of PDMCX during the current and prior year reporting periods were based on our right to appoint the majority of its board of directors, which has, among others, the powers to manage the business
(through its rights to appoint and evaluate PDMCX’s management), incur indebtedness, enter into agreements and commitments, and acquire and dispose of PDMCX’s assets. In addition, as a result of the
50.01 %
variable interest we held during the current and prior year periods, we had the
obligation to absorb losses, and the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to PDMCX.

Table of Contents
The following table presents the carrying amounts of PDMCX assets and liabilities included in our condensed consolidated balance
sheets. General creditors of PDMCX do not have recourse to the assets of Photronics (other than the net assets of PDMCX); therefore, our maximum exposure to loss from PDMCX is our interest in the carrying amount of the net assets of the joint
venture.

Xiamen Project Loans
In November 2018, PDMCX obtained approval to borrow
345.0
million
RMB from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. From November 2018 through July 2020, PDMCX entered into separate loan agreements
(the “Project Loans”) for the entire approved amount and, as of January 29, 2023,
26.4
million RMB ($ 3.9
million) remained
outstanding. The Project Loans were used to finance certain capital expenditures at the PDMCX facility and are collateralized by liens granted on the land use right, building, and certain equipment located at the facility. The interest rates on the
Project Loans are variable (based on the RMB Loan Prime Rate of the National Interbank Funding Center), and interest incurred on the loans was eligible for reimbursement through incentives provided by the Xiamen Torch Hi-Tech Industrial Development
Zone, which provide for such reimbursements up to a prescribed limit and duration. The Project Loans are subject to covenants and provisions, certain of which relate to the assets pledged as security for the loans, all of which we were in
compliance with as of January 29, 2023. In February 2023, PDMCX repaid the entire outstanding balance of
26.4
million RMB ($ 3.9
million).
Xiamen Working Capital Loans
In November 2018, PDMCX obtained approval for revolving, unsecured credit of the equivalent of $ 25.0
million, pursuant to which PDMCX may enter into separate loan agreements with varying terms to maturity. This facility is subject to annual reviews and extensions, with the most recent
extension set to expire in
November 2023 . In December 2022, we repaid our entire outstanding balance of
25.6
million RMB ($ 3.6
million). As of
January 29, 2023, PDMCX had
no
amount outstanding against the approval . The interest rates are variable, based on the RMB Loan Prime Rate of the National Interbank Funding Center. Interest incurred on the loans
related to the amount borrowed
was eligible for reimbursement through incentives provided by the Xiamen Torch Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, which provided for such reimbursements up to a prescribed limit and duration.
Finance Leases
In February 2021, we entered into a
five-year
$ 7.2
million finance lease
for a high-end inspection tool. Monthly payments on the lease, which commenced in February 2021, are $ 0.1
million per month. Upon the
payment of the fiftieth monthly payment and prior to payment of the fifty-first monthly payment, we may exercise an early buyout option to purchase the tool for $ 2.4
million. If we do not exercise the early buyout option, then at the end of the
five-year
lease term, the lease shall continue to renew on a month-to-month basis at the same rental terms; at our option, after the original term or any renewal periods, we may return the tool, elect to extend the lease, or purchase the tool at its fair
market value. Since we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the early buyout option, our lease liability reflects such exercise and we have classified the lease as a finance lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is
1.08 %.
14
Table of Contents
In December
2020, we entered into a
five-year
$ 35.5
million finance lease for a high-end lithography tool. Monthly payments on the lease, which commenced in January 2021, increased from $ 0.04
million during the first three months to $ 0.6
million for the following nine months, followed by forty-eight monthly payments of $ 0.5
million. As of the due date of the forty-eighth monthly payment, we may exercise an early buyout option to purchase the tool for $ 14.1
million. If we do not exercise the early buyout option, then at the end of the
five-year
lease term, at our option, we may return the tool, elect to extend the lease term for a period and a lease payment to be agreed with lessor at the time, or purchase
the tool for its then-fair market value, as determined by the lessor. Since we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the early buyout option, our lease liability reflects such exercise and we have classified the lease as a finance lease. The
interest rate implicit in the lease is
1.58 %. The lease agreement incorporates the covenants included in our Corporate Credit Agreement,
which are detailed below, and includes a cross-default provision for any agreement or instrument with an outstanding, committed balance greater than $ 5.0
million in which we are the indebted party.
Corporate Credit Agreement
In September 2018, we entered into a
five-year
amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which has a $ 50
million borrowing limit, with an expansion capacity to $ 100
million. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the United States and common stock we own in certain
subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement includes covenants around minimum interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio, and minimum unrestricted cash balance (all of which we were in compliance with at January 29, 2023), and limits the amount of cash
dividends, distributions, and redemptions we can pay on our common stock to an aggregate annual amount of $ 50
million. We had
no
outstanding borrowings against the Credit Agreement at January 29, 2023. The interest rate on the Credit Agreement ( 5.52 % at January 29, 2023) is based on our total leverage ratio at one-month LIBOR plus a spread, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
Hefei Equipment Loan
In October
2020, our Hefei, China, facility was approved to borrow
200
million RMB
from the China Construction Bank Corporation.
In July
2022, we repaid our entire outstanding balance of
120.7
million RMB ($ 18.0
million ).
This credit facility was subject to annual reviews and extension; the
most recent
extension
expired in August
2022
and we did not
apply for an extension. The loan proceeds were used to fund purchases of
two
lithography tools at the Hefei facility. The interest rate on the loan was variable and based on the RMB Loan Prime Rate of the National Interbank Funding Center. The borrowings were secured by the Hefei
facility, its related land use right, and certain manufacturing equipment. The Hefei Equipment Loan was subject to covenants and provisions, certain of which relate to the assets pledged as security for the loan, including covenants for the ratio
of total liabilities to total assets and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, all of which we were in compliance with at the time of repayment.
NOTE 7 - REVENUE
We recognize revenue when, or as, control of a good or service
transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring those goods or services. We account for an arrangement as a revenue contract when each party has approved and is
committed to perform under the contract, the rights of the contracting parties regarding the goods or services to be transferred and the payment terms are identifiable, the arrangement has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is
probable. Substantially all of our revenue comes from the sales of photomasks. We typically contract with our customers to sell sets of photomasks, which are comprised of multiple layers, the predominance of which we invoice as they ship to
customers. As the photomasks are manufactured to customer specifications, they have
no
alternative use to us and, as our contracts generally provide us with the right to
payment for work completed to date, we recognize revenue as we perform, or “over time”, on most of our contracts. We measure our performance to date using an input method, which is based on our estimated costs to complete the various
manufacturing phases of a photomask. At the end of a reporting period, there are a number of uncompleted revenue contracts on which we have performed; for any such contracts under which we are entitled to be compensated for our costs incurred
plus a reasonable profit, we recognize revenue and a corresponding contract asset for such performance. We account for shipping and handling activities that we perform after a customer obtains control of a good as being activities to fulfill our
promise to transfer the good to the customer, rather than as promised services, or performance obligations, under the contract. We report our revenue net of any sales or similar taxes we collect on behalf of government entities.
As stated above, photomasks are manufactured to customer specifications in accordance with their proprietary designs; thus, they
are individually unique. Due to their uniqueness and other factors, their transaction prices are individually established through negotiations with customers; consequently, our photomasks do not have standard or “list” prices. The transaction
prices of the vast majority of our revenue contracts include only fixed amounts of consideration. In certain instances, such as when we offer a customer an early payment discount, an estimate of variable consideration would be included in the
transaction price, but only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur when the uncertainty related to the variability was resolved.
15
Table of Contents
Contract Assets, Contract Liabilities, and Accounts Receivable
We recognize a contract asset when our performance under a contract precedes our receipt of consideration from a customer, or before payment is due, and our receipt of consideration is conditional upon factors other than the
passage of time. Contract assets reflect our transfer of control of photomasks that are in process or completed but not yet shipped to customers. A receivable is recognized when we have an unconditional right to payment for our performance, which
generally occurs when we ship the photomasks. Our contract assets primarily consist of a significant amount of our in-process production orders and fully manufactured photomasks which have not yet shipped, for which we have an enforceable right to
collect consideration (including a reasonable profit) in the event the in-process orders are cancelled by customers. On an individual contract basis, we net contract assets with contract liabilities (deferred revenue) for financial reporting
purposes. We did
no t identify impairment indicators for any outstanding contract assets during the
three -month periods ended
January 29, 2023,
or
January 30, 2022 .

We generally record our accounts receivable at their billed
amounts. All outstanding past due customer invoices are reviewed for collectability during, and at the end of, every reporting period. To the extent we believe a loss on the collection of a customer invoice is probable, we record the loss and
credit an allowance for credit losses. In the event that an amount is determined to be uncollectible, we charge the allowance for credit losses and derecognize the related receivable. We did not incur any credit losses on our accounts receivable
during the three-month periods ended January 29, 2023,
or
January 30, 2022.
Our invoice terms generally range from net- thirty
to
ninety days , depending on both the geographic market in which the transaction occurs and our payment agreements with specific
customers. In the event that our evaluation of a customer’s business prospects and financial condition indicate that the customer presents a collectability risk, we modify terms of sale, which may require payment in advance of performance. At the
time of adoption, we elected the practical expedient allowed under ASC Topic
606
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic
606 ”) that permits us not to adjust a contract’s promised amount of consideration to reflect a financing component when the period between when we transfer control of goods or services to customers and when we are
paid is
one
year or less.
In instances when we are paid in advance of our performance, we
record a contract liability and, as allowed under the practical expedient in Topic
606 , recognize interest expense only if the period between when we receive payment from the
customer and the date when we expect to be entitled to the payment is greater than
one
year. Historically, advance payments we have received from customers have generally not
preceded the completion of our performance obligations by more than
one
year.

Table of Contents
Contract Costs
We pay commissions to third-party sales agents for certain sales they procure on our behalf. However, the bases of the commissions
are the transaction prices of the sales, which are completed in less than one year; thus, no relationship is established with a customer that will result in future business. Therefore, we do not recognize any portion of these sales commissions as
costs of obtaining a contract, nor do we currently foresee other circumstances under which we would recognize contract obtainment costs as assets.
Remaining Performance Obligations
As we are typically required to fulfill customer orders within a short period of time, our backlog of orders has historically been
two
to
three weeks
for FPD photomasks and
one
to
two weeks
for IC
photomasks. However, the demand for some IC photomasks has expanded beyond the industry ’ s capacity to supply them within the traditional time period; thus the backlog, in some
cases, can expand to as long as
two
to
three months . As allowed under Topic 606, we have elected not to disclose our remaining performance obligations, which represent the costs associated with the completion of the manufacturing process of in-process photomasks related to
contracts that have an original duration of one year or less.
Product Warranties
Our photomasks are sold under warranties that generally range from
one
to
twenty-four months . We warrant that our photomasks conform to customer specifications and will typically repair, replace, or
issue a refund for any photomasks that fail to do so. The warranties do not represent separate performance obligations in our revenue contracts. Historically, customer claims under warranties have been immaterial.
NOTE 8 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
In March 2016, shareholders approved our current equity incentive
compensation plan (the “Plan”), under which incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock grants, stock-based awards, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units, performance stock, and other
stock or cash awards may be granted. Shares to be issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares, issued shares that have been reacquired by us (in the open market or in private transactions), or a combination thereof. The maximum
number of shares of common stock approved that may be issued under the Plan is  four
million shares. Awards may be granted to officers,
employees, directors, consultants, advisors, and independent contractors of Photronics or its subsidiaries. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the Plan), the vesting of awards may be accelerated. The Plan, aspects of which are more
fully described below, prohibits further awards from being issued under prior plans.
The table below presents information on our share-based compensation expenses for the three-month periods ended January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022.

Stock Options
Option awards generally vest in
one
to
four years
and have a
ten-year
contractual term. All incentive and non-qualified stock option grants must have an exercise price no less than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The grant-date fair values of options are based on closing prices
of our common stock on the dates of grant and are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock. We use historical option exercise behavior and employee
termination data to estimate expected term, which represents the period of time that options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate of return for the estimated term of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the date of grant.

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES
We calculate our provision for income taxes at the end of each interim reporting period on the basis of an estimated annual
effective tax rate adjusted for tax items that are discrete to each period.
The table below sets forth the primary reasons that our effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory tax rates in effect during the three-month periods ended January 29, 2023, and
January 30, 2022.

Uncertain Tax
Positions
Although the timing of reversal of uncertain tax positions may be
uncertain, as they can be dependent upon the settlement of tax audits, we believe that the amount of uncertain tax positions (including interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits) that may be resolved over the next twelve months is $ 0.4
million. Resolution of these uncertain tax positions may result from either or both the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements. We
are no longer subject to tax authority examinations in the U.S., major foreign, or state tax jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year  2017 .

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
As of January 29, 2023, we had commitments outstanding for capital expenditures of approximately $ 132.0
million,
primarily for purchases of high-end equipment.
In May 2022, we were informed of a customs audit in
one
of our China operations. We estimated a contingency ranging from $ 2.2
million to $ 3.7
million, which include unpaid additional customs duties and related interest and
penalties for the previous
three years
(the period under audit). In the three-month period ended May 1, 2022, we recorded a contingent
loss of $ 2.2
million, as we believed this was the most likely outcome. The $ 2.2
million amount was recorded with a charge to
Cost of goods sold
in the condensed consolidated statements of income and
Accrued liabilities
in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In November 2022, upon settlement of the audit, we reversed $ 1.0
million of the accrual.
We are subject to various other claims that
arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe that our potential liability under such claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 13 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The accounting framework for determining fair value includes a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information
used to measure fair value, which enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements. The fair value hierarchy consists of three tiers as follows: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical securities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The fair
values of our cash and certain cash equivalents (Level 1 measurements), accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain other current assets and current liabilities (Level 2 measurements) approximate their carrying values due to their short-term
maturities. The fair values of our Short-term investments are Level 1 measurements. (Please refer to “Investments” within Note 2 for additional fair value information on our Short-term investments.) The fair values of certain cash equivalents are
Level 2 measurements that are provided by independent third-party pricing services or other independent entities, which may use matrix pricing, valuation models, or other methods which utilize observable market data. The fair values of our
variable-rate debt instruments are Level 2 measurements and approximate their carrying values due to the variable nature of their underlying interest rates. Other than our Short-term investments, we did
no t have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring or a nonrecurring basis, at
January 29, 2023 , or October 31, 2022.

NOTE 15 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Accounting Standards
Updates to be Adopted
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance”, to
increase the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of the types of assistance an entity receives, an entity’s method of accounting for government assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial
statements. The guidance in this Update will be effective for Photronics in its fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, with early application of the amendments allowed. The amendments are to be applied prospectively to all transactions within the scope of
the amendments that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application or, retrospectively to those transactions. We are currently evaluating
the effect the adoption of this ASU may have on our disclosures.
In March
2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”, which provides optional expedients and exceptions to applying the guidance on contract
modifications, hedge accounting, and other transactions, to simplify the accounting for transitioning from LIBOR, and other interbank offered rates expected to be discontinued, to alternative reference rates. The guidance in this Update was
effective upon its issuance; if elected, it was to be applied prospectively from December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 “Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848” which extended the time that the optional expedients
and exceptions may be adopted to December 31, 2024.  We do not expect the impact of this ASU to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Item 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Management's discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes. Various sections of this MD&A contain forward-looking statements, all of which are presented based on current expectations, which may be adversely affected by uncertainties and risk factors (presented
throughout this filing and in the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022), that may cause actual results to materially differ from these expectations. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.
We sell substantially all of our photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers, and manufacturers of FPDs. Photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other
higher-performance electronic products such as photonics, microelectronic mechanical systems, and certain nanotechnology applications. Our selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor and display
designs and applications, particularly as they relate to the semiconductor industry's migration to more advanced product innovation, design methodologies, and fabrication processes. The demand for photomasks primarily depends on design
activity rather than sales volumes from products manufactured using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or display sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. However, the
reduced use of customized ICs, reductions in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or display designs could reduce
demand for photomasks ‒ even if the demand for semiconductors and displays increases. Advances in semiconductor, display, and photomask design and production methods that shift the burden of achieving device performance away from lithography
could also reduce the demand for photomasks. Historically, the microelectronics industry has been volatile, experiencing periodic downturns and slowdowns in design activity. These negative trends have been characterized by, among other
things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity, and accelerated erosion of selling prices, with a concomitant effect on revenue and profitability.
We are typically required to fulfill customer orders within a short period of time, sometimes within twenty-four hours. This results in a minimal level of backlog, typically two to three
weeks of backlog for FPD photomasks and one to two weeks for IC photomasks. However, the demand for some IC photomasks has expanded beyond the industry’s capacity to supply them within the traditional time period; thus, for some products, the
backlog can expand to as long as two to three months.
The global semiconductor and FPD industries are driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer-driven applications of high-performance devices, including, but not limited
to, mobile display devices, mobile communications, and computing solutions. While we cannot predict the timing of the industry's transition to volume production of next-generation technology nodes, or the timing of up and down-cycles with
precise accuracy, we believe that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future, beneficially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results as they occur. We believe our ability to remain
successful in these environments is dependent upon the achievement of our goals of being a service and technology leader and efficient solutions supplier, which we believe should enable us to continually reinvest in our global infrastructure.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
All of our facilities have continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, since shortly after it was first identified near the end of calendar year 2019, the pandemic has had an impact on our
business in a number of ways including customer shutdowns, which led to delays in new photomask design releases, and travel restrictions, which delayed tool installations and servicing. To date, we have not experienced significant raw
material shortages; however, supply-chain disruptions could potentially delay or prevent us from fulfilling customer orders.
At certain facilities, employees not required to be on-site to maintain production have worked remotely at various times
‒
either at our discretion or due to government
mandates. The implementation of these measures has not materially affected our operations.

Revenue
Our quarterly revenues can be affected by the seasonal purchasing practices of our customers. As a result, demand for our products is typically reduced during the
first quarter of our fiscal year by the North American, European, and Asian holiday periods, as some of our customers reduce their development and, consequently, their buying activities during those periods.

** This table disaggregates revenue by the location in which it was earned.
Revenue in Q1 FY23 was $211.1 million, representing an increase of 0.4% compared with Q4 FY22 and 11.2% from Q1 FY22.
IC photomask revenue increased 0.2% and 20.7% in Q1 FY23, compared with Q4 FY22 and Q1 FY22, respectively. These increases were driven by continued strong demand in Asia, resulting from robust design activity
for high-end products, and increased pricing and continued strong demand for mainstream products used for computer chips used in the production of consumer goods, products considered part of the “internet-of-things”, 5G wireless technology
applications, and cryptocurrency mining.
The increase from Q4 FY22 is due to increased high-end demand, particularly in Asia, more than offsetting limited softness in mainstream. Although somewhat softer, mainstream demand remains strong, due to the
proliferation of IC’s. This strong demand continues to strain the photomask industry’s mainstream tool capacity, thereby providing the conditions that support a favorable pricing environment. This has enabled us to maintain increased selling
prices, though expediting premiums that customers pay to accelerate deliveries have decreased. The increase from Q1 FY22, is driven by continued strong growth in Asia and the U.S. for high-end products, increased pricing and continued growth
for mainstream products.
26
Table of Contents
FPD revenue increased 0.8% and decreased 9.3% in Q1 FY23, compared with Q4 FY22 and Q1 FY22, respectively. The increase from Q4 FY22 is driven by increased high-end demand more than offsetting lower mainstream
demand. High-end growth came from improved G10.5+ demand and continued strength in mobile displays. The decrease from Q1FY22 is primarily due to softer mainstream demand, and lower G10.5+ demand that offset an increase in AMOLED. We believe
that strong demand for AMOLED photomasks used in mobile devices will continue, as expected technology advances drives increasing overall demand for higher-value masks.

Gross margin decreased by 2.2 percentage points in Q1 FY23, from Q4 FY22, despite a slight increase in revenue, primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix and
lower expediting premiums that customers pay to accelerate deliveries. Material costs increased 2.9% from the prior quarter, and increased, as a percentage of revenue, by 60 basis points. Labor costs remained flat, and as a percentage of
revenue. Equipment and other overhead costs increased 6.3% and increased 160 basis points as a percentage of revenue.
Gross margin increased by 4.5 percentage points in Q1 FY23, from Q1 FY22, primarily as a result of the increase in revenue from the prior year quarter. Material costs decreased 1.0% from the prior year
quarter, and decreased 301 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. Labor and benefits costs increased 14.2% from the prior year quarter and increased 30 basis points as a percent of revenue, as labor increased in both the U.S. and at
several Asia-based facilities, reflecting labor market conditions. Equipment and other overhead costs increased 4.5% but decreased 180 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. Increased outsourced manufacturing costs, partially offset by
decreased depreciation and equipment maintenance expenses, were the most significant contributors to the net increase in equipment and other overhead costs.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $16.8 million in Q1 FY23, compared with $15.7 million in Q4 FY22. The increase of $1.1 million was primarily the
result of increased compensation and related benefits and payroll tax expenses in the U.S. of $1.1 million. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million in Q1 FY23, from $15.7 million in Q1 FY22, primarily as a result
of increased compensation and related expenses of $0.9 million and increased professional fees of $0.2 million.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses, which primarily consist of development and qualification efforts related to process technologies for high-end IC and FPD applications, were $3.3 million
in Q1 FY23, $4.0 million in Q4 FY22, and $5.9 million in Q1 FY22. Research and development expenses decreased from all prior periods as a result of decreased development activities in the U.S.

Non-operating income (expense) decreased $25.2 million to $(14.4) million in Q1 FY23, compared with $10.8 million in Q4 FY22, primarily due to unfavorable movements
of the South Korean won and the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar exceeding a favorable movement of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Interest income and other income (expense) increased to $2.3 million in Q1 FY23, compared with $0.8
million in Q4 FY22, and $0.3 million in Q1 FY22 as a result of Treasury Securities purchased in Q4 FY22.
Non-operating income (expense) decreased $19.1 million to $(14.4) million in Q1 FY23, compared with $4.7 million in Q1 FY22. Unfavorable movement of the New Taiwan dollar and less favorable movement of the
South Korean won against the U.S. dollar exceeding favorable movements of the RMB were the primary drivers of the negative impact of foreign currency transactions. Interest expense decreased as a result of our lower average debt balance,
which decreased significantly as a result of early repayments made in FY22.

The effective income tax rate is sensitive to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, due in part to the non-recognition of tax benefits on losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances where the tax benefits
of the losses are not available.
The effective income tax rate increase in Q1 FY23, compared with Q4 FY22, is primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and an increase in foreign taxes in Q1 FY23.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $15.0 million in Q1 FY23, compared with $18.2 million in Q4 FY22, and $8.7 million in Q1 FY22. The increases from Q1 FY22 to Q1 FY23 resulted from
increased net income at our Taiwan-based and China-based IC joint ventures.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents
were $334.8 million and $319.7 million as of January 29, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively. As of the most recent balance sheet date, total cash and cash
equivalents included $315.7 million held by foreign subsidiaries. Net Cash, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed in the
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
section below, was $340.2 million
and $316.2 million as of January 29, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively.
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand, cash we generate from operations, and borrowing capacity we have
available from financial institutions.
Our corporate credit agreement has a $50 million borrowing limit, with an expansion capacity to $100 million. Although we have not accessed funds under our corporate credit facilities since
2011, it continues to afford us financial flexibility. In addition, in China, we
currently have approximately $25.0 million of borrowing capacity to support local operations. See Note 6 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information on our currently available financing.

We continually evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. These reviews may result in our engagement in a variety of investing and financing
transactions, in the transfer of cash among subsidiaries, and/or the repatriation of cash to the U.S. The transfer of funds among subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes; in certain jurisdictions, repatriation of these
funds to the U.S. may subject them to U.S. state income taxes and/or local country withholding taxes. We believe that our liquidity, including available financing, is sufficient to meet our requirements through the next twelve months and
thereafter for the foreseeable future. Through the utilization of our existing liquidity, cash we generate from operations, short-term investments, and (potentially) our borrowing capacity under our financing arrangements, we plan to continue
to invest in our business, with our investments targeted to align with our customers’ technology road maps. We may also elect to use our cash to reduce our debt through early repayments. In addition, we stand ready to invest in mergers,
acquisitions, or strategic partnerships, should a suitable opportunity arise.
We estimate capital expenditures for full year FY23 will be approximately $130 million; these investments will be targeted towards high-end and mainstream IC
capacity and
efficiency, and enable us to support our customers’ near-term demands.
As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding capital commitments of ap proximately $132.0 million and recognized liabilities
related to capital equipment purchases of approximately $14.9 million. Although
payment timing could vary, primarily as a result of the timing of tool delivery, installation, and testing, we currently
estimate that we will fund $61.0 million of our total $147.0 million committed and recognized obligations for capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Please refer to Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for
information on our outstanding debt.
In September 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of its common stock, pursuant to a repurchase plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Act.
This authorization does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock.
As of January 29, 2023, our current share repurchase program had approximately $31.7 million
remaining under its authorization. Depending on market conditions, we may utilize some or the entire remaining approved amount to reacquire additional
shares. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act
(“IRA”) was enacted in the U.S. Among other provisions, the IRA included a one percent excise tax on corporate share repurchases. The one percent excise tax on share repurchases applies to shares repurchased after December 31, 2022, and
excludes repurchases under $1 million. We do not anticipate that the IRA will have a material effect on our liquidity.
As discussed in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, DNP, the noncontrolling interest in our China-based joint venture has, under certain circumstances, the right to put
its interest in the joint venture to Photronics, or to purchase our interest in the joint venture. Under all such circumstances, the sale of DNP’s interest would be at its ownership percentage of the joint venture’s net book value, with
closing to take place within three business days of obtaining required approvals and clearance. As of the date of issuance of this report, DNP had not indicated its intention to exercise this right. As of January 29, 2023, Photronics and DNP
each had net investments in this joint venture of approximately $106.3 million.

Operating Activities:   Net cash provided by operating activities
reflects net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation
and amortization, share-based compensation, and the impacts of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $31.4 million in Q1 FY23, compared with Q1 FY22, due to decreased net
income and cash generated from changes in working capital.
Free Cash Flow and LTM (“Last Twelve Months”) Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures as discussed in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, decreased by $42.3 million
and increased by $45.9 million, respectively, compared with Q1 FY23, primarily due to the decrease in
Net cash provided by operating activities
discussed above and a reduction in spending on property,
plant, and equipment.
Investing Activities:   Net cash flows used in investing activities
primarily consisted of purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $31.1
million, which increased $11.9 million in Q1 FY23, compared with Q1 FY22. The increased spending on property, plant, and equipment was partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in investment related government incentives received in China.
Financing Activities:   Net cash flows used in financing activities
primarily consist of share repurchases, proceeds from and repayments of debt,
and contributions from noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities increased by $9.4 million in Q1 FY23, compared with Q1 FY22, primarily due to contributions from noncontrolling interests in our majority owned
subsidiaries in Taiwan and China of $15.0 million in Q1 FY22 and decreased debt repayments of $6.0 million.
The increase in our cash balance from Q1 FY22 was favorably impacted by the effects of exchange rate changes in the amount of $27.5 million in Q1 FY23, which was in contrast to the $2.0
million unfavorable impact the effects of exchange rate changes had on our cash balance in Q1 FY22.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP Net Income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders and non-GAAP earnings per share, Free Cash Flow, LTM Free Cash Flow, and Net Cash are "non-GAAP financial measures" as such
term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and may differ from similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The financial tables below reconcile Photronics, Inc. financial results under GAAP to non-GAAP
financial information. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of our projected
performance with our historical results. These non-GAAP metrics are not intended to represent funds available for our discretionary use and are not intended to represent, or be used as a substitute for, net income attributable to Photronics,
Inc. shareholders, diluted earnings per share, cash and cash equivalents, or cash flows from operations, as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent,
are significant components of the condensed consolidated statements of income, condensed consolidated balance sheets and statement of cash flows and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.

Business Outlook
Our current business outlook and guidance was provided in the Photronics Q1 FY23 earnings release, earnings presentation, and financial results conference call, but is not incorporated herein.
These can be accessed in the investor section of our website - www.photronics.com.
Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this filing and in the Photronics Q1 FY23 earnings presentation and the related financial results
conference call and slide deck involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2022 Form 10-K. A number of other unforeseeable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K for discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates since the filing of our Form 10-K for
the year ended October 31, 2022.
Item 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We conduct business in several major international currencies throughout our worldwide operations, and our financial performance may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of these
currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect our reported revenue, operating income, assets, liabilities, and equity. The functional currencies of our Asian subsidiaries are the South Korean won, the New Taiwan
dollar, the RMB, and the Singapore dollar. The functional currencies of our European subsidiaries are the British pound and the euro. In addition, we engage in transactions in, and have exposures to, the Japanese yen.
We attempt to minimize our risk of foreign currency transaction losses by producing products in the same country in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring
expenses in the same currency), and by managing our working capital. However, in some instances, we sell products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced, or purchase products in a currency that
differs from the functional currency of the purchasing entity. We may also enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations when we have a significant purchase obligation, or a significant receivable
denominated in a currency that differs from the functional currency of the transacting subsidiary. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. There can be no assurance that this approach will protect us from the need to
recognize significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses, especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currency in which we conduct business against any of our functional currencies,
including the U.S. dollar.
32
Table of Contents
Our primary net foreign currency exposures as of January 29, 2023, included the South Korean won, the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the RMB, the Singapore dollar, the British pound
sterling, and the euro. As of that date, a 10% adverse movement in the value of currencies different from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries would have resulted in a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $42.1 million, which represents an
increase of $7.4 million from our exposure at October 31, 2022. Our most significant exposures at January 29, 2023, were exposures of the South Korean won, the RMB, and the New Taiwan Dollar to the U.S. dollar, which were, respectively, $11.8
million, $10.7 million, and $16.6 million at that date. We do not believe that a 10% change in the exchange rates of non-US dollar currencies, other than the aforementioned currencies and the Japanese yen, would have had a material effect on
our January 29, 2023, condensed consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk
A 10% adverse movement in the interest rates on our variable rate borrowings would not have had a material effect on our January 29, 2023, condensed consolidated financial statements.
Item 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established, and currently maintain, disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the first fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
