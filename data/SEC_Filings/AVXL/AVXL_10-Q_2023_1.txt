Note 1 	 Business Description
Business
Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (“Anavex” or
the “Company”) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics by
applying precision medicine to central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases with high unmet need. Anavex analyzes genomic data
from clinical trials to identify biomarkers, which are used in the analysis of its clinical trials for the treatment of neurodegenerative
and neurodevelopmental diseases.
The Company’s lead compound ANAVEX ® 2-73
is being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases,
including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a rare severe neurological monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene,
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (“MECP2”).
Note 2 	 Basis of Presentation
Basis of Presentation
These accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim reporting. Accordingly,
certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.
These accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary
for fair presentation of the information contained herein. The consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 was derived from the
audited annual financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on November 28, 2022. The Company
follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.
Operating results for the three months ended December
31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023.
Liquidity
All of the Company’s potential drug compounds
are in the clinical development stage and the Company cannot be certain that its research and development efforts will be successful or,
if successful, that its potential drug compounds will ever be approved for sales to pharmaceutical companies or generate commercial revenues.
To date, we have not generated any revenues from our operations. The Company expects the business to continue to experience negative cash
flows from operations for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, our business might become profitable.

Notes
to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December
31, 2022
(Unaudited)
Management believes that the current working capital
position will be sufficient to meet the Company’s working capital requirements beyond the next 12 months after the date that these
interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The process of drug development can be costly, and the timing and outcomes
of clinical trials are uncertain. The assumptions upon which the Company has based its estimates are routinely evaluated and may
be subject to change. The actual amount of the Company’s expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors including
but not limited to the design, timing and duration of future clinical trials, the progress of the Company’s research and development
programs and the level of financial resources available. The Company has the ability to adjust its operating plan spending levels based
on the timing of future clinical trials.
Other than our rights related to the Sales Agreement
(as defined below in Note 5), there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available,
that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If the Company is not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis,
if and when it is needed, it will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of its research and development activities.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions related to accounting for research and development costs, incentive income receivable, valuation and recoverability
of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts,
historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not
readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will
be affected.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
The global pandemic resulting
from the disease known as COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, did not have a material impact on the Company’s result
of operations or financial condition for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. However, the future course of the pandemic could have adverse
effects in the U.S and global economies and thus negatively impact our business and financial results.
Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Anavex Life Sciences Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Anavex Australia Pty Limited (“Anavex Australia”),
a company incorporated under the laws of Australia, Anavex Germany GmbH, a company incorporated under the laws of Germany, and Anavex
Canada Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. All inter-company transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three
levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which
are the following:
Level 1 - 	quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active 		markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and
Level 3 - 	assets and liabilities whose significant
value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company
did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities.
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
Basic income/(loss) per common share is computed by
dividing net income/(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common stockholders by the sum of (1) the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, (2) the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of options and
warrants using the treasury stock method and (3) the dilutive effect of other potentially dilutive securities. For purposes of the diluted
net loss per share calculation, options and warrants are potentially dilutive securities and are excluded from the calculation of diluted
net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
As of December 31, 2022 loss per share excludes
13,525,296
(December 31, 2021:
11,403,769 ) potentially dilutive common shares related to outstanding options and warrants, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements
In November 2021, the FASB
issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance” (“ASU 2021-10”).
ASU 2021-10 increases the disclosure requirements for annual reporting periods relating to material government assistance transactions
on the entity’s financial statements and any significant terms and conditions of the agreements including commitments and contingencies.
The new standard was effective for the Company on October 1, 2022 but only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures. The
adoption of ASU 2021-10 is expected to impact the disclosures related to the research and development incentive income that the Company
receives from the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) for its clinical trials in Australia.
Note 3	 Other Income
Grant Income
As of December 31, 2022,

shares, subject to adjustment in the event of a change of the Company’s capitalization.
2019 Stock Option Plan
On January 15, 2019, the Board approved the 2019 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), which provides for the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards to directors,
officers, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company.
The maximum number of our common shares reserved for
issue under the plan was
6,000,000
shares, subject to adjustment in the event of a change of the Company’s capitalization.
During the year ended September 30, 2022,
406,453
options previously available under the 2019 Plan and the 2015 Plan became available under the 2022 Plan (as defined below).
2022 Stock Option Plan
On March 25, 2022, the Board approved the 2022 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”). The 2022 Plan was approved by stockholders on May 24, 2022. Under the terms of the 2022
Plan,
10,000,000
additional shares of Common Stock will be available for issuance under the plan. Any awards outstanding under a previous
stock option plan will remain subject to and be paid under such plan, and any shares subject to outstanding awards under a previous plan
that subsequently cease to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of settlement of the awards in shares) will automatically become
available for issuance under the 2022 Plan.
The 2022 Plan provides that it may be administered
by the Board, or the Board may delegate such responsibility to a committee. The exercise price will be determined by the Board at the
time of grant and shall be at least equal to the fair market value on such date. If the grantee is a 10% stockholder on the grant date,
then the exercise price shall not be less than 110% of fair market value of the Company’s shares of common stock on the grant date.
Stock options may be granted under the 2022 Plan for an exercise period of up to ten years from the date of grant of the option or such
lesser periods as may be determined by the Board, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Plan. At December

Our Current Business
Anavex Life Sciences Corp. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical
company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics by applying precision medicine to central nervous system (“CNS”)
diseases with high unmet need. We analyze genomic data from clinical trials to identify biomarkers, which we use in the analysis of our
clinical trials.
Our lead product candidate, ANAVEX ® 2-73,
is being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases,
including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a rare severe neurological monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene,
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (“MECP2”).
We currently have two core programs and two seed programs.
Our core programs are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development, in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
The following table summarizes key information about our programs:
* = Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA; Dashed
lines indicate planned clinical trials to-date
Anavex has a portfolio of compounds varying in sigma-1
receptor (SIGMAR1) binding activities. The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the SIGMAR1 protein, which is an intracellular chaperone protein with
important roles in cellular communication. SIGMAR1 is also involved in transcriptional regulation at the nuclear envelope and restores
homeostasis and stimulates recovery of cell function when activated. In order to validate the ability of our compounds to activate quantitatively
the SIGMAR1, we performed, in collaboration with Stanford University, a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan in
mice, which demonstrated a dose-dependent ANAVEX ® 2-73 target engagement or receptor occupancy with SIGMAR1 in the brain.

al., Sci Rep. 2021 Aug 25; 11(1):17150
Cellular Homeostasis
Many diseases are possibly directly caused by chronic
homeostatic imbalances or cellular stress of brain cells. In pediatric diseases, such as Rett syndrome or infantile spasms, the chronic
cellular stress is possibly caused by the presence of a constant genetic mutation. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases, chronic cellular stress is possibly caused by age-correlated buildup of cellular insult and hence chronic
cellular stress. Specifically, defects in homeostasis of protein or ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) lead to the death of neurons
and dysfunction of the nervous system. The spreading of protein aggregates resulting in a proteinopathy, a characteristic found in Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases that results from disorders of protein synthesis, trafficking, folding, processing or degradation in cells.
The clearance of macromolecules in the brain is particularly susceptible to imbalances that result in aggregation and degeneration in
nerve cells. For example, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary
tangles, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that are a marker of other diseases known as tauopathies as well as inflammation
of microglia. With the SIGMAR1 activation through SIGMAR1 agonists like ANAVEX ® 2-73, our approach is to restore cellular
balance (i.e. homeostasis). Therapies that correct defects in cellular homeostasis might have the potential to halt or delay neurodevelopmental
and neurodegenerative disease progression.
3
ANAVEX ® 2-73-specific Biomarkers
As part of some of our clinical trials, we have incorporated
a genomic analysis to better understand potential populations for whom our clinical programs might benefit. In our clinical trials, a
full genomic analysis of Alzheimer’s disease patients treated with ANAVEX ® 2-73 has helped us identify actionable
genetic variants. A significant impact of the genomic biomarkers SIGMAR1, the direct target of ANAVEX ® 2-73 and COMT, a
gene involved in memory function, on the drug response level was identified, leading to an early ANAVEX ® 2-73-specific biomarker
hypothesis. We believe that
excluding
patients with SIGMAR1 identified biomarker variant (approximately 10%-20% of the population)
in prospective studies would identify approximately 80%-90% patients that would display clinically significant improved functional and
cognitive scores. The consistency between the identified DNA and RNA data related to ANAVEX ® 2-73, which are considered
independent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, as well as multiple endpoints and time-points, provides support for the potential
precision medicine clinical development of ANAVEX ® 2-73 by using genetic biomarkers identified within the trial population
itself to target patients who are most likely to respond to ANAVEX ® 2-73 treatment. We may in the future utilize such an
approach in Alzheimer’s disease as well as indications like Parkinson’s disease dementia or Rett syndrome in which ANAVEX ® 2-73
is currently being studied.
Clinical Trials Overview
Alzheimer’s Disease
In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2a clinical
trial, consisting of Part A and Part B, which lasted a total of 57 weeks, for ANAVEX ® 2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s
patients. This open-label randomized trial in Australia met both primary and secondary endpoints and was designed to assess the safety
and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX ® 2-73 in 32 patients. ANAVEX ® 2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors,
which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse
the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer’s disease. In October 2017, we presented positive pharmacokinetic (“PK”)
and pharmacodynamic (“PD”) data from the Phase 2a clinical trial, which established a concentration-effect relationship between
ANAVEX ® 2-73 and trial measurements. These measures obtained from all patients who participated in the entire 57 weeks include
exploratory cognitive and functional scores as well as biomarker signals of brain activity. Additionally, the clinical trial appeared
to show that ANAVEX ® 2-73 activity was enhanced by its active metabolite (ANAVEX19-144), which also targets the SIGMAR1
receptor and has a half-life approximately twice as long as the parent molecule.
Two consecutive trial extensions for the Phase 2a
trial have allowed participants who completed the 52-week Part B of the trial to continue taking ANAVEX ® 2-73, providing
an opportunity to gather extended safety data for a cumulative time period of five years. In August 2020, patients completing these Phase
2a trial extensions were granted continued access to treatment with ANAVEX ® 2-73 through the Australian Government Department
of Health – Therapeutic Goods Administration’s compassionate use Special Access Scheme.
A larger Phase 2b/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73 in Alzheimer’s disease commenced in August 2018. The Phase 2b/3 trial enrolled 509 patients,
which were treated with a convenient once-daily oral formulation of ANAVEX ® 2-73 for 48 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different
ANAVEX ® 2-73 doses or placebo. The trial took place at 52 sites across North America, Europe and Australia. Primary and
secondary endpoints to assess safety and both cognitive and functional efficacy, were measured through the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment
Scale – Cognitive Subscale test (“ADAS-Cog”), Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily
Living (“ADCS-ADL”) and Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes for cognition and function (“CDR-SB”). In
addition to the primary endpoints, the ANAVEX ® 2-73 Phase 2b/3 trial design incorporated pre-specified statistical analyses
related to potential genomic precision medicine biomarkers previously identified in the ANAVEX ® 2-73 Phase 2a clinical trial.
The trial completed in mid-2022 and, in December 2022, the Company presented positive topline results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial.

ANAVEX ® 2-73 met the co-primary endpoints
ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL and key secondary endpoint CDR-SB. ANAVEX ® 2-73 treatment slowed decline of cognition and function
in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease over 48 weeks. Patients treated with ANAVEX ® 2-73 had 1.84 times higher
odds, or likelihood, to improve cognitively compared to placebo, with a ADAS-Cog score threshold change of -0.5 points or better [Odds
Ratio = 1.84 (p = 0.015)]. At clinically significant levels of improvement in function (ADCS-ADL score threshold change of +3.5 points
or better), patients treated with ANAVEX ® 2-73 had 2.67 times higher odds, or likelihood, to improve function compared to
placebo [Odds Ratio = 2.67 (p = 0.0255)]. Additionally, treatment with ANAVEX ® 2-73 reduced cognitive decline at end of
treatment, measured with the ADAS-Cog, as compared to placebo, by 45%, representing a treatment difference in mean score change of -1.85
points (p=0.033). Compared to placebo, ANAVEX ® 2-73 reduced clinical decline of cognition and function by 27% with mean
score difference of -0.42 points (p=0.040) as measured by the CDR-SB. ANAVEX ® 2-73 was generally safe and well tolerated.
All statistical analyses were performed by outside consultancy companies.
In October 2019, we initiated a long-term open label
extension study of ANAVEX ® 2-73, entitled the ATTENTION-AD trial, for patients who have completed the 48-week Phase 2b/3
placebo-controlled trial referenced above. This trial extension for an additional two years gives patients the opportunity to continue
their treatment.
Rett Syndrome
In February 2016, we presented positive preclinical
data for ANAVEX ® 2-73 in Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease. The data demonstrated dose related and significant
improvements in an array of behavioral and gait paradigms in a mouse model with an MECP2-null mutation that causes neurological symptoms
that mimic Rett syndrome. The study was funded by the International Rett Syndrome Foundation (“Rettsyndrome.org”). In January
2017, we were awarded a financial grant from Rettsyndrome.org of a minimum of $0.6 million to cover some of the costs of a multicenter
Phase 2 clinical trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. This award was received in quarterly instalments
which commenced during fiscal 2018.
In March 2019, we commenced the first Phase 2 clinical
trial in a planned Rett syndrome program of ANAVEX ® 2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The clinical trials are being
conducted in a range of patient age demographics and geographic regions, utilizing an oral liquid once-daily formulation of ANAVEX ® 2-73.
The first Phase 2 trial, (ANAVEX ® 2-73-RS-001),
which took place in the United States, was completed in December 2020. This trial was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled safety,
tolerability, PK and efficacy trial of oral liquid ANAVEX ® 2-73 formulation in 25 adult female patients with Rett syndrome
over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX ® 2-73-specific genomic precision medicine biomarkers. The primary endpoint
of the trial was safety. The dosing of 5 mg ANAVEX ® 2-73 was well-tolerated and demonstrated dose-proportional PK. All secondary
efficacy endpoints of the trial showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful response in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire
(“RSBQ”) response, when compared to placebo, in the intent to treat (“ITT”) cohort (all participants, p = 0.011).
66.7% of ANAVEX ® 2-73 treated subjects showed a statistically significant improvement in RSBQ response as compared to 10%
of the subjects on placebo in the ITT cohort (all participants, p = 0.011). ANAVEX ® 2-73 treatment resulted in a sustained
improvement in Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) response throughout the 7-week clinical trial, when compared to placebo
in the ITT cohort (all participants, p = 0.014). Consistent with previous ANAVEX ® 2-73 clinical trials, patients carrying
the common form of the SIGMAR1 gene treated with ANAVEX ® 2-73 experienced stronger improvements in the prespecified efficacy
endpoints.
The
second, international trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the AVATAR trial, commenced in June
2019.
This trial took place in Australia and the United Kingdom using a higher dose than the U.S. based Phase 2 trial for Rett
syndrome. The trial was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX ® 2-73
in 33 adult patients over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX ® 2-73 specific precision medicine biomarkers. Based
upon the input from the successful U.S. Phase 2 Rett syndrome trial (ANAVEX ® 2-73-RS-001), we updated the endpoints for
the AVATAR trial (ANAVEX ® 2-73-RS-002) to appropriately assess the clinically meaningful outcome following International
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. These updates were approved by the respective regulatory authorities in the U.K. and in
Australia, respectively, where the AVATAR trial was conducted.
5
The data from the AVATAR trial was released in February
2022. The clinical trial met all primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints, with consistent improvements in primary efficacy
endpoint, RSBQ response (p = 0.037), and secondary efficacy endpoints, ADAMS (p = 0.010) and CGI-I (p = 0.037) response. Efficacy endpoints
demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in Rett syndrome symptoms. Convenient once daily oral liquid
doses of up to 30 mg of ANAVEX ® 2-73 were also well tolerated with good medication compliance. All patients who participated
in the trial were eligible to receive ANAVEX ® 2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol.
In July 2020, we commenced the third trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73
for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the EXCELLENCE trial. This Phase 2/3 trial in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome includes
trial sites in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX ® 2-73 in approximately
84 pediatric patients, aged 5 to 18, over a 12-week treatment period incorporating ANAVEX ® 2-73 specific precision medicine
biomarkers. This trial completed enrollment in February 2023, exceeding the original
enrollment target and topline results are expected in the second half of 2023. All patients who participate in the trial will be eligible to receive ANAVEX ® 2-73 under a voluntary open label
extension protocol, which is currently ongoing.
Parkinson’s Disease
In September 2016, we presented positive preclinical
data for ANAVEX ® 2-73 in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease, which demonstrated significant improvements on behavioral,
histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. The study was funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Additional data announced in
October 2017 indicated that ANAVEX ® 2-73 induced robust neurorestoration in experimental Parkinsonism. We believe the encouraging
results we have gathered in this preclinical model, coupled with the favorable profile of this product candidate in the Alzheimer’s
disease trial, support the notion that ANAVEX ® 2-73 has the potential to treat Parkinson’s disease dementia.
In October 2020, we completed a double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX ® 2-73 in Parkinson’s disease dementia in Spain and Australia,
to study the effect of the compound on both the cognitive and motor impairment of Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 2 trial enrolled
approximately 132 patients for 14 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX ® 2-73 doses, 30 mg and 50 mg, or placebo.
The ANAVEX ® 2-73 Phase 2 Parkinson’s disease dementia trial design incorporated genomic precision medicine biomarkers
identified in the ANAVEX ® 2-73 Phase 2a Alzheimer’s disease trial.
The trial demonstrated that ANAVEX ® 2-73
was safe and well tolerated in oral doses up to 50 mg once daily. The results showed clinically meaningful, dose-dependent, and statistically
significant improvements in the Cognitive Drug Research (“CDR”) computerized assessment system analysis. Treatment with ANAVEX ® 2-73
also resulted in clinically meaningful improvements as measured by the global composite score of Parkinson’s disease symptom severity,
MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale total score on top of standard of care including dopaminergic therapy, levodopa and
other anti-PD medications after 14 weeks of treatment, suggesting ANAVEX ® 2-73’s potential capability of slowing and
reversing symptoms that progress in Parkinson’s disease. In addition, the trial confirmed the precision medicine approach of targeting
SIGMAR1 as a genetic biomarker in response to ANAVEX ® 2-73 may result in improved clinical outcomes.
In January 2021, we were awarded a research grant
of $1.0 million from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research to develop ANAVEX ® 2-73 for
the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The award will explore utilization of PET imaging biomarkers to enable measurement of target
engagement and pathway activation of the SIGMAR1 with clinically relevant doses including in people with Parkinson’s disease.
Frontotemporal Dementia
In July 2020, we commenced the First-in-Human Phase
1 clinical trial of ANAVEX ® 3-71. ANAVEX ® 3-71 was previously granted orphan drug designation for the treatment
of Frontotemporal Dementia (“FTD”) by the FDA. ANAVEX ® 3-71 is an orally administered small molecule targeting
sigma-1 and M1 muscarinic receptors that is designed to be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases. In preclinical studies,
ANAVEX ® 3-71
demonstrated disease-modifying activity against the major hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including
cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as beneficial effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.
6
The Phase 1
clinical trial was a prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Australia. A total of 36 healthy male and female
subjects were included. Single escalating doses of ANAVEX ® 3-71 were administered in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
and PK of ANAVEX ® 3-71 and the effects of food and gender on its PK in healthy volunteers.
The trial met
its primary and secondary endpoints of safety, with no serious adverse events (“SAEs”) or dose-limiting toxicities observed.
ANAVEX ® 3-71 was well tolerated in all cohorts receiving ANAVEX ® 3-71 in single doses ranging from 5 mg to
200 mg daily with no SAEs and no significant lab abnormalities in any subject. In the trial, ANAVEX ® 3-71 exhibited linear
PK. Its pharmacokinetics was also dose proportional for doses up to 160 mg. Gender had no effect on the PK of the drug and food had no
effect on the bioavailability of ANAVEX ® 3-71. The trial also met the secondary objective of characterizing the effect of
ANAVEX ® 3-71 on electrocardiogram (“ECG”) parameters. There were no clinically significant ECG parameters throughout
the trial. Participant QTcF measures were normal across all dose groups with no difference between ANAVEX ® 3-71 and placebo.
Based on these
results, and ANAVEX ® 3-71’s pre-clinical profile, we intend to advance ANAVEX ® 3-71 into a biomarker-driven
clinical development dementia program for the treatment of schizophrenia, FTD and Alzheimer’s disease, evaluating longitudinal effect
of treatment with ANAVEX ® 3-71. We believe the results of these clinical trials and preclinical study could serve as a basis
for advancing into respective registration trials in the U.S.
Our Pipeline
Our research and development pipeline includes ANAVEX ® 2-73
currently in three different clinical trial indications, and several other compounds in different stages of clinical and pre-clinical
development.
Our proprietary SIGMACEPTOR™ Discovery Platform
produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may
be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, both of neurodegenerative nature, including Alzheimer’s disease, as well
as of neurodevelopmental nature, like Rett syndrome. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning
of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease. Multiple viruses including SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-19) induce cellular stress by intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis and other related cellular processes, in order to ensure survival
and replication. Hence, it is possible that SIGMAR1 could play a role in modulating the cellular response to viral infection and ameliorate
pathogenesis.
Compounds that have been subjects of our research
include the following:
ANAVEX ® 2-73
(blarcamesine)
We believe ANAVEX ® 2-73 may offer a
disease-modifying approach in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases by activation of SIGMAR1. ANAVEX ® 2-73 is
being developed in an oral liquid once-daily formulation for rare diseases such as Rett syndrome as well as an oral once-daily capsule
formulation for diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.
In Rett syndrome, administration of ANAVEX ® 2-73
in liquid form resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome
disease model. In addition, in a further experiment sponsored by Rettsyndrome.org, ANAVEX ® 2-73 was evaluated in automatic
visual response and respiration tests in 7-month old mice, an age at which advanced pathology is evident. Vehicle-treated MECP2 mice demonstrated
fewer automatic visual responses than wild-type mice. Treatment with ANAVEX ® 2-73 for four weeks significantly increased
the automatic visual response in the MECP2 Rett syndrome disease mice. Additionally, chronic oral dosing daily for 6.5 weeks of ANAVEX ® 2-73
starting at ~5.5 weeks of age was conducted in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease mouse model assessed the different aspects of muscular
coordination, balance, motor learning and muscular strengths, some of the core deficits observed in Rett syndrome. Administration of ANAVEX ® 2-73
resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of these behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease
model.
7
In May 2016 and June 2016, the FDA granted Orphan
Drug Designation to ANAVEX ® 2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and infantile spasms, respectively. In November 2019,
the FDA granted to ANAVEX ® 2-73 the Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The RPD
designation is intended to encourage the development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases.
Further, in February 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track
designation for the ANAVEX ® 2-73 clinical development program for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The FDA Fast Track program
is designed to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious
and life-threatening conditions.
For Parkinson’s disease, data demonstrates significant
improvements and restoration of function in a disease modifying animal model of Parkinson’s disease. Significant improvements were
seen on all measures tested: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. In October 2020, we completed a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX ® 2-73 in Parkinson’s disease dementia, to
study the effect of the compound on both the cognitive and motor impairment of Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 2 trial enrolled approximately
132 patients for 14 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX ® 2-73 doses, 30mg and 50mg, or placebo. The ANAVEX ® 2-73
Phase 2 Parkinson’s disease dementia trial design incorporated genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX ® 2-73
Phase 2a Alzheimer’s disease trial.
The trial demonstrated that ANAVEX ® 2-73
was safe and well tolerated in oral doses up to 50mg once daily. The results showed clinically meaningful, dose-dependent, and statistically
significant improvements in the CDR computerized assessment system analysis. We anticipate conducting further clinical trials of ANAVEX ® 2-73
in Parkinson’s disease dementia after submitting the results of the trial to the FDA to obtain regulatory guidance.
In Alzheimer’s disease animal models, ANAVEX ® 2-73
has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive
therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to SIGMAR1 and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX ® 2-73
has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact amyloid, tau pathology and inflammation. In a transgenic Alzheimer’s disease
animal model Tg2576, ANAVEX ® 2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of
oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that
is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals,
regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory.
Based on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated
and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum
tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse
models of Alzheimer’s disease. There were no significant changes in laboratory or ECG parameters. ANAVEX ® 2-73 was
well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum
tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen
with drugs that target CNS conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease.
In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2a clinical
trial for ANAVEX ® 2-73, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The open-label randomized trial was designed to
assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX ® 2-73 in 32 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
The Phase 2a trial met both primary and secondary objectives of the trial.
8
In July 2018, we presented
the results of a genomic DNA and RNA evaluation of the participants in the Phase 2a clinical trial. More than 33,000 genes were analyzed
using unbiased, data driven, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) system for analyzing DNA and RNA data in patients treated
with ANAVEX ® 2-73. The analysis identified genetic variants that impacted response to ANAVEX ® 2-73, among
them variants related to the SIGMAR1, the target for ANAVEX ® 2-73. Results showed that trial participants with the common
SIGMAR1 wild type gene variant, which is estimated to be about 80% of the population worldwide, demonstrated improved cognitive (MMSE)
and the functional (ADCS-ADL) scores. The results from this evaluation supported the continued evaluation of genomic information in subsequent
clinical trials, since these signatures can now be applied to neurological indications tested in future clinical trials with ANAVEX ® 2-73
including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia and Rett syndrome.
ANAVEX ® 2-73
data met prerequisite information in order to progress into a Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled trial. On July 2, 2018, the Human Research
Ethics Committee in Australia approved the initiation of our Phase 2b/3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 48-week safety and
efficacy trial of ANAVEX ® 2-73 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease. Clinical trial sites in Canada, the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany were also added. This Phase 2b/3 trial design incorporates inclusion of genomic precision
medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX ® 2-73 Phase 2a trial.
The trial completed and, in December 2022, the Company
presented positive topline results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. ANAVEX ® 2-73 met the co-primary endpoints ADAS-Cog
and ADCS-ADL and key secondary endpoint CDR-SB as further described above under
Clinical Trials Overview – Alzheimer’s
Disease.
We believe preclinical data from our studies also
supports further research into the use of ANAVEX ® 2-73 as a potential platform drug for other neurodegenerative diseases
beyond Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or Rett syndrome, more specifically, epilepsy, infantile spasms, Fragile X
syndrome, Angelman syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and, more recently, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). ANAVEX ® 2-73 demonstrated
significant improvements in all of these indications in the respective preclinical animal models.
In a preclinical study sponsored by the Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome, ANAVEX ® 2-73 was assessed in a mouse model for the development of audiogenic seizures. The results
indicated that ANAVEX ® 2-73 administration significantly reduced audiogenic-induced seizures in mice. In a study sponsored
by FRAXA Research Foundation regarding Fragile X syndrome, data demonstrated that ANAVEX ® 2-73 restored hippocampal brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression to normal levels. BDNF under-expression has been observed in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
pathologies. BDNF signaling promotes maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. ANAVEX ® 2-73 normalization of
BDNF expression could be a contributing factor for the positive preclinical data observed in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders like Angelman and Fragile X syndromes.
In addition, preclinical data to-date also indicates
that ANAVEX ® 2-73 has the potential to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological
conditions, which, if impaired, may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
In addition, preclinical data on ANAVEX ® 2-73
related to multiple sclerosis indicates that ANAVEX ® 2-73 may promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis disease. Further,
our data also demonstrates that ANAVEX ® 2-73 has the potential to provide protection for oligodendrocytes (“OL’s”)
and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (“OPC’s”), as well as central nervous system neurons in addition to helping repair
by increasing OPC proliferation and maturation in tissue culture.
In March 2018, we presented preclinical data of ANAVEX ® 2-73
in a genetic mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (“TSC”). TSC is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth
of numerous benign tumors in many parts of the body with a high incidence of seizures. The preclinical data demonstrated that treatment
with ANAVEX ® 2-73 significantly increased survival and reduced seizures in those mice.
9
ANAVEX ® 3-71
ANAVEX ® 3-71 is a clinical drug candidate
with a novel mechanism of action via SIGMAR1 activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has been shown to enhance neuroprotection
and cognition in Alzheimer’s disease models. ANAVEX ® 3-71 is a CNS-penetrable potential disease modifying treatment
for cognitive impairments. We believe it is effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimer’s hallmarks in transgenic
(3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial
dysfunctions. ANAVEX ® 3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimer’s and other protein-aggregation-related
diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via SIGMAR1 activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation.
A preclinical study examined the response of ANAVEX ® 3-71
in aged transgenic animal models and showed a significant reduction in the rate of cognitive deficit, amyloid beta pathology and inflammation
with the administration of ANAVEX ® 3-71. In April 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX ® 3-71
for the treatment of FTD.
During pathological conditions ANAVEX ® 3-71
demonstrated the formation of new synapses between neurons (synaptogenesis) without causing an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes.
In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, synaptogenesis is believed to be impaired. Additional
preclinical data presented also indicates that in addition to reducing oxidative stress, ANAVEX ® 3-71 has the potential
to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to
play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
In July 2020, we commenced the first Phase 1 clinical
trial of ANAVEX ® 3-71. The trial took place in Australia and was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase
1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability, and PK of oral escalating doses of ANAVEX ® 3-71
including effects of food and gender in healthy volunteers.
The trial met its primary and secondary
endpoints of safety, respectively, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose-limiting toxicities observed,
as more fully described
above under
Clinical Trials Overview – Frontotemporal Dementia .
Based on these
results, and ANAVEX ® 3-71 pre-clinical profile, the Company intends to advance ANAVEX ® 3-71 into a biomarker-driven
clinical development dementia program for the treatment of schizophrenia, FTD and Alzheimer’s disease, evaluating longitudinal effect
of treatment with ANAVEX ® 3-71. We believe the results of this clinical trial and preclinical study could serve as a basis
for advancing into respective registration trials in the U.S.
ANAVEX ® 1-41
ANAVEX ® 1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical
tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of
endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and impairs cell viability. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX ® 1-41
prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus,
the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and SIGMAR1 systems through
a novel mechanism of action.
Preclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX ® 1-41
has the potential to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired,
are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
10
ANAVEX ® 1066
ANAVEX ® 1066, a mixed sigma-1/sigma-2
ligand, is designed for the potential treatment of neuropathic and visceral pain. ANAVEX ® 1066 was tested in two preclinical
models of neuropathic and visceral pain that have been extensively validated in rats. In the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic
pain, a single oral administration of ANAVEX ® 1066 dose-dependently restored the nociceptive threshold in the affected paw
to normal levels while leaving the contralateral healthy paw unchanged. Efficacy was rapid and remained significant for two hours. In
a model of visceral pain, chronic colonic hypersensitivity was induced by injection of an inflammatory agent directly into the colon and
a single oral administration of ANAVEX ® 1066 returned the nociceptive threshold to control levels in a dose-dependent manner.
Companion studies in rats demonstrated the lack of any effects on normal gastrointestinal transit with ANAVEX ® 1066 and
a favorable safety profile in a battery of behavioral measures.
ANAVEX ® 1037
ANAVEX ® 1037 is designed for the treatment
of prostate and pancreatic cancer. It is a low molecular weight, synthetic compound exhibiting high affinity for SIGMAR1 at nanomolar
levels and moderate affinity for sigma-2 receptors and sodium channels at micromolar levels. In advanced pre-clinical studies, this compound
revealed antitumor potential. It has also been shown to selectively kill human cancer cells without affecting normal/healthy cells and
also to significantly suppress tumor growth in immune-deficient mice models. Scientific publications highlight the possibility that these
ligands may stop tumor growth and induce selective cell death in various tumor cell lines. Sigma receptors are highly expressed in different
tumor cell types. Binding by appropriate sigma-1 and/or sigma-2 ligands can induce selective apoptosis. In addition, through tumor cell
membrane reorganization and interactions with ion channels, we believe our drug candidates may play an important role in inhibiting the
processes of metastasis (spreading of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body), angiogenesis (the formation of
new blood vessels) and tumor cell proliferation.
ANAVEX ® 1037 is currently in the pre-clinical
and clinical testing stages of development, and there is no guarantee that the activity demonstrated in pre-clinical models will be shown
in human testing.
We continue to identify and initiate discussions with
potential strategic and commercial partners to most effectively advance our programs and increase stockholder value. Further, we may acquire
or develop new intellectual property and assign, license, or otherwise transfer our intellectual property to further our goals.
Our Target Indications
We are developing compounds with potential application
to two broad categories and several specific indications, including:
Central Nervous System Diseases
●
Alzheimer’s disease – In 2022, an estimated 6.5 million Americans were suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The Alzheimer’s Association ®
estimates that by 2050, this number is expected to rise to 12.7 million Americans. Medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. We believe that there is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease modifying cure for Alzheimer’s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments.
●
Parkinson’s disease – Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow, imprecise movement. It is associated with degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain and a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinson’s disease currently is estimated to afflict more than 10 million people worldwide, typically middle-aged and elderly people. The Parkinson’s disease market is expected to reach $11.5 billion by 2029, according to GlobalData.
11
●
Rett syndrome – Rett syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, including protein transcription, which is altered and as a result leads to severe disruptions in neuronal homeostasis. It is considered a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and is caused by a single mutation in the MECP2 gene. Because males have a different chromosome combination from females, boys who have the genetic MECP2 mutation are affected in devastating ways. Most of them die before birth or in early infancy. For females who survive infancy, Rett syndrome leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child’s life; severe mental retardation, their ability to speak, walk and eat, sleeping problems, seizures and even the ability to breathe easily. Rett syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 females.
●
Depression – Depression is a major cause of morbidity worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The global antidepressant drug market is projected to reach $21 Billion by 2030 according to Allied Market Research. Pharmaceutical treatment for depression has been historically dominated by blockbuster brands. However, the dominance of the leading brands is waning, largely due to an increase in the number of approvals for antidepressant drugs.
●
Epilepsy – Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015 epilepsy affected 3.4 million Americans. Today, epilepsy is often controlled, but not cured, with medication that is categorized as older traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. Because epilepsy afflicts sufferers in different ways, there is a need for drugs used in combination with both traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs.
●
Neuropathic Pain – We define neuralgia, or neuropathic pain, as pain that is not related to activation of pain receptor cells in any part of the body. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than some other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants.
Cancer
●
Malignant Melanoma – Predominantly a skin cancer, malignant melanoma can also occur in melanocytes found in the bowel and the eye. Malignant melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor, adjuvant treatment, chemo and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to iHealthcareAnalyst, Inc. the worldwide malignant melanoma market is expected to grow to $7.5 billion by 2029.
●
Prostate Cancer – Specific to men, prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Cancer cells may metastasize from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes.

We regard patents and other intellectual property
rights as corporate assets. Accordingly, we attempt to optimize the value of intellectual property in developing our business strategy
including the selective development, protection, and exploitation of our intellectual property rights. In addition to filings made with
intellectual property authorities, we protect our intellectual property and confidential information by means of carefully considered
processes of communication and the sharing of information, and by the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and provisions
for the same in contractor’s agreements. While no agreement offers absolute protection, such agreements provide some form of recourse
in the event of disclosure, or anticipated disclosure.
Our
intellectual property position, like that of many biomedical companies, is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions
for which important legal principles are unresolved. For more information regarding challenges to our existing or future patents, see
“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November
28, 2022.
Financial Overview
The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Past operating
results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods. The discussion contains forward-looking statements,
which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Forward Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this report.
We are in the development stage and have not earned
any revenues since our inception in 2004. We do not anticipate earning any revenues until we can establish an alliance with other companies
to develop, co-develop, license, acquire or market our products.
Our operating costs consist primarily of research
and development activities including the cost of clinical trials and clinical supplies as well as clinical drug manufacturing and formulation.
Research and development expenses also include personnel related costs such as salaries and wages, and third-party contract research organization
(CRO) expenses in support of these clinical trials. Personnel costs include salaries and wages, benefits, and non-cash stock-based compensation
charges associated with options and other equity awards granted to employees and consultants who are directly engaged in support of our
research and development activities.
General and administrative expenses consist of personnel
costs, expenses for outside professional services and expenses associated with operating as a public company. Personnel costs consist
of salaries and wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for general and administrative personnel. Outside professional services and
public company expenses include expenses related to compliance and reporting, additional insurance expenses, audit and SOX compliance,
expenses associated with patent research, applications and filings, investor and stockholder relations activities and other administrative
expenses and professional services.
Comparison of the three months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for the quarter ended December
31, 2022 were $15.4 million, compared to $11.7 million for the comparable quarter ended December 31, 2021.
14
Our research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31,
2022 were $12.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development
expenses is primarily related to (i) an increase in personnel costs of $0.7 million and an increase in stock based compensation expense
of $1.4 million as a result of the expansion of our team engaged in research and development activities, (ii) an increase of approximately
$0.7 million over the comparable period, relating to the manufacture of additional clinical trial supplies for both our ANAVEX ® 2-73
and ANAVEX ® 3-71 programs and (iii) an increase in costs associated with expanded enrollment in our EXCELLENCE trial.
The following table summarizes our research and development
expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $3.1 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of $0.2 million
mostly relating to an increase in professional and IP related costs.
During the quarter, we utilized cash and cash equivalents
of $5.8 million to fund our operations, compared to $3.5 million during comparable quarter in fiscal 2022. Our cash position was $143.6
million at December 31, 2022 compared to $149.2 million at our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.
We expect to continue an increase in our research
and development expenditures as we advance our ANAVEX ® 2-73 clinical trials, including planned advancement of ANAVEX ® 2-73
for Parkinson’s disease program, planned initiation of a Fragile X clinical program, ongoing extension trials of our current clinical
programs, continued advancement of our other pipeline compounds such as ANAVEX ® 3-71, and as we continue to add additional
staffing to manage and support these clinical initiatives.
Other income (net)
The net amount of other income for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 was $2.4 million as compared to $0.9 million for the comparable three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase
in other income for the quarter is primarily related to an increase in return on excess cash invested in cash equivalents as well as a
foreign exchange gain relating to the recovery of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar during the period.
15
Net loss
Net loss for the current quarter was $13.0 million,
or $0.17 per share, as compared to $10.9 million, or $0.14 per share in the comparative quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in net loss
for the quarter is primarily related to increased research and development fees as discussed above.

At December 31, 2022, we had current assets of $148.4
million, a decrease of $4.3 million from September 30, 2022. The decrease in current assets relates mostly to cash used in operations
of $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, we had current liabilities of
$13.2 million, an increase of $3.0 million from September 30, 2022. A portion of this increase relates to an increase in deferred grant
income of $0.5 million relating to amounts received during the quarter for a research grant awarded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for
Parkinson’s Research. Other increases in current liabilities relate to amounts owed at period end for manufacturing of additional
clinical trial supplies for use in future studies.
We intend to
continue to use our capital resources to advance our clinical trials for ANAVEX ® 2-73 and ANAVEX ® 3-71, and
to perform work necessary to prepare for future development of our pipeline compounds.

Cash flow used in operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 was $5.8 million, compared to $3.5 million during the comparable quarter ended December 31, 2021. The principal
reason for this increase in net cash used in operating activities in the current period is due to the receipt of the Company’s annual
research and development incentive income refund in the comparable quarter.
Cash flow provided by financing activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 was $0.3 million, attributable to the exercise of employee stock options, while
cash
provided by financing activities for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 was
$2.5 million, primarily attributable to the sale of
common shares at various market prices under the Sales Agreement, described below.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
On February 3, 2023 (the “Execution
Date”), the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights
agreement (“RRA”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“LPC”), an Illinois limited liability company,
whereby the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to sell to LPC up to $150,000,000 in shares of the Company’s common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”) from time to time over a 36 month period pursuant to the terms of
the Purchase Agreement.
On any business day and subject to certain customary
conditions, the Company may direct LPC to purchase up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock (such purchases, “ Regular
Purchases ”). The amount of a Regular Purchase may increase under certain circumstances based on the market price of the Common
Stock; provided, however, that LPC’s committed obligation under any Regular Purchase shall not exceed $4,000,000. The purchase price
of shares of Common Stock will be based on the then prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales as described in the Purchase
Agreement. There are no limits on the price per share that LPC may pay to purchase Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement. In addition,
if the Company has directed LPC to purchase the full amount of Common Stock available as a Regular Purchase on a given day, it may direct
LPC to purchase additional amounts as “accelerated purchases” and “additional accelerated purchases” as set forth
in the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement limits the Company’s
sale shares of Common Stock to LPC to 15,606,426 shares of Common Stock, representing 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding
on the date of the Purchase Agreement unless (i) shareholder approval is obtained to issue more than such amount or (ii) the
average price of all applicable sales of Common Stock to LPC under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds the lower of (A) the closing
price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market immediately preceding the Execution Date or (B) the average of the closing price
of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the five Business Days immediately preceding the Execution Date.
The Purchase Agreement also prohibits the Company
from directing LPC to purchase any shares of Common Stock if those shares, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then
beneficially owned by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, would result in LPC and its affiliates having beneficial ownership, at any single
point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then total outstanding shares of Common Stock, as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 13d-3 thereunder.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties, covenants, closing conditions and indemnification and termination provisions by, among and for the benefit of the parties.
LPC has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of the Company’s
Common Stock. The Purchase Agreement does not limit the Company’s ability to raise capital from other sources at its sole discretion;
provided, however, that the Company shall not enter into any “Variable Rate Transaction” as defined in the Purchase Agreement,
including the issuance of any floating conversion rate or variable priced equity-like securities, but excluding any “At-the-Market”
offering with a registered broker-dealer, during the 36 month term of the Purchase Agreement.
In consideration for entering into the Purchase Agreement,
the Company will issue to LPC 75,000 shares of Common Stock as a commitment fee and shall issue up to 75,000 shares pro rata as up to
$150,000,000 of shares of our common stock are purchase by LPC at our discretion from time to time, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time at its discretion without any cost to the Company.
Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to LPC under
the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others,
market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for
the Company and its operations.
The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend
on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its stock to LPC. The Company expects that any proceeds received by
the Company from such sales to LPC will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
