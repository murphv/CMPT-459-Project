Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1:
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
IF Bancorp, Inc., (“IF Bancorp” or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation whose principal activity is the ownership and management of its wholly owned subsidiary, Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (“Iroquois Federal” or the “Association”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Association, and the Association’s wholly owned subsidiary, L.C.I. Service Corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and with instructions for Form 10–Q and Regulation S–X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, the preceding unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations for the three month and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2022. The results of operations for the three month and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
COVID-19
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the
COVID-19
pandemic. Significant progress has been made to combat the outbreak of
COVID-19;
however, the global pandemic has adversely impacted a broad range of industries in which the Company’s customers operate and could still impair their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to the Company. The Company’s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its employees and customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. With the availability and distribution of
COVID-19
vaccines, we anticipate continued improvements in commercial and consumer activity and the U.S. economy. However, if there is a resurgence in the virus, the Company could experience further adverse effects on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, the extent to which is uncertain.
Revenue Recognition
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
7
Table of Contents
The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit and investments securities, as well as revenue related to our mortgage servicing activities and bank owned life insurance, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC 606, and which are presented in our income statements as components of noninterest income are as follows:
•
Customer Service Fees - The Company generates revenue from fees charged for deposit account maintenance, overdrafts, wire transfers, and check fees. The revenue related to deposit fees is recognized at the time the performance obligation is satisfied.
•
Insurance Commissions - The Company’s insurance agency, Iroquois Insurance Agency, receives commissions on premiums of new and renewed business policies. Iroquois Insurance Agency records commission revenue on direct bill policies as the cash is received. For agency bill policies, Iroquois Insurance Agency retains its commission portion of the customer premium payment and remits the balance to the carrier. In both cases, the carrier holds the performance obligation.
•
Brokerage Commissions - The primary brokerage revenue is recorded at the beginning of each quarter through billing to customers based on the account asset size on the last day of the previous quarter. If a withdrawal of funds takes place, a prorated refund may occur; this is reflected within the same quarter as the original billing occurred. All performance obligations are met within the same quarter that the revenue is recorded.
•
Other - The Company generates revenue through service charges from the use of its ATM machines and interchange income from the use of Company issued credit and debit cards. The revenue is recognized at the time the service is used, and the performance obligation is satisfied.
Note 2:
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Organizations will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on
available-for-sale
debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For public companies eligible to be smaller reporting companies (SRC), this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. In preparation for the adoption of ASU
2016-13,
we engaged a firm specializing in ALLL modeling and have been transition modeling for the past couple years. We also had our CECL model validated by an independent firm.
The Company early adopted ASU
2016-13
using the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, effective July 1, 2022. Results for the periods beginning after July 1, 2022 are presented under ASU
2016-13,
while prior period amounts are reported in accordance with the previously applicable accounting standards. The Company recorded a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $ 388 ,000 upon adoption of ASU
2016-13.
The transition adjustment included an increase to the allowance for credit losses on loans of $ 47 ,000 and an increase to the allowance to credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposure of $ 496 ,000. The transition adjustment included a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets.

In March 2022, FASB issued ASU
2022-02,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and  Vintage Disclosures .
The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance and related disclosures for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic
310-40,  Receivables—Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and requiring an entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic
326-20,  Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost . The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years and are applied prospectively, except with respect to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, where an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. An entity may elect to early adopt the amendments regarding TDRs and related disclosure enhancements separately from the amendments related to vintage disclosures. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note 3:
Stock-based Compensation
In connection with the conversion to stock form, the Association established an ESOP for the exclusive benefit of eligible employees (all salaried employees who have completed at least
1,000
hours of service in a
twelve-month
period and have attained the age of
21 ). The ESOP borrowed funds from the Company in an amount sufficient to purchase
384,900
shares (approximately
8 % of the common stock issued in the stock offering). The loan is secured by the shares purchased and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from contributions made by the Association and dividends received by the ESOP. Contributions will be applied to repay interest on the loan first, and then the remainder will be applied to principal. The loan is expected to be repaid over a period of up to
20
years. Shares purchased with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account for allocation among participants as the loan is repaid. Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account are allocated among participants in proportion to their compensation, relative to total
9
Table of Contents
compensation of all active participants. Participants will vest
100 % in their accrued benefits under the employee stock ownership plan after
six
vesting years, with prorated vesting in years
two
through
five . Vesting is accelerated upon retirement, death or disability of the participant or a change in control of the Association. Forfeitures will be reallocated to remaining plan participants. Benefits may be payable upon retirement, death, disability, separation from service, or termination of the ESOP. Since the Association’s annual contributions are discretionary, benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be estimated. Participants receive the shares at the end of employment.
The Company is accounting for its ESOP in accordance with ASC Topic 718,
Employers Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans . Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP is eliminated in consolidation and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated balance sheets. Contributions to the ESOP shall be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. As shares are committed to be released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the average market price of the shares for the respective period, and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Dividends, if any, on unallocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of debt and accrued interest.
A summary of ESOP shares at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
7,440
ESOP shares were paid to ESOP participants due to separation from service and
7,683
shares were transferred out as a result of participant diversification. During the six months ended December 31, 2021,
1,137
ESOP shares were paid to ESOP participants due to separation from service.
The IF Bancorp, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) was approved by stockholders in 2012 for a
ten-year
period which ended in November 2022. The purpose of the Equity Incentive Plan was to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders. The Equity Incentive Plan authorized the issuance or delivery to participants of up to
673,575
shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and
non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was
481,125
and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was
192,450 . This plan was replaced by the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan when the stockholders approved the new plan on November 21, 2022. The new plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to
264,850
shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and
non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was
52,970
and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was
211,888 .
On December 10, 2013,
85,500
shares of restricted stock and
167,000
in stock options were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock vest in equal installments over
10
years and the stock options vest in equal installments over
7
years. Vesting of both the restricted stock and options started in December 2014. On December 10, 2015,
16,900
shares of restricted stock were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock vest in equal installments over
8
years, starting in December 2016. On September 9,
10
Table of Contents
2022,
53,000
shares of restricted stock were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock will vest in equal installments over 5 years, starting in September 2023.
No
shares have been granted from the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2022, so there are
211,888
shares of restricted stock and
52,970
stock option shares available for future grants under this plan.

The fair value of the restricted stock awards is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period and is based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted that are expected to vest. At the date of grant the par value of the shares granted was recorded in equity as a credit to common stock and a debit to
paid-in
capital. Stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefit for restricted stock, which was recognized in
non-interest
expense, was $ 145,000
and $ 41,000 , respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and was $ 80,000
and $ 23,000 , respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Unrecognized compensation expense for
non-vested
restricted stock awards was $ 1,119,000
at December 31, 2022, and is expected to be recognized over
4.7
years with a corresponding credit to
paid-in

Available for sale securities (“AFS”), which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the future, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. All securities have been classified as available for sale.
Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized or accreted as adjustments to income over the estimated life of the security using the level yield method or to the earlier of call or maturity date. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.
For AFS securities with fair value less than amortized cost that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings, while the noncredit loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected based on cash flow projections, and is recorded to the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on investments, by a charge to provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company intends to sell an impaired AFS security, or, if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there would be no ACL in this situation.
At adoption of ASU
2016-13,
no impairment on AFS securities was attributable to credit. The Company will evaluate impaired AFS securities at the individual level on a quarterly basis, and will consider such factors including, but not limited to: the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; the payment structure of the security and likelihood of the issuer to be able to make payments that may increase in the future; failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. A qualitative determination as to whether any portion of the impairment is attributable to credit risk is acceptable. There were no credit related factors underlying unrealized losses on AFS securities at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.
Changes in the ACL are recorded as expense. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
The Company did not hold securities of any one issuer at December 31, 2022 with a book value that exceeded
10 % of the Company’s total equity except for: Mortgage-backed GSE residential securities and Small Business Administration securities with a book value of approximately $ 206,631 ,000 and $ 18,366 ,000, respectively, and a market value of approximately $ 180,078 ,000 and $ 16,176 ,000, respectively, at December 31, 2022.
All mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were issued by GSEs.
The amortized cost and fair value of
available-for-sale
securities at December 31, 2022, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The carrying value of securities pledged as collateral to secure public deposits and for other purposes was $ 110,870,000
and $ 125,209,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
The carrying value of securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to $ 9.9  million at December 31, 2022 and $ 9.2  million at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, all $ 9.9  million of our repurchase agreements had an overnight maturity, and all were secured by U.S. Government, federal agency and GSE securities. The right of offset for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral pledged by the Company would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default. The collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, the Company will pledge additional securities. The Company closely monitors collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained.
Gross gains of $ 0
and $ 0
and gross losses of $ 183 ,000 and $ 0
resulting from sales of
available-for-sale
securities were realized for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Tax credit applicable to these net realized losses was $ 52 ,000 and $ 0 , respectively.
Certain investments in debt securities are reported in the consolidated financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. Total fair value of these investments at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, was $ 197,809 ,000 and $ 209,133 ,000, respectively, which is approximately
95 % and
95 % of the Company’s
available-for-sale
investment portfolio. These declines in fair value at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, resulted from increases in market interest rates and are considered temporary.

The unrealized losses on the Company’s investment in U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government and federal agency, Mortgage-backed Government sponsored enterprises and Small Business Administration securities at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, were mostly the result of a decline in market value that was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and the Company does not consider those investments to be impaired at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

The Company believes that sound loans are a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. Recognizing the Company’s obligations to its depositors and to the communities it serves, authorized personnel are expected to seek to develop and make sound, profitable loans that resources permit and that opportunity affords. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus our lending efforts on the types, locations, and duration of loans most appropriate for our business model and markets. The Company’s lending activity includes the origination of
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans, multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity lines of credit, and to a lesser extent, consumer loans (consisting primarily of automobile loans), construction loans and land loans. The primary lending market includes the Illinois counties of Vermilion, Iroquois, Champaign and Kankakee, as well as the adjacent counties in Illinois and Indiana. The Company also has a loan production and wealth management office in Osage Beach, Missouri, which serves the Missouri counties of Camden, Miller, and Morgan. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate, of the borrowers and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.
Management reviews and approves the Company’s lending policies and procedures on a routine basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews our allowance for credit losses and reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and
non-performing
and potential problem loans. Our underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. The integrity and character of the borrower are significant factors in our loan underwriting. As a part of underwriting, tangible positive or negative evidence of the borrower’s integrity and character are sought out. Additional significant underwriting factors beyond location, duration, the sound and profitable cash flow basis underlying the loan and the borrower’s character are the quality of the borrower’s financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral.
Interest on loans is accrued based upon the principal amount outstanding. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of ACL. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all instances, loans are placed on
non-accrual
or are charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal and interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on
non-accrual
or charged off are reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on a cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
The Company’s policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. The structure of the Company’s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors through its Operating Committee, consisting of the Chairman and up to four other Board members. At no time is a borrower’s total borrowing relationship to exceed our regulatory lending limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and the Company’s directors, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines and the Board of Directors at least annually.
The Company conducts internal loan reviews that validate the loans against the Company’s loan policy quarterly for mortgage, consumer, and small commercial loans on a sample basis, and all larger commercial loans on an annual basis. The Association also receives independent loan reviews performed by a third party on larger commercial loans to be performed annually. In addition to compliance with our policy, the loan review process reviews the risk assessments made by our credit department, lenders and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management, Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
The Company’s lending can be summarized into six primary areas:
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, home equity lines of credits, real estate construction, commercial business loans, and consumer loans.

Table of Contents
One-
to four-family Residential Mortgage Loans
The Company offers
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting standards (conforming loans) as well as
non-conforming
loans. In recent years there has been an increased demand for long-term fixed-rate loans, as market rates have dropped and remained near historic lows. As a result, the Company has sold a substantial portion of the fixed-rate
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of
15
years or greater. Generally, the Company retains fixed-rate
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of less than
15
years, although this has represented a small percentage of the fixed-rate loans originated in recent years due to the favorable long-term rates for borrowers.
The Company also offers USDA (USDA Rural Development) and FHA loans that are originated through a nationwide wholesale lender.
In addition, the Company also offers home equity loans that are secured by a second mortgage on the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Home equity loans are generally underwritten using the same criteria used to underwrite
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans.
As
one-
to four-family residential mortgage and home equity loan underwriting are subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its
one-
to four-family residential mortgage and home equity loans to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt to income ratio and credit history of the borrower.
Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans
Commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily secured by office buildings, owner-occupied businesses, strip mall centers, churches and farm loans secured by real estate. In underwriting commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, the Company considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Personal guarantees are typically obtained from commercial real estate and multi-family real estate borrowers. In addition, the borrower’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. The repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property. However, the commercial real estate loan generally must be supported by an adequate underlying collateral value. The performance and the value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by economic factors or geographical and/or industry specific factors. These loans are subject to other industry guidelines that are closely monitored by the Company.
Home Equity Lines of Credit
In addition to traditional
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, the Company offers home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria used to underwrite
one-
to four-family residential mortgage loans. As home equity lines of credit underwriting is subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its home equity lines of credit to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt to income ratio and credit history of the borrower.
Commercial Business Loans
The Company originates commercial
non-mortgage
business (term) loans and lines of credit. These loans are generally originated to small- and
medium-sized
companies in the Company’s primary market area. Commercial business loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment and inventory, accounts receivable or stock. The Company also offers agriculture loans that are not secured by real estate.
1 7
Table of Contents
The commercial business loan portfolio consists primarily of secured loans. When making commercial business loans, the Company considers the financial statements, lending history and debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of any collateral. The cash flows of the underlying borrower, however, may not perform consistently with historical or projected information. Further, the collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value due to individual economic or other factors. Loans are typically guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. The Company has established minimum standards and underwriting guidelines for all commercial loan types.
Commercial business loans also included Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans which were covered by a
100 % government guaranty. As of December 31, 2022 and June 2022, the Company had
no
PPP loans, compared to
43
PPP loans totaling $ 8.0  million at December 31, 2021.
Real Estate Construction Loans
The Company originates construction loans for
one-
to four-family residential properties and commercial real estate properties, including multi-family properties. The Company generally requires that a commitment for permanent financing be in place prior to closing the construction loan. The repayment of these loans is typically through permanent financing following completion of the construction. Real estate construction loans are inherently more risky than loans on completed properties as the unimproved nature and the financial risks of construction significantly enhance the risks of commercial real estate loans. These loans are closely monitored and subject to other industry guidelines.
Consumer Loans
Consumer loans consist of installment loans to individuals, primarily automotive loans. These loans are underwritten utilizing the borrower’s financial history, including the Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”)
credit scoring and information as to the underlying collateral. Repayment is expected from the cash flow of the borrower. Consumer loans may be underwritten with terms up to seven years, fully amortized. Unsecured loans are limited to twelve months.
Loan-to-value
ratios vary based on the type of collateral. The Company has established minimum standards and underwriting guidelines for all consumer loan collateral types.
Loan Concentration
The loan portfolio includes a concentration of loans secured by commercial real estate properties amounting to $ 322,406,000
and $ 290,972,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Generally, these loans are collateralized by multi-family and nonresidential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or from proceeds from the sale of the properties of the borrower.
Purchased Loans and Loan Participations
The Company’s loans receivable included purchased loans of $ 696,000
and $ 1,570,000
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. All of these purchased loans are secured by single family homes located out of our primary market area, but still primarily in the Midwest. The Company’s loans receivable also include commercial loan participations of $ 38,589,000
and $ 29,972,000
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, of which $ 21,551,000
and $ 13,234,000 , at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were outside our primary market area.

Management’s opinion as to the ultimate collectability of loans is subject to estimates regarding future cash flows from operations and the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of borrowers.
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents the Company’s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by the Company as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, the Company relies on a sound credit review and approval process. The review process is directed by the overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty.
The Company adopted ASU
2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022, and utilizes the CECL cohort methodology analysis which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience.
The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans and is established through provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The ACL is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. Loans are charged off in the period deemed uncollectible, based on management’s analysis of expected cash flows (for
non-collateral
dependent loans) or collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans). Subsequent recoveries of loans previously charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance when received.
Management estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments may be made to historical loss information for differences identified in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards or terms; lending review systems; experience, ability, or depth of lending management and staff; portfolio growth and mix; delinquency levels and trends; as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic activity or employment, industry economic conditions, property values, or other relevant factors.

The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them separately.
The specific allowance for collateral-dependent loans that are evaluated separately is measured by determining the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expense. Factors used in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of the collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, the Company also considers the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
The Company establishes a general allowance for loans that are not deemed collateral-dependent to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. The general valuation allowance is determined by segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks and collecting data to determine pool loss experience. Factors considered by the Company in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and troubled debt restructurings, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period.
Prior to the July 1, 2022, adoption of ASU
2016-13,
the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) represented management’s best estimate of probable losses in the existing loan portfolio at the end of the reporting period. Integral to the methodology for determining the adequacy of the ALLL was portfolio segmentation and impairment measurement. Under the Company’s methodology, loans were first segmented into 1) those comprising large groups of homogeneous loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment and 2) all other loans which are individually evaluated. Those loans in the second category were further segmented utilizing a defined grading system which involves categorizing loans by severity of risk based on conditions that may affect the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt, such as current financial information, collateral valuations, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current trends. Loans were considered impaired if, based on current information and events, it was considered probable that the Company would be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, and was generally based on the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the loan’s collateral. If the loan was not collateral-dependent, the measurement of impairment was based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate, or the observable market price of the loan. Impairment identified through this evaluation process was a component of the ALLL. If a loan was not considered impaired, it was grouped together with loans having similar characteristics (i.e., the same risk grade), and an ALLL was based upon a quantitative factor (historical average charge-offs) and qualitative factors such as certain management assumptions, changes in lending policies; national, regional, and local economic conditions; changes in mix and volume of portfolio; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff; entry to new markets; levels and trends of delinquent, nonaccrual, special mention, and classified loans; concentrations of credit; changes in collateral values; agricultural economic conditions; and regulatory risk.
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. All loans are graded at inception of the loan. Subsequently, analyses are performed on an annual basis and grade changes are made as necessary. Interim grade reviews may take place if circumstances of the borrower warrant a more timely review. The Company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem loans. Under the Company’s risk rating system, the Company classifies problem and potential problem loans as “Watch,” “Substandard,” “Doubtful,” and “Loss.” The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
23
Table of Contents
Pass –
Loans classified as pass are well protected by the ability of the borrower to pay or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral.
Watch –
Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard –
Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of any pledged collateral. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful –
Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loss –
Loans classified as loss are the portion of the loan that is considered uncollectible so that its continuance as an asset is not warranted. The amount of the loss determined will be
charged-off.
Risk characteristics applicable to each segment of the loan portfolio are described as follows.
Residential
One-
to Four-Family and Equity Lines of Credit Real Estate:  The residential
one-
to four-family real estate loans are generally secured by owner-occupied
one-
to four-family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within the Company’s market areas that might impact either property values or a borrower’s personal income. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.
Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate:  Commercial and multi-family real estate loans typically involve larger principal amounts, and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operations of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Credit risk in these loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the Company’s market areas.
Construction Real Estate:  Construction real estate loans are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment of these loans may include permanent loans, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are considered to be higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. Credit risk in these loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the Company’s market areas.
Commercial:  The commercial portfolio includes loans to commercial customers for use in financing working capital needs, equipment purchases and expansions. The loans in this category are repaid primarily from the cash flow of a borrower’s principal business operation. Credit risk in these loans is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations.
24
Table of Contents
Consumer:  The consumer loan portfolio consists of various term loans such as automobile loans and loans for other personal purposes. Repayment for these types of loans will come from a borrower’s income sources that are typically independent of the loan purpose. Credit risk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the Company’s market area) and the creditworthiness of a borrower.
The following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company’s loan portfolio based on risk rating category and year of origination as of December 31, 2022 and the risk rating category and class of loan as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands):

The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all instances, loans are placed on
non-accrual
or are
charged-off
at an earlier date if collection of principal and interest is considered doubtful.
All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on
non-accrual
or
charged-off
are reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on a cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Since the Company adopted ASU
2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022, the allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics, while some collateral-dependent loans are selected to be evaluated individually. At June 30, 2022, four collateral-dependent
one-
to four-family loans were individually evaluated, but none were determined to require a specific reserve.
In accordance with the impairment accounting guidance (ASC
310-10-35-16),
which was in effect for the Company prior to the adoption of ASU
2016-13
on July 1, 2022, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable the Association will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a
case-by-case
basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
Impairment is measured on a
loan-by-loan
basis by either the present value of the expected future cash flows, the loan’s observable market value, or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Significantly restructured loans are considered impaired in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
The Company actively seeks to reduce its investment in impaired loans. The primary tools to work through impaired loans are settlements with the borrowers or guarantors, foreclosure of the underlying collateral, or restructuring.
The following tables present impaired loans as of June 30, 2022 and December, 2021:

At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had a number of loans that were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDR’s). The modification of terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: an extension of maturity, a reduction of the stated interest rate or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan.
The following table presents the recorded balance, at original cost, of troubled debt restructurings, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. All TDRs were performing according to the terms of the restructuring and were accruing as of December 31, 2022 and as of June 2022.

COVID-19
Modifications
Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that was signed into law on March 27, 2020, certain
COVID-19
loan modifications are not designated as TDRs. The CARES Act allows the Company to presume a loan modification is not a TDR if it is (1) related to
COVID-19;
(2) executed on a loan that was not more than
30
days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a)
60
days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (b) December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Economic Aid Act, which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, until the earlier of 60 days after the national emergency termination date or January 1, 2022. In 2020 and 2021, the Company made
COVID-19
modifications to allow our borrowers to pay interest only for up to six months. As of December 31, 2022, all of these loans have returned to principal and interest payments or paid off.
TDR’s with Defaults
The Company had no TDRs in default and
no
restructured loans in foreclosure as of December 31, 2022 or as of June 30, 2022. The Company defines a default as any loan that becomes
90
days or more past due.
Specific loss allowances are included in the calculation of estimated future loss ratios, which are applied to the various loan portfolios for purposes of estimating future losses.
Management considers the level of defaults within the various portfolios, as well as the current economic environment and outlook in the real estate and collateral markets when evaluating qualitative adjustments used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We believe the qualitative adjustments more accurately reflect collateral values in light of the sales and economic conditions that we have recently observed.
We may obtain physical possession of real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan or home equity loan via foreclosure or
in-substance
repossession. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any foreclosed residential real estate properties as a result of obtaining physical possession. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any residential mortgage loans and home equity loans collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process.
Note 7:
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock
Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a required investment for institutions that are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The required investment in the common stock is based on a predetermined formula. The Company owned approximately $ 3,843,000
and $ 3,142,000
of Federal Home Loan Bank stock as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The FHLB provides liquidity and funding through advances.

Note 11:
Regulatory Capital
The Association is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Association’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Association must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Association’s assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance-sheet
items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Association’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.
32
Table of Contents
The Basel III regulatory capital framework (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) adopted by U.S. federal regulatory authorities, among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 Capital” instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) set forth the acceptable scope of deductions/adjustments to the specified capital measures.
In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of
2.5  percent on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity and the buffer applies to all three measurements: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital.
As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $ 10  billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies issued a final rule setting the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at
9 %, effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Association “opted in” to elect the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2022, the Association met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association’s prompt corrective action category.
Note 12:
Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
Level 2
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets
Level 3
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
33

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the period ended December 31, 2022. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.
34
Table of Contents
Available-for-Sale
Securities
Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. There were no Level 1 securities as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. For these investments, the inputs used by the pricing service to determine fair value may include one, or a combination of, observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads,
two-sided
markets, benchmark securities, bid, offers and reference data market research publications and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 2 securities include U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government and federal agency, mortgage-backed securities (GSE—residential), Small Business Administration and state and political subdivisions. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
Mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow models. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.
Level 3 Reconciliation
The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of recurring fair value measurements recognized in the accompanying balance sheet using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs:

In accordance with the Company’s adoption of ASU
2016-01
as of July 1, 2018, the methods utilized to measure the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2022, represent an approximation of exit price; however, an actual exit price may differ.
Note 13:
Commitments
Commitments to Originate Loans
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a
case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate.
Lines of Credit
Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates. Since a portion of the line may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a
case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. Management uses the same credit policies in granting lines of credit as it does for
on-balance-sheet
instruments.

Off-Balance
Sheet Credit Exposures
Off-balance
sheet credit instruments include commitments to make loans, and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance
by the other party to the financial instrument for
off-balance
sheet loan commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. The ACL on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan pool on a quarterly basis under the current CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur and is included in other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company records an ACL on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures, unless the commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable. With the adoption of
ASU-2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022, an allowance for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures was established for $ 496,000 . As of December 31, 2022, the ACL on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures was reduced to $ 434,000 , primarily due to a decrease in covid-related factors.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are not historical facts, but rather are statements based on management’s current expectations regarding its business strategies and their intended results and IF Bancorp, Inc.’s (“the Company”) future performance. Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends” and similar expressions.
Management’s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our actual results include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment, legislative or regulatory changes that may adversely affect our business, changes in accounting policies and practices, changes in competition and demand for financial services, adverse changes in the securities markets and changes in the quality or composition of the Association’s loan or investment portfolios. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of
the COVID-19
outbreak on our business. Government action in response to the
COVID-19
pandemic and its effects on our business and operations, including vaccination mandates and their effects on our workforce, human capital resources and infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under “Item 1A.—Risk Factors”, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the Company’s other filings with the SEC. These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. See
“COVID-19”
below for a discussion of how the
COVID-19
pandemic may affect our future performance. IF Bancorp, Inc. assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as may be required by law.
Overview
On July 7, 2011 we completed our initial public offering of common stock in connection with the Association’s
mutual-to-stock
conversion, selling 4,496,500 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, including 384,900 shares sold to the Association’s employee stock ownership plan, and raising approximately $45.0 million of gross proceeds. In addition, we issued 314,755 shares of our common stock to the Iroquois Federal Foundation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 1,674,479 shares of common stock under stock repurchase plans.
The Company is a savings and loan holding company and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Company’s business activities are limited to oversight of its investment in the Association.
The Association is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and mortgage services to individual and corporate customers within a
100-mile
radius of its locations in Watseka, Danville, Clifton, Hoopeston, Savoy, Champaign, and Bourbonnais, Illinois, and Osage Beach, Missouri. The principal activity of the Association’s wholly-owned subsidiary, L.C.I. Service Corporation, is the sale of property and casualty insurance. The Association is subject to regulation by the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of savings and transaction accounts, certificates of deposit, and Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income consists primarily of customer service fees, brokerage commission income, insurance commission income, net realized gains on loan sales, mortgage banking income, net gain on foreclosed assets and income on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, professional fees, marketing, office supplies, and federal deposit insurance premiums. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.
40
Our net interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities) was 3.10% and 2.96% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.    Net interest income increased to $12.3 million, or $24.6 million on an annualized basis, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $11.3 million, or $22.5 million on an annualized basis, for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Our emphasis on conservative loan underwriting has historically resulted in relatively low levels of
non-performing
assets. Our
non-performing
loans totaled $251,000, or 0.1%, of total loans at December 31, 2022, and $1.2 million, or 0.2%, of total loans at June 30, 2022. Our
non-performing
assets totaled $251,000, or 0.1% of total assets at December 31, 2022, and $1.3 million, or 0.2%, of total assets at June 30, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, the Association was categorized as “well capitalized” under regulatory capital requirements.
Our net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $3.4 million, compared to a net income of $3.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Association. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form
10-Q.
COVID-19
The
COVID-19
pandemic has caused economic and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. While some industries have been impacted more severely than others, all businesses have been impacted to some degree. As it continues to evolve, it is not clear when or how the pandemic-driven contraction will recover. Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act is to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. Many of the CARES Act provisions, as well as other recent legislative and regulatory efforts, are expected to have a material impact on financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, the
COVID-19
pandemic has not had a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Financial position and results of operations
The Company’s current financial position is strong and the fundamental earning capabilities of its currently existing operations is solid. However, the uncertain economic outlook related to the
COVID-19
crisis could lead to increases in our required allowance for credit losses. All processes, procedures and internal controls are expected to continue as defined in existing applicable policies. While the Company does not currently anticipate any material changes or deficiencies to its capital or liquidity sources, uncertainties about the overall effects on the economy could result in more adverse effects than expected.
Capital and liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by
COVID-19,
our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses.
We maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to us, though rates are increasing. If funding costs are elevated for an extended period, it could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
41
Asset valuation
Currently, we do not expect
COVID-19
to affect our ability to account timely for the assets on our balance sheet; however, this could change in future periods. While certain valuation assumptions and judgments will change to account for pandemic-related circumstances such as widening credit spreads, we do not anticipate significant changes in methodology used to determine the fair value of assets measured in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2022 we did not have any impairment with respect to our intangible assets, premises and equipment or other long-lived assets.
Our Business Continuity and Pandemic Response Plan
The Company maintains a Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Plan to ensure the maintenance or recovery of operations, including services to customers, when confronted with adverse events such as natural disasters, technological failures, human error, cybercrime, terrorism, or pandemic outbreak. When the
COVID-19
pandemic declaration was announced, the Disaster Planning/Recovery team activated the Disaster Recovery Plan, including the Pandemic Response Plan, with a focus on maintaining virtually all customer services in the event of a total or partial closure of banking offices and/or staffing shortages. The team implemented protocols for employee safety, reviewed critical business processes, identified staff who could work remotely, and began mobilizing and preparing the equipment that would be required. All offices are now fully open with safety protocols in place.
Lending operations and accommodations to borrowers
We have worked with customers directly affected by the
COVID-19
pandemic. We continue to offer and provide short-term assistance in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As a result of the current economic environment caused by
COVID-19,
we have engaged in more frequent communication with borrowers to better understand their situation and the challenges faced by them, which has allowed us to respond proactively to their needs and issues.
With the passage of the PPP, administered by the SBA, the Company actively participated in assisting our customers with applications for resources through the program. Most PPP loans had a five-year term and earned interest at 1%. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had no PPP loans remaining in our loan portfolio, compared to 43 PPP loans totaling $8.0 million at December 31, 2021.
Retail operations
Throughout the pandemic, we have been operating and serving our customers with uninterrupted access to their account information and the ability to complete banking transactions by utilizing
drive-ups,
Online and Mobile Banking, and ATMs. With the health and safety of our customers and staff in mind, and consistent with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local governments concerning
COVID-19,
all our banking offices are open with safety protocols in place.
Critical Accounting Policies
We define critical accounting policies as those policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is
42
established by factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance which include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and troubled debt restructurings, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period.
The Company adopted ASU
2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022, and utilizes a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Based on our estimate of the level of allowance for credit losses required, we record a provision for credit losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level. The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them separately. The Company also uses the CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of credit. While the allowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-asset asset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures is reported as a liability.
The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for credit losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.
Income Tax Accounting.
The provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Under U.S. GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, our forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carryback years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods, while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Any required valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability, which could adversely affect our future income tax expense.
As noted above, the Company adopted ASU
2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
effective July 1, 2022. There are no other material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in IF Bancorp, Inc.’s Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022
Total assets decreased $33.8 million, or 3.9%, to $823.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $857.6 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $67.4 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $12.8 million decrease in investment securities, partially offset by a $42.3 million increase in net loans receivable. The decrease in assets was due to the expected withdrawal of deposits by one public entity, as discussed below.
Net loans receivable, including loans held for sale, increased by $42.3 million, or 8.2%, to $561.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $518.9 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in net loans receivable during this period was due primarily to a $24.6 million, or 14.7%, increase in commercial real estate loans, an $11.9 million, or 13.5%, increase in multi-family loans, an $18.2 million, or 13.8%, increase in
one-
to four-family loans, and a $505,000, or 5.6%, increase in consumer loans, partially offset by a $61,000, or 0.9%, decrease in home equity lines of credit, an $8.1 million, or 10.0%, decrease in commercial business loans, and a $4.7 million, or 11.3%, decrease in construction loans.
Investment securities, consisting entirely of securities available for sale, decreased $12.8 million, or 5.8%, to $208.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $220.9 million at June 30, 2022. We had no securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
Between June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, accrued interest receivable increased $558,000 to $2.6 million, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock increased $701,000 to $3.8 million, other assets increased $1.5 million to $2.1 million, mortgage servicing rights increased $52,000 to $1.5 million and deferred income taxes increased $1.6 million to $10.8 million, while premises and equipment decreased $209,000 to $9.3 million and foreclosed assets held for sale decreased $120,000 to $0. The increase in accrued interest receivable was primarily the result of increases in both the average balances and yields of securities and loans; the increase in FHLB stock was due to an increased stock requirement due to an increase in FHLB advances; the increase in other assets was due to a receivable for a matured security on the last day of the quarter for which we had not yet received proceeds and a fluctuation in items in process; the increase in mortgage servicing rights was the result of an increased valuation due to rising interest rates; and the increase in deferred income taxes was mostly due to an increase in unrealized losses on the sale of
available-for-sale
securities. The decrease in premises and equipment was the result of ordinary depreciation and the decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale was due to the sale of property.
At December 31, 2022, our investment in bank-owned life insurance was $14.6 million, an increase of $194,000 from $14.4 million at June 30, 2022. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is
non-taxable.
Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses, which resulted in a limit of $22.9 million at December 31, 2022.
Deposits decreased $84.7 million, or 11.3%, to $667.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $752.0 million at June 30, 2022. Certificates of deposit, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, decreased $255,000, or 0.1%, to $246.7 million, while brokered certificates of deposit increased $14.0 million, or 393.7%, to $17.6 million. Noninterest bearing demand accounts decreased $61.4 million, or 58.5%, to $43.6 million, while savings, NOW, and money market accounts decreased $37.1 million, or 9.4%, to $359.5 million. The large decrease in noninterest bearing demand accounts was due primarily to approximately $57.6 million in deposits from a public entity that collects real estate taxes that was on deposit at June 30, 2022 and withdrawn in the six months ended December 31, 2022, when tax monies were distributed. Repurchase agreements increased $694,000, or 7.5%, to $9.9 million at December 31, 2022, from $9.2 million at June 30, 2022. Borrowings consisted of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago which increased $51.0 million to $66.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $15.0 million at June 30, 2022.
Advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance increased $596,000, or 118.5%, to $1.1 million at December 31, 2022, from $503,000 at June 30, 2022, accrued interest payable increased $499,000, or 283.5%, to $675,000 at December 31, 2022, from $176,000 at June 30, 2022, and the allowance for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures increased $434,000 to $434,000 at December 31, 2022 from $0 at June 30, 2022, while other liabilities decreased $1.8 million, or 28.7%, to $4.5 million at December 31, 2022 from $6.3 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in advances from
44
borrowers for taxes and insurance was attributable to the timing of the payment of real estate taxes and insurance, while the increase in accrued interest payable was mostly due to an increases in both the average balance and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures was the result of the adoption of ASU
2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022. The decrease in other liabilities was a result of accrued compensation and benefits that were paid out in the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Total equity decreased $568,000, or 0.8%, to $71.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $71.7 million at June 30, 2022. Equity decreased primarily due to a decrease of $3.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, a decrease of $388,000 due to the adoption of ASU
2016-13
effective July 1, 2022, and the accrual of approximately $633,000 in dividends to our shareholders. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was primarily due to unrealized depreciation on
available-for-sale
securities, net of tax. These decrease were partially offset by net income of $3.4 million, and ESOP and stock equity plan activity of $776,000.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General.
Net income decreased $222,000 to $3.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $3.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.
Net Interest Income.
Net interest income increased $1.0 million, or 9.3%, to $12.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $11.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This was a result of an increase of $2.6 million in interest and dividend income, partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million in interest expense. Our interest rate spread increased by 14 basis points to 3.10% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.96% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and our net interest margin increased by 17 basis points to 3.20% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.03% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. A $27.3 million, or 3.7%, increase in the average balance of interest earning assets was offset by a $53.0 million, or 8.5%, increase in average balance of interest bearing liabilities.
Interest and Dividend Income.
Interest and dividend income increased $2.6 million, or 20.9%, to $15.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $12.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to a $1.8 million increase in interest income on loans, a $698,000 increase in interest income on securities, and a $115,000 increase in other interest income. The increase in interest income on loans resulted from a 38 basis point, or 9.3%, increase in the average yield on loans to 4.45% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 4.07% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and by a $38.6 million, or 7.6%, increase in the average balance of loans to $548.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $509.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income on securities was due to a $13.6 million, or 6.9%, increase in the average balance of securities to $210.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $196.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and by a 53 basis point increase in the average yield on securities to 2.63% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 2.10% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other interest income was a result of a 350 basis point increase in the average yield in other interest earning assets, including Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and deposits with other financial institutions, to 4.13% from 0.63%, partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in the average balance of other interest earning assets.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $1.6 million, or 121.2%, to $2.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $1.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $985,000 in interest on deposits and a $636,000 increase in interest on borrowings and repurchase agreements.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $985,000, or 91.7%, to $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to a 31 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to 0.67% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 0.36% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and by an increase of $25.7 million in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $615.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $589.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.

Interest expense on borrowings, including FHLB advances and a line of credit from CIBC Bank USA, and repurchase agreements, increased $598,000, or 257.8%, to $830,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $232,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings and repurchase agreements to $62.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $34.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and by a 134 bp increase in the average cost of such borrowings to 2.68% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 1.34% for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Provision (Credit) for Credit Losses.
We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We recorded a provision for credit losses on loans for $75,000 and a credit for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures of $(62,000) for a total provision for credit losses of $13,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a credit for credit losses on loans of $(203,000) for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses was $7.2 million, or 1.26% of total loans, at December 31, 2022, compared to $6.4 million, or 1.28% of total loans, or 1.30% of total loans excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2021, and $7.1 million, or 1.34% of total loans, at June 30, 2022, at which date we had no PPP loans. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net charge-offs of $8,000 were recorded, while during the six months ended December 31, 2021, net charge-offs of $1,000 were recorded.

Noninterest Income .
Noninterest income decreased $899,000, or 30.1%, to $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $3.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of loans, an increase in net realized loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities, a decrease in brokerage commissions, and a decrease in bank-owned life insurance income. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, gain on sale of loans decreased $306,000 to $76,000, net realized loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities increased $(183,000) to $(183,000), brokerage commissions decreased $137,000 to $439,000, and bank-owned life insurance income decreased $111,000 to $194,000, from the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gain on sale of loans was a result of a decrease in loans originated and sold through the FHLBC Mortgage Partnership Finance program in the six months ended December 31, 2022, and the increase in loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities was the result of securities sold at a loss in the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in brokerage commissions was the result of a decrease in the amount of renewal commissions and management fees, while the decrease in bank-owned life insurance income was due to the receipt of death benefit proceeds in the six months ended December 31, 2021.
46
Noninterest Expense .
Noninterest expense increased $217,000, or 2.3%, to $9.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $9.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The largest components of this increase were equipment expense, which increased $164,000, or 16.4%, advertising, which increased $87,000, or 47.5% and professional services, which increased $61,000, or 26.6%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses, which decreased $133,000, or 14.1%. Equipment expense increased as a result of an increase in the cost of core processing, advertising increased due to a new ad campaign in the six months ended December 31, 2022, and professional services increased as a result of additional services received during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Other expenses decreased as a result of a decrease in appraisal and other loan expenses.
Income Tax Expense .
We recorded a provision for income tax of $1.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision for income tax of $1.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting effective tax rates of 26.7% and 26.4%, respectively.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General.
Net income decreased $300,000 to $1.4 million net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.7 million net income for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.
Net Interest Income.
Net interest income increased $366,000 to $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was a result of a $1.8 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in interest expense. Our interest rate spread increased 2 basis points to 3.00% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.98% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and our net interest margin increased by 9 basis points to 3.13% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.04% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. A $25.2 million, or 3.4%, increase in the average balance of interest earning assets was offset by a $60.5 million, or 9.6% increase in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest and Dividend Income.
Interest and dividend income increased $1.8 million, or 28.5%, to $8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $6.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in interest income on loans and a $249,000 increase in interest income on securities. The increase in interest on loans resulted from a 65 basis point, or 15.8%, increase in the average yield on loans to 4.73% from 4.08%, and a $58.3 million, or 11.7%, increase in the average balance of loans to $558.5 million from $500.2 million. The increase in interest income on securities resulted from a 50 basis point, or 22.2%, increase in the average yield on securities to 2.74% from 2.24%, partially offset by a $700,000, or 0.3%, decrease in the average balance of securities to $204.0 million from $204.7 million.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 228.7%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $627,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to an 80 basis point, or 199.9%, increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.20% from 0.40%, and a $60.5 million, or 9.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $689.4 million from $628.9 million.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $932,000, or 182.4%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $511,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.94% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 0.34% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and a $21.9 million, or 3.7%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $615.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $594.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest expense on borrowings increased $502,000, or 432.8%, to $618,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $116,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings to $73.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $35.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and a 203 basis point increase in the average cost of such borrowings to 3.36% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 1.33% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
47
Provision (Credit) for Credit Losses.
We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We recorded a provision for credit losses on loans for $142,000 and a credit for credit losses on
off-balance
sheet credit exposures $(41,000) for a total provision for credit losses of $101,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a credit for credit losses on loans of $(76,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, net recoveries of $1,000 were recorded, while during the three months ended December 31, 2021, net charge-offs of $1,000 were recorded.
Noninterest Income.
Noninterest income decreased $572,000, or 39.7%, to $868,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of loans, a decrease in mortgage banking income, net, an increase in net realized loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities, and a decrease in brokerage commissions. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the net gain on the sale of loans decreased $122,000 to $34,000, mortgage banking income, net, decreased $95,000 to $47,000, net realized loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities increased $(183,000) to $(183,000), and brokerage commissions decreased $87,000 to $201,000, from the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gain on sale of loans and the decrease in mortgage banking income, net, were a result of a decrease in loans originated and sold through the FHLBC Mortgage Partnership Finance program in the three months ended December 31, 2022, and the increase in loss on sale of
available-for-sale
securities was the result of securities sold at a loss in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in brokerage commissions was the result of a decrease in the amount of renewal commissions and management fees in the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Noninterest Expense.
Noninterest expense increased $60,000, or 1.2%, and was $4.9 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The largest components of this increase were equipment expense, which increased $114,000, or 23.7%, and advertising expense, which increased $74,000, or 77.9%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits, which decreased $103,000, or 3.2%. Equipment expense increased as a result of an increase in the cost of core processing, while advertising increased due to a new ad campaign in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Compensation and benefits decreased due to a decrease in annual incentive plan expenses.
Income Tax Expense .
We recorded a provision for income tax of $486,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision for income tax of $629,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting effective tax rates of 25.7% and 27.0%, respectively.
Asset Quality
At December 31, 2022, our
non-accrual
loans totaled $129,000 in
one-
to four-family loans. At December 31, 2022, we had a single
one-
to four-family loans for $62,000 and one commercial business loan for $60,000, which were delinquent 90 days or greater and still accruing interest.
At December 31, 2022, loans classified as substandard equaled $8.1 million. Loans classified as substandard consisted of $527,000 in
one-
to four-family loans, $249,000 in multi-family loans, $2.9 million in commercial real estate loans, $4.4 million in commercial business loans and $8,000 in consumer loans. At December 31, 2022, no loans were classified as doubtful or loss.
At December 31, 2022, watch rated assets consisted of $343,000 in
one-to
four-family loans and $30,000 in commercial business loans.
Troubled Debt Restructuring.
Troubled debt restructurings include loans for which economic concessions have been granted to borrowers with financial difficulties. We periodically modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had $236,000 and $998,000, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2022 our troubled debt restructurings consisted of $206,000 in
one-
to four-family loans and $30,000 in commercial business loans.
48
Foreclosed Assets.
At December 31 2022, we had no foreclosed assets compared to $120,000 as of June 30, 2022. Foreclosed assets at June 30, 2022 consisted of $120,000 in residential real estate properties.
Allowance for Credit Loss Activity
The Company regularly reviews its allowance for credit losses and makes adjustments to its balance based on management’s analysis of the loan portfolio, the amount of
non-performing
and classified loans, as well as general economic conditions. Although the Company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for credit losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the establishment of additional loss provisions. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses over the
six-month
periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

The allowance for credit losses has been calculated based upon an evaluation of pertinent factors underlying the various types and quality of the Company’s loans. Management considers such factors as the repayment status of a loan, the estimated net fair value of the underlying collateral, the borrower’s intent and ability to repay the loan, local economic conditions, and the Company’s historical loss ratios. We maintain the allowance for credit losses through the provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for credit losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. The allowance for credit losses increased $114,000 to $7.2 million at December 31, 2022, from $7.1 million at June 30, 2022. With the adoption of ASU
2016-13,
effective July 1, 2022, a transition adjustment increased the allowance for credit losses on loans by $47,000. This increase in allowance was primarily the result of an increase in our loan portfolio and was necessary in order to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level that reflects management’s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loans.
49
Within each pool, risk elements are evaluated that have specific impacts to the borrowers within the pool. These, along with the general risks and events, and the specific lending policies and procedures by loan type, are analyzed to estimate the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss rates. Factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and troubled debt restructurings, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, increased operating costs for businesses, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumer’s ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve, and management has included a qualitative factor within the ACL. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period.
While management believes that our asset quality remains strong, it recognizes that, due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and the potential changes in market conditions, our level of nonperforming assets and resulting charges-offs may fluctuate. Higher levels of net charge-offs requiring additional provisions for credit losses could result. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan sales and repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, and maturities of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers, as well as unanticipated contingencies. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30, 2022, our liquidity ratio averaged 30.2% and 31.2% of our total assets, respectively. We believe that we had enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2022.
We regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) expected deposit flows; (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and medium-term securities.
Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are affected by our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4  million. Interest-earning time deposits which can offer additional sources of liquidity, totaled $1.3 million at December 31, 2022.
Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included in our financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities were $551,000 and $3.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by net cash provided by principal collections on loans, and proceeds from maturing securities, the sale of securities and
50
pay-downs
on mortgage-backed securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $(35.3) million and $(7.9) million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts and FHLB Advances. The net cash used in financing activities was $(32.6) million and $(24.9) million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company must also maintain adequate levels of liquidity to ensure the availability of funds to satisfy loan commitments. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments principally through the use of current liquid assets and through its borrowing capacity discussed above. The following table summarizes these commitments at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022 totaled $163.8 million, or 24.5% of total deposits. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits, our line of credit or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before December 31, 2023. Moreover, it is our intention as we continue to grow our commercial real estate portfolio, to emphasize lower cost deposit relationships with these commercial loan customers and thereby replace the higher cost certificates with lower cost deposits. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements, which provide an additional source of funds, exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Discount Window, and CIBC Bank USA. Federal Home Loan Bank advances were $66.0 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022 we had the ability to borrow up to an additional $85.2 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, we had $5.0 million available on our CIBC Bank line of credit, and also had the ability to borrow $25.5 million from the Federal Reserve based on current collateral pledged.
The Association is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Association’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Association must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Association’s assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance-sheet
items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Association’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.
The Basel III regulatory capital framework (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) adopted by U.S. federal regulatory authorities, among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 Capital” instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) set forth the acceptable scope of deductions/adjustments to the specified capital measures.
In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5 percent on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity and the buffer applies to all three measurements: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital.
51
As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies issued a final rule setting the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%, effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Association “opted in” to elect the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2022, the Association was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association’s prompt corrective action category. The Association’s Community Bank Leverage Ratio is presented in the table below.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.

13a-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2022.
