​ Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (1)    Organization and Consolidation Deere & Company has been developing innovative solutions to help its customers become more profitable for more than 185 years. References to Deere & Company, John Deere, Deere, or the Company include its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs). The Company is managed through the following operating segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services (FS). References to “equipment operations” include production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry, while references to “agriculture and turf” include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year with quarters ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period. The first quarter ends for fiscal year 2023 and 2022 were January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. Both periods contained
13
weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, or months refer to the Company’s fiscal years generally ending in October and the associated periods in those fiscal years. ​ ​ (2)    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards Quarterly Financial Statements T he interim consolidated financial statements of Deere & Company have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations. All normal recurring adjustments have been included. Management believes the disclosures are adequate to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented. It is suggested these interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the fiscal year. Use of Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
New Accounting Standards The Company closely monitors all Accounting Standard Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other authoritative guidance. ASUs adopted in 2023 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. ASUs to be adopted in future periods are being evaluated and at this point are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. ​ ​ 7

million, $ 1,423
million, and $ 1,348
million at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022, respectively. The contract liability is reduced as the revenue is recognized. During the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, $ 215
million and $ 265
million, respectively, of revenue was recognized from deferred revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of the respective fiscal year. The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $ 1,282  million at January 29, 2023. The estimated revenue to be recognized by fiscal year in millions of dollars follows: remainder of
2023
- $ 278 ,
2024
- $ 332 ,
2025
- $ 260 ,
2026
- $ 168 ,
2027
- $ 100 ,
2028
- $ 61 , and
later years  - $ 83 . As permitted, the Company elected only to disclose remaining performance obligations with an original contract duration greater than one year. The contracts with an expected duration of one year or less are for sales of equipment, service parts, repair services, and certain telematics services.

​ ​   (8)    Financing Receivables The Company monitors the credit quality of financing receivables based on delinquency status. Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts
30 days
or more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing receivables represent receivables for which the Company has ceased accruing finance income. The Company ceases accruing finance income when these receivables are generally
90 days
delinquent. Generally, when receivables are
120 days
delinquent the estimated uncollectible amount from the customer is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.

​ ​ In the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined that the financial services business in Russia met the held for sale criteria. The financing receivables in Russia were reclassified to “Other assets” and the associated allowance for credit losses was reversed (see Note 20). Excluding the portfolio in Russia, the allowance for credit losses decreased during the first quarter of 2023, as the financing receivables continue to benefit from strong fundamentals within the agricultural market. (9)    Securitization of Financing Receivables As a part of its overall funding strategy, the Company periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into VIEs that are special purpose entities (SPEs), or non-VIE banking operations, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes does not meet the accounting criteria for sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the Company’s consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIEs is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions. 15

These notes are presented in the table above with fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps. All outstanding notes and debentures are senior unsecured borrowings and rank equally with each other. ​ (15)    Leases - Lessor The Company leases equipment manufactured or sold by the Company and a limited amount of non-John Deere equipment to retail customers through sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases. Sales-type and direct financing leases are reported in Financing receivables – net on the consolidated balance sheets, while operating leases are reported in Equipment on operating leases – net.

​ ​   (16)    Commitments and Contingencies The Company determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is determined by a review of
five-year
claims costs and current quality developments. The premiums for extended warranties are recognized in Other income in the statements of consolidated income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period.
The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table totaled $ 901
million and $ 781
million at January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows:   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended    ​ ​ January 29

​ ​ At January 29, 2023, the Company had $ 235
million of guarantees issued to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The Company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At January 29, 2023, the accrued losses under these agreements were not material. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at January 29, 2023 was about
seven years . At January 29, 2023, the Company had commitments of $ 467
million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. Also, at January 29, 2023, the Company had restricted assets of $ 269  million, classified as “Other assets.” The Company also had other miscellaneous contingent liabilities and guarantees totaling approximately $ 90
million at January 29, 2023. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at January 29, 2023. 19
​ The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters. The Company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements . (17)    Fair Value Measurements The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values were as follows in millions of dollars. Long-term borrowings exclude finance lease liabilities. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ January 29, 2023 ​ October 30, 2022 ​ January 30, 2022   ​ ​ Carrying Value ​ Fair Value ​ Carrying Value ​ Fair Value ​ Carrying Value ​ Fair Value   Financing receivables – net ​ $ 36,882

​ Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables and Level 2 for all borrowings. Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the Company for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts. Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in millions of dollars follow, excluding the Company’s cash equivalents, which were carried at cost that approximates fair value and consisted of money market funds and time deposits.

15 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The following is a description of the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value: Marketable securities
–
The portfolio of investments is valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are valued using closing prices in the active market in which the investment trades. Derivatives
–
The Company’s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards, and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps). The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies. Financing receivables
–
Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inventories – The impairment was based on net realizable value. Property and equipment - net – The valuations were based on cost and market approaches. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. (18)    Derivative Instruments The Company’s policy is to execute derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The Company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition, the Company has interest rate and foreign currency exposure at certain equipment operations units for sales incentive programs. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. The cash flows from the derivative contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statements of consolidated cash flows. Each derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. All designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at
21
​ inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Cash Flow Hedges Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022 were $ 1,950  million, $ 1,950
million, and $ 2,700
million, respectively. Fair value gains or losses on cash flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transactions impact earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate changes on the related borrowings.
The amount of gain recorded in OCI at January 29, 2023 that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense in the next twelve months if interest rates remain unchanged is $ 38
million after-tax.
No
gains or losses were reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur. Fair Value Hedges Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022 were $ 10,802  million, $ 10,112
million, and $ 8,307
million, respectively. The fair value gains or losses on these contracts were generally offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) with both items recorded in interest expense.
The amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet related to borrowings designated in fair value hedging relationships were as follows in millions of dollars.

​ ​ Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards, and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures for certain borrowings, purchases or sales of inventory, and sales incentive programs. The total notional amounts of these interest rate swaps at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022 were $ 11,147
million, $ 10,568
million, and $ 10,210
million, the foreign exchange contracts were $ 9,304
million, $ 8,185
million, and $ 7,864
million, and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $ 234
million, $ 260
million, and $ 303
million, respectively. The fair value gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recorded in the statements of consolidated income, generally offsetting over time the exposure on the hedged item.

​ Counterparty Risk and Collateral Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination. Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require the Company to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022 was $ 781  million, $ 1,113
million, and $ 213
million, respectively. In accordance with the limits established in these agreements, the Company posted $ 349
million, $ 701
million, and $ 18
million of cash collateral at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company paid $ 8  million of collateral that was outstanding at January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022 to participate in an international futures market to hedge currency exposure, not included in the table below.

161
thousand shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 438.44
per share and a binomial
lattice model
fair value of $ 136.46
per share at the grant date. At January 29, 2023, options for
2.0  million shares were outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $ 178.86
per share. The Company also granted
112
thousand of service-based restricted stock units and
41
thousand of performance/service-based restricted stock units to employees in the first three months of 2023. The weighted-average fair value of the service-based restricted stock units at the grant date was $ 434.02
per unit based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service-based restricted stock units at the grant date was $ 424.93
per unit based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. At January 29, 2023, the Company was authorized to grant awards for an additional
16.6
million shares under the equity incentive plans. ​ (20)   S pecial Items
In the first quarter of 2022, Net sales from the Company’s Russian operations represented
2
percent of Deere’s consolidated Net sales. Sales in the region were impacted as the Company suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia beginning in February 2022. As of January 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, the Company’s net exposure in Russia / Ukraine was approximately $ 229
million and $ 266
million, respectively.

​ In January 2023, the Company reached an agreement to sell its financial services business in Russia (registered in Russia as a leasing company). The completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of 2023. The assets and liabilities were classified as “Other assets” and “Accounts payable and accrued expenses”, respectively, which include $ 100
million of
restricted cash . In the first quarter of 2023, the Company reversed the allowance for credit losses and recorded a valuation allowance on the assets held for sale in “Selling, administrative and general expenses.” The Company does not expect a significant gain or loss upon disposition. On November 17, 2021, employees represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) approved a new collective bargaining agreement. The agreement, which has a term of
six years , covers the wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for the Company’s UAW-represented employees at
14
U.S. facilities. The labor agreement included a lump sum ratification bonus payment of $ 8,500
per eligible employee, totaling $ 90
million, and an immediate wage increase of
10
percent plus further wage increases over the term of the contract. The lump sum payment was expensed in the first quarter of 2022.

million of secured borrowings. The second transaction will result in $ 983
million of secured borrowings and is expected to settle in March 2023. On February 22, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 1.25
per share payable on May 8, 2023, to stockholders of record on March 31, 2023. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 25
​ Item 2.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Organization The Company generates net sales from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The Company manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction, roadbuilding, and forestry. These operations (collectively known as the “equipment operations”) are managed through the production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry operating segments. The Company’s financial services segment provides credit services, which finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties. Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions The Company’s Smart Industrial operating model is focused on making significant investments, strengthening the Company’s capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. These technologies are intended to increase worksite efficiency, improve yields, lower input costs, and ease labor constraints. The Company’s Leap Ambitions are goals designed to boost economic value and sustainability for the Company’s customers. The Company anticipates opportunities in this area, as the Company and its customers have a vested interest in sustainable practices. In February 2023, the Company released its 2022 Sustainability Report, available at JohnDeere.com/sustainability. This report identifies important progress on the Company’s Leap Ambitions in fiscal year 2022. The information in our 2022 Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form a part of, this Form 10-Q. Trends and Economic Conditions Industry Trends for Fiscal Year 2023
– Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2023 are forecasted to increase 5 to 10 percent compared to 2022. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be down about 5 percent in 2023. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in 2023. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat.
Company Trends
– Customers’ demand for integration of technology into equipment is a market trend underlying the Company’s Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions framework. Customers have sought to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. The Company’s approach to technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. This technology is incorporated into products within each of the Company’s operating segments.
Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in the John Deere portfolio of “smart” machines, systems, and solutions. The Company expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future.
Demand for the Company’s equipment remains strong, as order books are full through a majority of 2023. Agricultural fundamentals are expected to remain solid into 2023, and retail demand will comprise most of 2023 sales. The North American retail customer fleet age of combines and large tractors remains above average, and dealer inventories are historically low due to the manufacturing and supply chain constraints over the past few years. The Company expects the replenishment of dealer stock inventory to occur in 2024. Crop prices remain favorable to our customers in part due to low stock-to-use ratios for key grains. The Company expects to sell more large agricultural equipment in 2023 than 2022 in North America, Europe, and South America. Demand for small agricultural equipment remains stable, while turf and utility equipment product sales are expected to be lower due to the overall U.S. economic conditions. Construction equipment markets are forecasted to be steady. Rental fleets replenishment, the energy industry, and U.S. infrastructure spend are expected to offset moderation in residential
26
​ home construction. Roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe and parts of Asia. Net income for the Company’s financial services operations is expected to be lower than fiscal year 2022 due to less-favorable financing spreads as a result of heightened interest rates, higher selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower gains on operating-lease dispositions, partially offset by higher average portfolio balances.
Additional Trends
– The Company experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures in 2022. These trends continued into 2023. While these are two distinct issues and discussed separately below, their impact may be intertwined.
Supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of the business, including parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels. Past due deliveries from suppliers were at elevated levels during 2022. Although past due deliveries remain elevated, the Company experienced improvement during the first quarter of 2023. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to higher levels of production. The Company implemented the following mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand: • Worked with the supply base to obtain allocations and improve on-time deliveries of parts.
• Multi-sourced some parts and materials.
• Provided resources to suppliers to address constraints.
• Entered into long-term contracts for some critical components.
• Utilized alternative freight carriers to expedite delivery. While supply chain disruptions are expected to persist into 2023, the Company is working diligently to secure the parts and components that customers need to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably. Although the Company experienced some improvement in this area during the first quarter of 2023, concerns remain and this issue could impact our ability to meet customer demand in the remainder of 2023. Inflation has continued to be a pervasive feature in 2023, increasing the cost of purchased components, energy, salaries, and wages. Higher costs due to general business inflation were offset by price realization, which mitigated the impact of inflation on the Company’s operating results. The Company expects inflation to continue in 2023 resulting in higher costs. If customers are unwilling to accept increases in cost of John Deere products, or the Company is otherwise unable to offset increases in production costs, inflation could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition. Central bank policy interest rates increased in the first quarter of 2023 and are projected to continue to increase during 2023 but at a moderating pace compared to 2022. Most retail receivables are fixed rate, while wholesale financing receivables are floating rate. The Company has both fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Company manages the risk of interest rate fluctuations by balancing the types and amounts of its funding sources to its financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios. Accordingly, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. Historically, rising interest rates impact the Company’s borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios. As a result, the Company’s financial services operations experienced $53 million (after-tax) of less favorable financing spreads in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The Company expects spread compression to persist during 2023. Supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and rising interest rates are driven by factors outside of the Company’s control, and as a result, the Company cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside. Items of Concern and Uncertainties
– Other items of concern include global and regional political conditions, economic and trade policies, imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, post-pandemic effects, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and volatility in the prices of many commodities. These items could impact the Company’s results. The Company is making investments in technology and in strengthening its capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. As with most technology investments, marketplace adoption and monetization of these features holds an elevated level of uncertainty. ​ 27

​ ​ 250 ​ +115 ​ The cost of sales ratio decreased due to price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Inefficiencies due to the delayed ratification of the UAW labor agreement and contract-ratification bonus costs affected the prior period cost of sales ratio (see Note 20). Research and development expenses were higher due to continued focus on developing and incorporating technology solutions. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased mostly due to higher employee pay driven by inflationary conditions and profit-sharing incentives. The provision for income taxes was higher as a result of higher pretax income. ​ 28
​ Business Segment Results For the equipment operations, higher production costs were mostly due to elevated cost of purchased components, energy, salaries, and wages. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended ​ Production and Precision Agriculture ​ January 29

Net income for the quarter decreased mainly due to less favorable financing spreads as a result of heightened interest rates, higher selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower gains on operating lease dispositions, partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances. Critical Accounting Estimates See the Company’s critical accounting estimates discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these policies. 31
​ CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics and Balance Sheet Data The Company has access to most global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity for the Company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets), and bank lines of credit. The Company closely monitors its liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). The Company operates in multiple industries, which have different funding requirements. The production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry segments are capital intensive and are typically subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. However, the patterns of seasonality in inventory have been affected by increases in production rates and supply chain disruptions experienced during fiscal year 2022, which continue to impact inventory levels during 2023. The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Key metrics are provided in the following table, in millions of dollars: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ January 29

The Company forecasts higher operating cash flows in 2023 driven by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and a favorable change in working capital. There have been no material changes to the contractual and other cash requirements identified in the Company’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This resulted mainly from a working capital change, partially offset by net income adjusted for non-cash provisions. Cash inflows from investing activities were $760 million in the first three months of this year. The primary drivers were collections of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) exceeding the cost of receivables acquired and a change in collateral on derivatives – net, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment. Cash outflows from financing activities were $339 million in the first three months of 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by $763 million during the first three months of this year. Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable
– Trade accounts and notes receivable arise from sales of goods to customers. Trade receivables increased by $1,199 million during the first three months of 2023, mostly due to a seasonal increase. These receivables increased $2,754 million, compared to a year ago, due to higher shipment volumes. The
32
​ percentage of total worldwide trade receivables outstanding for periods exceeding 12 months was 1 percent at each of January 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and January 30, 2022. Financing Receivables and Equipment on Operating Leases
– Financing receivables and equipment on operating leases consist of retail notes originated in connection with financing of new and used equipment, operating leases, revolving charge accounts, sales-type and direct financing leases, and wholesale notes. Financing receivables and equipment on operating leases decreased by $720 million during the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to seasonal payments, and increased by $5,142 million in the past 12 months, due to strong retail sales. Total acquisition volumes of financing receivables and equipment on operating leases were 31 percent higher in the first three months of 2023, compared with the same period last year, as volumes of wholesale notes, operating leases, retail notes, and revolving charge accounts were higher, while finance leases were lower compared to January 30, 2022. Inventories
– Inventories increased by $1,561 million during the first three months, primarily due to a seasonal increase. Inventories increased $2,121 million, compared to a year ago, due to higher forecasted shipment volumes and supply chain disruptions, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. A majority of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
Property and Equipment
– Property and equipment cash expenditures in the first three months of 2023 were $315 million, compared with $193 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures in 2023 are estimated to be approximately $1,400 million. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
– Decreased by $1,714 million in the first three months of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses associated with dealer sales discounts, employee benefits, and derivative liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2,457 million compared to a year ago, due to an increase in accrued expenses associated with derivative liabilities, accrued taxes, and employee benefits, and an increase in accounts payable associated with trade payables. Borrowings
– Total external borrowings increased by $2,165 million in the first three months of 2023 and increased $6,754 million compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and the lease portfolio, as well as other working capital requirements. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, has a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 9). The facility was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration in November 2023 and increased the total capacity or “financing limit” from $1,000 million to $1,500 million. At January 29, 2023, $786 million of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. In the first three months of 2023, the financial services operations retired $849 million of retail note securitization borrowings, which are presented in “Increase (decrease) in total short-term borrowings.”
Lines of Credit
– The Company also has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,327 million at January 29, 2023, $1,581 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at January 29, 2023 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $3,000 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2026, and $2,500 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2027. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation and other parts of the Company to maintain certain performance metrics and liquidity targets. The Company expects to extend the terms of these credit facilities. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the financial statements. Debt Ratings
– To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company’s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold Company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of the Company’s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and
33
​ outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Senior      ​      ​   ​ ​ Long-Term ​ Short-Term ​ Outlook   Fitch Ratings ​ A+ ​ F1 ​ Stable ​ Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.   A2   Prime-1   Positive ​ Standard & Poor’s   A   A-1   Stable ​ ​ Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained herein, including in the section entitled “Overview” relating to future events, expectations, and trends constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve factors that are subject to change, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect all lines of the Company’s operations generally while others could more heavily affect a particular line of business. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events and should not be relied upon.
Except as required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to:
​ ● changes in U.S. and international laws, regulations, and policies relating to trade, spending, taxing, banking, monetary, environmental (including climate change and engine emission), and farming policies;
● political, economic, and social instability of the geographies in which the Company operates;
● wars and other conflicts, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and natural disasters; ● adverse macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment, inflation, rising interest rates, changes in consumer practices due to slower economic growth or possible recession, and liquidity constraints; ● growth and sustainability of non-food uses for crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production); ● the Company’s ability to execute business strategies, including the Company’s Smart Industrial operating model, Leap Ambitions, and mergers and acquisitions; ● the ability to understand and meet its customers’ changing expectations and demand for John Deere products; ● accurately forecasting customer demand for products and services and adequately managing inventory; ● changes to governmental communications channels (radio frequency technology); ● gaps or limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity, and speed needed to support technology solutions; ● the Company’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets; ● dealer practices and their ability to manage distribution of John Deere products and support and service precision technology solutions; ● changes in climate patterns and unfavorable weather events;
● higher interest rates and currency fluctuations which could adversely affect the U.S. dollar, customer confidence, access to capital, and demand for our products; ● changes in the Company’s credit ratings, and failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding; ● availability and price of raw materials, components, and whole goods; ● delays or disruptions in the Company’s supply chain; ● labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions; ● the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel; ● security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the Company and its products;
● loss of or challenges to intellectual property rights; ● compliance with evolving U.S. and foreign laws, including economic sanctions, data privacy, and environmental laws and regulations;
● legislation introduced or enacted that could affect the Company’s business model and intellectual property, such as so-called right to repair or right to modify legislation; ● investigations, claims, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings; ● events that damage the Company’s reputation or brand; ● world grain stocks, available farm acres, soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, input costs (e.g., fertilizer), and availability of transport for crops; and ● housing starts and supply, real estate and housing prices, levels of public and non-residential construction, and infrastructure investment. 34
​ Further information concerning the Company and its businesses, including factors that could materially affect the Company’s financial results, is included in the Company’s other filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K). ​ Supplemental Consolidating Information The supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. The equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services. The equipment operations includes the Company’s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the equipment operations and financial services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements. The equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. The equipment operations primarily generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and selling equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services finances sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by the Company. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences. ​ 35

There has been no material change in this information. ​ Item 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective as of January 29, 2023, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. During the first quarter of 2023, there were no changes that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. ​ PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION ​ Item 1.    Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters. The Company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. ​ Item 1A.    Risk Factors See the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (Part I, Item 1A). There has been no material change in this information. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report, are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition, or operating results. One should not consider the risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. ​ Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The Company’s purchases of its common stock during the first quarter of 2023 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​      ​ ​      Total Number of      ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Shares Purchased as ​ Maximum Number of   ​ ​ Total Number of ​ ​ ​ ​ Part of Publicly ​ Shares that May Yet Be   ​ ​ Shares ​ ​ ​ ​ Announced Plans or ​ Purchased under the   ​ ​ Purchased (2) ​ Average Price ​ Programs (1) ​ Plans or Programs (1)   Period ​ (thousands) ​ Per Share ​ (thousands) ​ (millions)   Oct 31 to Nov 27 ​ 569
