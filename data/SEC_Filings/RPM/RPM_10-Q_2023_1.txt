We account for our investments in less-than-majority-owned joint ventures, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, under the equity method.
Effects of transactions between related companies are eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interests are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as if parent company investors (controlling interests) and other minority investors (noncontrolling interests) in partially-owned subsidiaries have similar economic interests in a single entity. As a result, investments in noncontrolling interests are reported as equity in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, our Consolidated Financial Statements include
100 % of a controlled subsidiary’s earnings, rather than only our share. Transactions between the parent company and noncontrolling interests are reported in equity as transactions between stockholders, provided that these transactions do not create a change in control. Our business is dependent on external weather factors. Historically, we have experienced strong sales and net income in our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters comprising the three-month periods ending August 31, November 30 and May 31, respectively, with weaker performance in our third fiscal quarter (December through February).
NOTE 2 —
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   New Accounting Pronouncements The Company has not adopted any Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) during fiscal 2023 that have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, there are no current ASU's issued, but not adopted, that are expected to have a material impact on the Company.
NOTE 3 — RESTRUCTURING We record restructuring charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to either reorganize one or more of our business segments, or to remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with our businesses. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of associates, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, contract cancellation costs and other costs. We record the short-term portion of our restructuring liability in Other Accrued Liabilities and the long-term portion, if any, in Other Long-Term Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Between May and August 2018, we approved and implemented the initial phases of a multi-year restructuring plan, which was originally referred to as the 2020 Margin Acceleration Plan (“MAP to Growth”). On May 31, 2021, we formally concluded our MAP to Growth, however, certain projects identified prior to that date will be completed throughout fiscal 2023. We incurred $ 1.2
and $ 2.6
million of restructuring costs for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively. We incurred $ 3.0
and $ 4.0
million of restructuring costs for the three and six months ended November 30, 2021, respectively. The current total expected costs associated with this plan are $ 121.3
million, of which $ 119.9
million has been incurred to date.
NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, marketable securities, notes and accounts payable, and debt. An allowance for credit losses is established for trade accounts receivable using assessments of current creditworthiness of customers, historical collection experience, the aging of receivables and other currently available evidence. Trade accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if a final determination of uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowance for doubtful collection of accounts are included in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense.

The valuation techniques utilized for establishing the fair values of assets and liabilities are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect management’s market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value, as follows: Level 1 Inputs
— Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 Inputs
— Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Level 3 Inputs
— Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers. The following tables present our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Our investments in available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities are valued using a market approach. The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For most of our financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. The contingent consideration represents the estimated fair value of the additional variable cash consideration payable in connection with recent acquisitions that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones. We estimated the fair value using expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled which is considered to be a Level 3 input. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we recorded an increase in the contingent consideration accrual related to acquisitions of $ 2.1
million and paid approximately $ 10.3
million to satisfy contingent consideration obligations relating to certain performance milestones that were established in prior periods and achieved during the current year. During the first half of fiscal 2022, we recorded an increase in the accrual for approximately $ 2.5
million related to fair value adjustments and paid approximately $ 5.7
million to satisfy contingent consideration obligations relating to certain performance milestones that were established in prior periods and achieved during fiscal 2022. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration for the amount recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date are reported in cash flows from financing activities, while payments of contingent consideration in excess of fair value as of the acquisition date, are reported in cash flows from operating activities within other accrued liabilities.
The carrying value of our current financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. At November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated using active market quotes, based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, which are Level 2 inputs.
Based on the analysis performed, the fair value and the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022 are as follows:

NOTE 7 — INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate of
24.9 % for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compares to the effective income tax rate of
23.3 % for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The effective income tax rate of
24.8 % for the six months ended November 30, 2022 compares to the effective income tax rate of
24.6 % for the six months ended November 30, 2021. The effective income tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 reflect variances from the
21 % statutory rate due primarily to the unfavorable impact of state and local income taxes, non-deductible business expenses, and the net tax on foreign subsidiary income resulting from the global intangible low-taxed income provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to equity compensation. Additionally, the effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022 reflect an unfavorable period-over-period tax rate differential on foreign earnings. Our deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings was $ 0.7
million as of November 30, 2022, which represents our estimate of the net tax cost associated with the remittance of $ 200.9
million of foreign earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. We have not provided for foreign withholding or income taxes on the remaining foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because such earnings have been retained and reinvested by the subsidiaries as of November 30, 2022. Accordingly,
no
provision has been made for foreign withholding or income taxes, which may become payable if the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted to us as dividends.

NOTE 9 — BORROWINGS 3.45% Notes due 2022 On November 15, 2022, we repaid the $ 300.0
million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our
3.45 % Notes due 2022. Revolving Credit Agreement During the quarter ended August 31, 2022, we amended our $ 1.3
billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which was set to expire on
October 31, 2023 . The amendment extended the expiration date to
August 1, 2027
and increased the borrowing capacity to $ 1.35
billion. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at either the base rate or the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), as defined, at our option, plus a spread determined by our debt rating. The amount outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility adjusted for deferred financing fees, net of amortization as of November 30, and May 31, 2022, was $ 699.0
and $ 442.2
million, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility is available to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital and capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. Term Loan Credit Facility Agreement On August 1, 2022, we amended the term loan credit facility, which was set to expire on
February 21, 2023 , to extend the maturity date to
August 1, 2025 , and paid down the borrowings outstanding on the term loan to $ 250
million. The term loan bears interest at either the base rate or the adjusted SOFR, as defined, at our option, plus a spread determined by our debt rating. The amount outstanding on the term loan adjusted for deferred financing fees, net of amortization as of November 30, and May 31, 2022, was $ 249.7
and $ 299.8
million, respectively.

NOTE 10 — STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On
January 8, 2008 , we announced our authorization of a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of RPM International Inc. common stock at management’s discretion. As announced on November 28, 2018, our goal was to return $ 1.0
billion in capital to stockholders by May 31, 2021 through share repurchases and the retirement of our convertible note during fiscal 2019.
On April 16, 2019, after taking into account share repurchases under our existing stock repurchase program to date, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the remaining $ 600.0
million in value of RPM International Inc. common stock by May 31, 2021.
As previously announced, given macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the Covid pandemic, we had suspended stock repurchases under the program, but in January 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of the stock repurchases. At the time of resuming the program, $ 469.7
million of shares of common stock remained available for repurchase. The Board of Directors also extended the stock repurchase program beyond its original
May 31, 2021
expiration date until such time that the remaining $ 469.7
million of capital has been returned to our stockholders. As a result, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at various times and in amounts and for prices that our management deems appropriate, subject to insider trading rules and other securities law restrictions. The timing of our purchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. We may limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time.
During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we did
no t repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program. During the six months ended November 30, 2022, we repurchased
303,079
shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $ 25.0
million, or an average of $ 82.49
per share.
During the six months ended November 30, 2021, we repurchased
133,388
shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $ 12.5
million, or an average of $ 93.71
per share.
The maximum dollar amount that may yet be repurchased under our stock repurchase program was approximately $ 342.3
million at November 30, 2022.

Due to a reduction in return on plan assets and higher interest costs which are only partially offset by a reduction in service cost due to higher discount rates, net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2023 is higher than our fiscal 2022 expense. We expect that pension expense will fluctuate on a year-to-year basis, depending upon the investment performance of plan assets and potential changes in interest rates, and these fluctuations may have a material impact on our consolidated financial results in the future.
We previously disclosed in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 that we are required and expect to contribute approximately $ 1.3
million to our retirement plans in the U.S. and approximately $ 4.9
million to plans outside the U.S. during the current fiscal year.
Throughout fiscal 2023, we will evaluate whether to make additional contributions.

NOTE 13 — CONTINGENCIES AND ACCRUED LOSSES Product Liability Matters We provide, through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries, certain insurance coverage, primarily product liability coverage, to our other subsidiaries. Excess coverage is provided by third-party insurers. Our product liability accruals provide for these potential losses as well as other uninsured claims.
Product liability accruals are established based upon actuarial calculations of potential liability using industry experience, actual historical experience and actuarial assumptions developed for similar types of product liability claims, including development factors and lag times.
To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that potential losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, we believe that the amount of any such additional loss would be immaterial to our results of operations, liquidity and consolidated financial position. Warranty Matters We also offer warranties on many of our products, as well as long-term warranty programs at certain of our businesses, and have established product warranty liabilities. We review these liabilities for adequacy on a quarterly basis and adjust them as necessary. The primary factors that could affect these liabilities may include changes in performance rates as well as costs of replacement. Provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale and periodically adjusted, as required, to reflect actual experience. It is probable that we will incur future losses related to warranty claims we have received but that have not been fully investigated and related to claims not yet received. While our warranty liabilities represent our best estimates at November 30, 2022, we can provide no assurances that we will not experience material claims in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to resolve such claims beyond the amounts accrued or beyond what we may recover from our suppliers. Based upon the nature of the expense, product warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales or within SG&A. Also, due to the nature of our businesses, the amount of claims paid can fluctuate from one period to the next.
While our warranty liabilities represent our best estimates of our expected losses at any given time, from time-to-time we may revise our estimates based on our experience relating to factors such as weather conditions, specific circumstances surrounding product installations and other factors. The following table includes the changes in our accrued warranty balances:

(1)	 Primarily claims paid during the period. Environmental Matters Like other companies participating in similar lines of business, some of our subsidiaries are involved in environmental remediation matters. It is our policy to accrue remediation costs when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have committed to an appropriate plan of action. We also take into consideration the estimated period of time over which payments may be required. The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation activities continue, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The liabilities are not offset by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state-managed sites, third-party indemnity obligations, and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites. 16
Other Contingencies One of our subsidiaries has been the subject of a proceeding in which one of its former distributors brought suit against our subsidiary for breach of contract. Following a June 2017 trial, a jury determined that the distributor was not entitled to any damages on the distributor’s claims against our subsidiary. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new trial with respect to certain issues. On December 10, 2021, a new jury awarded $ 6.0
million in damages to the distributor. Per the parties’ contracts, the distributor may also be entitled to recover some portion of its attorneys’ fees from our subsidiary. The distributor timely filed an appeal of the new jury's verdict, and our subsidiary timely filed a cross-appeal. The appeal action remains pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result of the jury’s award and in consideration of our subsidiary’s appeal, we accrued $ 2.6
million for this matter in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which we believe to be the low end of the range of loss. While an ultimate loss in excess of the accrued amount is reasonably possible, we believe that the high end of the range of loss would not be materially more than the $ 6.0
million noted above.
NOTE 14 — REVENUE We operate a portfolio of businesses that manufacture and sell a variety of product lines that include specialty paints, protective coatings, roofing systems, sealants and adhesives, among other things.
We disaggregate revenues from the sales of our products and services based upon geographical location by each of our reportable segments, which are aligned by similar economic factors, trends and customers, which best depict the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
See Note 15, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our disaggregated revenues, as well as a description of each of the unique revenue streams related to each of our
four
reportable segments. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time.
However, we also record revenues generated under construction contracts, mainly in connection with the installation of specialized roofing and flooring systems and related services. For certain polymer flooring installation projects, we account for our revenue using the output method, as we consider square footage of completed flooring to be the best measure of progress toward the complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
In contrast, for certain of our roofing installation projects, we account for our revenue using the input method, as that method was the best measure of performance as it considers costs incurred in relation to total expected project costs, which essentially represents the transfer of control for roofing systems to the customer.
In general, for our construction contracts, we record contract revenues and related costs as our contracts progress on an over-time model. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although our customers’ payment terms generally include a requirement to pay within 30 to 60 days of fulfilling our performance obligations .
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally
do not
include a significant financing component.
We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs, as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to control transfer. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and/or services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For example, judgment is required to determine whether products sold in connection with the sale of installation services are considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with installation services and recognized over time. We provide customer rebate programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. These customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration and recognized as a reduction of net sales.
Up-front consideration provided to customers is capitalized as a component of other assets and amortized over the estimated life of the contractual arrangement.
We include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. In general, this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale, and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to our volume-based incentives. This determination is updated each reporting period.
Certain of our contracts include contingent consideration that is receivable only upon the final inspection and acceptance of a project.
We include estimates of such variable consideration in our transaction price. Based on historical experience, we consider the probability-based expected value method appropriate to estimate the amount of such variable consideration. 17
Our products are generally sold with a right of return and we may provide other credits or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
We record a right of return liability to accrue for expected customer returns. Historical actual returns are used to estimate future returns as a percentage of current sales. Obligations for returns and refunds were not material individually or in the aggregate. We offer assurance type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term.
Warranty liabilities for our assurance type warranties are discussed further in Note 13, “Contingencies and Accrued Losses,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing customers. Our contract assets are recorded for products and services that have been provided to our customer but have not yet been billed and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our short-term contract liabilities consist of advance payments, or deferred revenue, and are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances, and net contract assets consisted of the following:

The $ 17.8
million increase in our net contract assets from May 31, 2022 to November 30, 2022, resulted primarily due to the timing of construction jobs in progress at November 30, 2022 versus May 31, 2022.
We also record long-term deferred revenue, which amounted to $ 59.9
million and $ 62.5
million as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively.
The long-term portion of deferred revenue is related to warranty contracts and is included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We have elected to adopt the practical expedient to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period for performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. As our contract terms are primarily one year or less in duration, we have elected to apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Allowance for Credit Losses Our primary allowance for credit losses is the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the trade accounts receivable balance to the estimated net realizable value equal to the amount that is expected to be collected. The allowance was based on assessments of current creditworthiness of customers, historical collection experience, the aging of receivables and other currently available evidence. Trade accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if a final determination of uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowances for doubtful collection of accounts are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses. The following tables summarize the activity for the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021:

NOTE 15 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We operate a portfolio of businesses and product lines that manufacture and sell a variety of specialty paints, protective coatings, roofing systems, flooring solutions, sealants, cleaners and adhesives. We manage our portfolio by organizing our businesses and product lines into
four
reportable segments as outlined below, which also represent our operating segments. Within each operating segment, we manage product lines and businesses which generally address common markets, share similar economic characteristics, utilize similar technologies and can share manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Our
four
operating segments represent components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate the assets of the company and evaluate performance. These four operating segments are each managed by an operating segment manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day operating decisions and performance evaluation of the operating segment’s underlying businesses. We evaluate the profit performance of our segments primarily based on income before income taxes, but also look to earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), as a performance evaluation measure because interest (income) expense, net is essentially related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations.
Our CPG reportable segment products are sold throughout North America and also account for the majority of our international sales. Our construction product lines are sold directly to contractors, distributors and end-users, such as industrial manufacturing facilities, public institutions and other commercial customers. Products and services within this reportable segment include construction sealants and adhesives, coatings and chemicals, roofing systems, concrete admixture and repair products, building envelope solutions, insulated cladding, flooring systems, and weatherproofing solutions.
Our PCG reportable segment products are sold throughout North America, as well as internationally, and are sold directly to contractors, distributors and end-users, such as industrial manufacturing facilities, public institutions and other commercial customers. Products and services within this reportable segment include high-performance flooring solutions, corrosion control and fireproofing coatings, infrastructure repair systems, fiberglass reinforced plastic gratings and drainage systems.
Our Consumer reportable segment manufactures and markets professional use and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) products for a variety of mainly consumer applications, including home improvement and personal leisure activities. Our Consumer reportable segment’s major manufacturing and distribution operations are located primarily in North America, along with a few locations in Europe and other parts of the world. Our Consumer reportable segment products are primarily sold directly to mass merchandisers, home improvement centers, hardware stores, paint stores, craft shops and through distributors. The Consumer reportable segment offers products that include specialty, hobby and professional paints; caulks; adhesives; cleaners; sandpaper and other abrasives; silicone sealants and wood stains. Our SPG reportable segment products are sold throughout North America and a few international locations, primarily in Europe. Our specialty product lines are sold directly to contractors, distributors and end-users, such as industrial manufacturing facilities, public institutions and other commercial customers. The SPG reportable segment offers products that include industrial cleaners, restoration services equipment, colorants, nail enamels, exterior finishes, edible coatings and specialty glazes for pharmaceutical and food industries, and other specialty original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) coatings. In addition to our four reportable segments, there is a category of certain business activities and expenses, referred to as corporate/other, that does not constitute an operating segment. This category includes our corporate headquarters and related administrative expenses, results of our captive insurance companies, gains or losses on the sales of certain assets and other expenses not directly associated with any reportable segment. Assets related to the corporate/other category consist primarily of investments, prepaid expenses and headquarters’ property and equipment. These corporate and other assets and expenses reconcile reportable segment data to total consolidated income before income taxes and identifiable assets. We reflect income from our joint ventures on the equity method and receive royalties from our licensees. 19
The following tables present a disaggregation of revenues by geography, and the results of our reportable segments consistent with our management philosophy, by representing the information we utilize, in conjunction with various strategic, operational and other financial performance criteria, in evaluating the performance of our portfolio of businesses.

ITEM 2.	 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our financial statements include all of our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries.
Investments in less-than-majority-owned joint ventures over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates, including those related to our allowances for doubtful accounts; reserves for excess and obsolete inventories; allowances for recoverable sales and/or value-added taxes; uncertain tax positions; useful lives of property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; environmental, warranties and other contingent liabilities; income tax valuation allowances; pension plans; and the fair value of financial instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience, our most recent facts, and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Actual results, which are shaped by actual market conditions, may differ materially from our estimates.
Goodwill
Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal 2022 did not result in any indicators of impairment. Should future earnings and cash flows at our reporting units decline, discount rates increase, and/or other relevant events and circumstances change that affect the fair value of our reporting units, future impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets may be required.
In August 2022, we announced our Margin Achievement Plan 2025 (“MAP 2025”) operational improvement initiative. Initial phases of the plan have focused on commercial initiatives, operational efficiencies, and procurement. However, due to the challenged macroeconomic environment, we are currently evaluating certain business restructuring actions, specifically our go to market strategy for certain businesses operating in Europe. As a result of these potential improvements and business restructuring actions, impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, and other long-lived assets, could be incurred.
A comprehensive discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that are the most critical to our financial statements are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2022.

(a)	The presentation includes a reconciliation of Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes, a measure defined by GAAP, to EBIT.
(b)	Interest Income (Expense), Net includes the combination of Interest Income (Expense) and Investment Income (Expense), Net.
(c)	EBIT is a non-GAAP measure, and is defined as Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes.
We evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT, as a performance evaluation measure because Interest (Income) Expense, Net is essentially related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations.
We believe EBIT is useful to investors for this purpose as well, using EBIT as a metric in their investment decisions.
EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest in determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our continued operations,
23
given our level of indebtedness.
Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that this measure is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance.
We also evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing.
Our underwriters and bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt underwriting or bank financing.
EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results.

(1) Organic growth includes the impact of price and volume.
Our CPG segment generated organic sales growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 when compared to the same quarter in the prior year driven by strength in restoration systems for commercial roofing, facades, and parking structures. Additionally, the segment's concrete admixtures and repair business continued to benefit from market share gains. Improved pricing in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to sales growth during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by deteriorating economic conditions in Europe and reduced demand for businesses that serve the new residential home construction market.
Our PCG segment generated significant organic sales growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 in nearly all the major business units in the segment when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Performing particularly well were businesses that provide flooring systems, protective coatings and fiberglass reinforced plastic grating, all of which were strategically well-positioned to benefit from growing vertical markets such as semiconductor chip manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, as well as energy. This increase was also facilitated by improved pricing in response to continued cost inflation.
Our Consumer segment generated significant organic sales growth in comparison to the prior year due to improved pricing to catch up with continued cost inflation and strong sales growth in North America. The prior year comparison was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions as a result of reduced raw material supply, particularly of alkyd-based resins.
Our SPG segment generated significant organic sales growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, particularly those businesses serving the food coatings and additives market, as a result of strategically refocusing sales management and selling efforts. The segment's disaster restoration business benefited from the response to Hurricane Ian and improved material supply compared to a low prior year comparison when semiconductor chip shortages prevented the business from meeting customer demand.
Gross Profit Margin
Our consolidated gross profit margin of 38.5% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compares to a consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for the comparable period a year ago.
The current quarter gross profit margin increase of approximately 3.0%, or 300 basis points (“bps”), resulted primarily from the realization of production efficiencies due to improved raw material supply and higher selling prices in response to continued cost inflation. In addition, our Map to Growth and MAP 2025, together MAP initiatives, resulted in incremental savings that favorably impacted our gross margin. Partially offsetting these improvements were continued inflation in raw materials and wages.
We expect that these increased costs will continue to be reflected in our results throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023. In addition, rising interest rates have negatively impacted construction activity, existing home sales, and overall economic activity, resulting in reduced customer demand which we expect to continue into the third quarter.
SG&A
Our consolidated SG&A expense during the period was $52.9 million higher versus the same period last year and increased to 27.3% of net sales from 26.7% of net sales for the prior year quarter.
Variable costs associated with improved results such as commission expense and bonuses were contributing factors. In addition, pay inflation and professional fees associated with our MAP 2025 initiatives contributed to this increase. Additional SG&A expense recognized by companies we recently acquired approximated $3.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
Our CPG segment SG&A was approximately $12.2 million higher for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period and increased as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in expense was mainly due to higher distribution costs, pay inflation, as well as restoration of travel expenses compared to the prior year and investments in growth initiatives. Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $1.8 million of additional SG&A expense.
24
Our PCG segment SG&A was approximately $12.4 million higher for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period and increased as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in expense as compared to the prior year period is mainly due to increased commissions as a result of higher volume as well as higher incentive compensation, pay inflation, increased bad debt expense, and the restoration of travel expenses after COVID. Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $0.3 million of additional SG&A expense.
Our Consumer segment SG&A increased by approximately $15.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the same period last year, but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A was attributable to pay inflation and restoration of travel expenses, as well as increases in advertising, promotional expense, incentive compensation, and distribution costs.
Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $0.9 million of additional SG&A expense.
Our SPG segment SG&A was approximately $2.7 million higher during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in SG&A expense is attributable to pay inflation and investments in growth initiatives across each of its business units, partially offset by a charge recorded during the prior year period related to the legal matter described above in Note 13, "Contingencies and Other Accrued Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $0.5 million of additional SG&A expense.
SG&A expenses in our corporate/other category increased by $10.2 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to last year’s second quarter mainly due to higher professional fees related to our MAP 2025 operational improvement initiatives.
The following table summarizes the retirement-related benefit plans’ impact on income before income taxes for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, as the service cost component has a significant impact on our SG&A expense:

Our CPG segment, the most internationally concentrated segment, results reflect the negative impact of deteriorated macroeconomic conditions in Europe and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In addition, our prior year CPG segment results include a $41.9 million gain on the sale of certain real property assets.
Our PCG segment results reflect improved pricing in response to continued cost inflation, volume growth and improved product mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our Consumer segment results reflect improved pricing to catch up to continued cost inflation and improved material supply which led to improved operating efficiencies.
Our SPG segment results reflect improved pricing in response to continued cost inflation, as well as increased operating efficiencies due to improved material supply.
Our Non-Op segment results reflect the unfavorable swing in pension non-service costs, along with increased interest expense and professional fees.
Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate of 24.9% for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compares to the effective income tax rate of 23.3% for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The effective income tax rates for the presented periods reflect variances from the 21% statutory rate due primarily to the impact of state and local income taxes, non-deductible business expenses and the net tax on foreign subsidiary income resulting from the global intangible low-taxed income provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to equity compensation. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022 reflects an unfavorable period-over-period tax rate differential on foreign earnings.

(1) Organic growth includes the impact of price and volume.
Our CPG segment generated significant organic sales growth during the first half of fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period driven by strength in restoration systems for commercial roofing, facades and parking structures. Additionally, the segment's concrete admixtures and repair business benefited from market share gains. Improved pricing in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to sales growth during the first six months of the year. This growth was partially offset by deteriorating economic conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange translation in Europe, along with reduced demand for businesses that serve the new residential home construction market.
26
Our PCG segment generated significant sales growth during the first half of fiscal 2023 in nearly all the major business units in the segment when compared to the same period in the prior year. Performing particularly well were businesses that provide flooring systems, protective coatings, and fiberglass reinforced plastic grating, all of which were strategically well-positioned to benefit from growing vertical markets such as semiconductor chip manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, as well as energy. This increase was also facilitated by strong demand in energy markets and price increases in response to continued cost inflation. Internationally, unfavorable foreign exchange translation was a headwind, particularly in Europe, but growth in emerging markets was strong in local currency.
Our Consumer segment generated significant organic growth during the first half of fiscal 2023 in comparison to the prior year period due to improved raw material supply, particularly of alkyd-based resins secured through strategic investment in its supply chain, insourcing, and qualifying new suppliers, resulting in improved product availability. In addition, sales growth benefitted from price increases to catch up with continued cost inflation and the prior year comparison when supply chain disruptions impacted raw material supply, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation, particularly in Europe.
Our SPG segment generated significant sales growth during the first half of fiscal 2023, particularly those businesses serving the food coatings and additives market, as a result of strategically refocusing sales management and selling efforts. The segment's disaster restoration business also benefited from the response to Hurricane Ian and worked through backlog after resolving previous semiconductor chip supply shortages. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation.
Gross Profit Margin
Our consolidated gross profit margin of 38.5% of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2023 compares to a consolidated gross profit margin of 36.4% for the comparable period a year ago.
The current period gross profit margin increase of approximately 2.1%, or 210 basis points (“bps”), resulted primarily from higher selling prices catching up with continued cost inflation as well as the realization of production efficiencies due to improved raw material supply, savings from MAP initiatives, and improved sales. Partially offsetting these improvements were continued inflation in raw materials and wages.
We expect that these increased costs will continue to be reflected in our results throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023. In addition, rising interest rates have negatively impacted construction activity, existing home sales, and overall economic activity, resulting in reduced customer demand which we expect to continue into the third quarter.
SG&A
Our consolidated SG&A expense during the period was $119.1 million higher versus the same period last year and increased to 26.2% of net sales from 26.0% of net sales for the prior year period.
Variable costs associated with improved results such as commission expense and bonuses were contributing factors. In addition, professional fees associated with our MAP 2025 initiatives and pay inflation contributed to this increase. Additional SG&A expense recognized by companies we recently acquired approximated $7.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2023.
Our CPG segment SG&A was approximately $27.9 million higher for the first half of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in expense was mainly due to higher distribution costs, higher commission expense associated with higher sales, pay inflation, as well as restoration of discretionary spending (i.e. meetings, travel, etc.) compared to the prior year and investments in growth initiatives. Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $4.6 million of additional SG&A expense.
Our PCG segment SG&A was approximately $23.5 million higher for the first half of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in expense as compared to the prior year period is mainly due to increased commissions, higher distribution costs, pay inflation, increased bad debt expense, along with restoration of travel expenses and investments in growth initiatives for diversification of its industrial coatings business. Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $0.3 million of additional SG&A expense.
Our Consumer segment SG&A increased by approximately $33.0 million during the first half of fiscal 2023 versus the same period last year, but decreased as a percentage of net sales.
The period over period increase in SG&A was attributable to increases in advertising and promotional expense, increased distribution costs, pay inflation, and the restoration of travel expenses.
Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $1.8 million of additional SG&A expense.
Our SPG segment SG&A was approximately $8.1 million higher during the first half of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable prior year period but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in SG&A expense is attributable to pay inflation and investments in growth initiatives across each of its business units, partially offset by a charge recorded during the prior year period related to the legal matter described above in Note 13, "Contingencies and Other Accrued Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, companies recently acquired generated approximately $0.8 million of additional SG&A expense.
SG&A expenses in our corporate/other category increased by $26.6 million during the first half of fiscal 2023 as compared to last year’s first half mainly due to higher professional fees related to operational improvement initiatives.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Fiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022
Operating Activities
Approximately $190.9 million of cash was provided by operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared with $159.4 million of cash provided by operating activities during the same period last year.
The net change in cash from operations includes the change in net income, which increased by $40.9 million during the first six months of fiscal 2023 versus the same period during fiscal 2022.
During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the change in accounts receivable provided approximately $7.6 million less cash than the first six months of fiscal 2022. Average days sales outstanding (“DSO”) at November 30, 2022, increased to 64.5 days from 64.2 days at November 30, 2021.
During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the change in inventory used approximately $64.5 million more cash compared to our spending during the same period a year ago, as a result of material price inflation and strategic build-up of inventory to improve supply chain resiliency. Average days of inventory outstanding (“DIO”) was approximately 102.3 and 85.9 days at November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The change in accounts payable during the first six months of fiscal 2023 used approximately $66.2 million more cash than during the first six months of fiscal 2022 due principally to the timing of purchases which were suppressed by supply constraints at the end of fiscal year 2021 and reduced purchases in fiscal 2023 due to elevated inventory levels and improved supply chain conditions. Average days payables outstanding (“DPO”) increased, however, by approximately 5.1 days to 86.5 days at November 30, 2022 from 81.4 days at November 30, 2021.
The change in other accrued liabilities during the first six months of fiscal 2023 provided approximately $76.0 million more cash than during the first six months of fiscal 2022 due principally to the timing of income taxes payable, increase in consulting cost accruals and the increase in customer rebate accruals.
Investing Activities
For the first six months of fiscal 2023, cash used for investing activities decreased by $4.4 million to $164.0 million as compared to $168.4 million in the prior year period.
This year-over-year decrease in cash used for investing activities was mainly driven by a $66.7 million decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, and the sales of assets which provided $50.6 million of proceeds in the prior year period.
We paid for capital expenditures of $113.5 million and $101.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.
Our capital expenditures facilitate our continued growth, allow us to achieve production and distribution efficiencies, expand capacity, introduce new technology, improve environmental health and safety capabilities, improve information systems, and enhance our administration capabilities. We continue to increase capital spending in fiscal 2023, to expand capacity to continue our growth initiatives.
Our captive insurance companies invest their excess cash in marketable securities in the ordinary course of conducting their operations, and this activity will continue. Differences in the amounts related to these activities on a year-over-year basis are primarily attributable to differences in the timing and performance of their investments balanced against amounts required to satisfy claims. At November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the fair value of our investments in available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities, which includes captive insurance-related assets, totaled $143.6 million and $144.4 million, respectively.
The fair value of our portfolio of
29
marketable securities is based on quoted market prices for identical, or similar, instruments in active or non-active markets or model-derived-valuations with observable inputs. We have no marketable securities whose fair value is subject to unobservable inputs.
As of November 30, 2022, approximately $217.2 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries, compared with $187.1 million at May 31, 2022.
Undistributed earnings held at our foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested will be used, for instance, to expand operations organically or for acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions.
Further, our operations in the U.S. generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy U.S. operating requirements.
Refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unremitted foreign earnings.
Financing Activities
For the first six months of fiscal 2023, financing activities provided $14.2 million of cash, which compares to cash used for financing activities of $26.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2022.
The overall increase in cash provided by financing activities was driven principally by debt-related activities.
During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we provided approximately $413.4 million more cash from additions to short and long-term debt, as a result of additional net borrowings of approximately $267.7 million on our revolving credit facility and utilizing our $250 million AR Program. We also used approximately $351.1 million more cash to paydown existing debt during the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of repaying our $300 million 3.45% Notes due 2022.
See below for further details on the significant components of our debt.
Our available liquidity, including our cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our committed credit facilities, stood at $880.0 million and $1.31 billion as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively.
Revolving Credit Agreement
During the quarter ended August 31, 2022, we amended our $1.3 billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which was set to expire on October 31, 2023. The amendment extended the expiration date to August 1, 2027 and increased the borrowing capacity to $1.35 billion. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at either the base rate or the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), as defined, at our option, plus a spread determined by our debt rating. The Revolving Credit Facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans, which are comparatively short-term loans used for working capital purposes and letters of credit. The aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be expanded upon our request, subject to certain conditions, up to $1.5 billion. The Revolving Credit Facility is available to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital and capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage covenant (i.e., Net Leverage Ratio) and interest coverage ratio, which are calculated in accordance with the terms as defined by the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the leverage covenant, we may not permit our leverage ratio for total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent fiscal quarters to exceed 3.75 to 1.00. During certain periods and per the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, this ratio may be increased to 4.25 to 1.00 upon delivery of a notice to our lender requesting an increase to our maximum leverage or in connection with certain “material acquisitions.” The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio for EBITDA to interest expense is 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended using EBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of November 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in our Revolving Credit Facility, including the Net Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio covenants. At that date, our Net Leverage Ratio was 2.53 to 1.00, while our Interest Coverage Ratio was 10.64 to 1.00. As of November 30, 2022, we had $647.9 million of borrowing availability on our Revolving Credit Facility.
Our access to funds under our Revolving Credit Facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to the Revolving Credit Facility to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our Revolving Credit Facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others .
Accounts Receivable Securitization Program
As of November 30, 2022, we had an outstanding balance under our accounts receivable securitization program (the "AR Program") of $250.0 million.
The maximum availability under the AR Program is $250.0 million, but availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the $250.0 million of funding available under the AR Program.
30
The AR Program contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary default and termination provisions.
Our failure to comply with the covenants described above and other covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under that agreement, entitling the lenders to, among other things, declare the entire amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately. The instruments governing our other outstanding indebtedness generally include cross-default provisions that provide that, under certain circumstances, an event of default that results in acceleration of our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility will entitle the holders of such other indebtedness to declare amounts outstanding immediately due and payable. See “Revolving Credit Agreement” above for details on our compliance with all significant financial covenants at November 30, 2022.
Term Loan Facility Credit Agreement
On August 1, 2022, we amended the term loan credit facility, which was set to expire on February 21, 2023, to extend the maturity date to August 1, 2025, and paid down the borrowings outstanding on the term loan to $250 million. The term loan bears interest at either the base rate or the adjusted SOFR, as defined, at our option, plus a spread determined by our debt rating. The term loan contains customary covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on our ability, and in certain instances, our subsidiaries’ ability, to incur liens, make certain investments, or sell or transfer assets. Additionally, we may not permit (i) our consolidated interest coverage ratio to be less than 3.50 to 1.00, or (ii) our leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent fiscal quarters) to exceed 3.75 to 1.00.
During certain periods this ratio may be increased to 4.25 to 1.0 upon delivery of a notice to our lender requesting an increase to our maximum leverage or in connection with certain “material acquisitions.” See “Revolving Credit Agreement” above for details on our compliance with all significant financial covenants at November 30, 2022.
Refer to Note G, "Borrowings," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 for more comprehensive details on the significant components of our debt.

ITEM 3.	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk from changes in raw materials costs, interest rates and foreign exchange rates since we fund our operations through long- and short-term borrowings and conduct our business in a variety of foreign currencies. There were no material potential changes in our exposure to these market risks since May 31, 2022.
However, refer to the "Gross Profit Margin" paragraphs in the "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" for the "Three Months Ended November 30, 2022" and "Six Months Ended November 30, 2022" sections above, for additional details on recent inflationary cost pressure.
ITEM 4.	 CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES
(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of November 30, 2022 (the “Evaluation Date”), have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
32
PART II — OTHE R INFORMATION
ITEM 1.	 LEGA L PROCEEDINGS
Environmental Proceedings
Like other companies participating in similar lines of business, some of our subsidiaries are identified as a “potentially responsible party” under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar local environmental statutes or are participating in the cost of certain clean-up efforts or other remedial actions relating to environmental matters. Our share of such costs to date, however, has not been material and management believes that these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 1 — Business — Environmental Matters,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2022.
As permitted by SEC rules, and given the size of our operations, we have elected to adopt a quantitative threshold for environmental proceedings of $1 million.
As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any matters that exceed this threshold and meet the definition for disclosure.
ITEM 1A.	 RI SK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the other risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022.
