Contents THE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Amounts in thousands, except par values and per share data) 1.     BUSINESS The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Hain Celestial,” “we,” “us” or “our”), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer, and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug, and convenience stores in over
75
countries worldwide. The Company operates under
two
reportable segments: North America and International.
Acquisition On December 28, 2021, the
Company acquired all outstanding stock of Proven Brands, Inc. (and its subsidiary That's How We Roll LLC) and KTB Foods Inc., collectively doing business as "That's How We Roll" ("THWR"), the producer and marketer of ParmCrisps ®
and Thinsters ® . See Note 4,
Acquisition and Disposition,
for details. 2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliated companies in which the Company exerts significant influence, but which it does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As such, consolidated net income includes the Company's equity in the current earnings or losses of such companies.
The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”). The amounts as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2022 are derived from the Company’s audited annual financial statements. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which, in management’s opinion, are necessary for a fair presentation for interim periods. Operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Please refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 and for the fiscal year then ended included in the Form 10-K for information not included in these condensed notes. All amounts in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, notes and tables have been rounded to the nearest thousand, except par values and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. Significant Accounting Policies The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K. Included herein are certain updates to those policies. Transfer of Financial Assets The Company accounts for transfers of financial assets, such as non-recourse accounts receivable financing arrangements, when the Company has surrendered control over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred requires an evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company’s continuing involvement with the assets
9 Table of
Contents transferred and any other relevant considerations.
The Company has non-recourse financing arrangements in which eligible receivables are sold to third-party buyers in exchange for cash. The Company transferred accounts receivable in their entirety to the buyers and satisfied all of the conditions to re port the transfer of financial assets in their entirety as a sale. The principal amount of receivables sold under these arrangements w as $ 189,794
and $ 64,133
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The incremental cost of financing receivables
under these arrangements is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The proceeds from the sale of receivables are included in cash used in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting". The guidance allows for companies to: (1) account for certain contract modifications as a continuation of the existing contract without additional analysis; (2) continue hedge accounting when certain critical terms of a hedging relationship change and assess effectiveness in ways that disregard certain potential sources of ineffectiveness; and (3) make a one-time sale and/or transfer of certain debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale or trading. This ASU is available for adoption by the Company and applies prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships. ASU 2020-04 is currently effective and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the provisions of Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. ASU 2020-04 allows for different elections to be made at different points in time and the timing of those elections will be documented as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company intends to reassess its elections of optional expedients and exceptions included within ASU 2020-04 related to its hedging activities and will document the election of these items on a quarterly basis or when changes/additions are necessary. During fiscal year 2023, the Company adopted hedge accounting expedients related to probability of forecasted transactions to assert probability of the hedged interest (payments/receipts) regardless of any expected modification in terms related to reference rate reform. The Company has also adopted the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the alternative reference rate to replace LIBOR with respect to the Company’s long-term debt. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. 3.     EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share utilized to calculate earnings per share on the Consolidated Statements of Operations:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 10,966   $ 30,889   $ 17,889   $ 50,300   Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Some of the Company’s leases contain variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred unless those payments are based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at lease commencement and included in the measurement of the lease liability; thereafter, changes to lease payments due to rate or index changes are recorded as variable lease expense in the period incurred. The Company does not have any related party leases, and sublease transactions are de minimis. 13 Table of

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On December 22, 2021, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facility by entering into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by a First Amendment dated December 16, 2022, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $ 1,100,000
in the aggregate, consisting of (1) $ 300,000
in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the “Term Loans”) and (2) an $ 800,000
senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and is comprised of a $ 440,000
U.S. revolving credit facility and $ 360,000
global revolving credit facility) (the “Revolver”). Both the Revolver and the Term Loans mature on December 22, 2026. The Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated secured leverage ratio. The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is
2.75 :1.00. The maximum consolidated leverage ratio is
6.00 :1.00. Through December 31, 2023 or such earlier date as elected by the Company (the “Amendment Period”), the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio is
5.00 :1.00. Following the Amendment Period, the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio will be
4.25 :1.00, subject to possible temporary increase following certain corporate acquisitions. During the Amendment Period, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a credit spread adjustment of
0.10 % (as adjusted, “Term SOFR”) plus
2.0 % per annum or (b) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus
1.0 % per annum. Following the Amendment Period, loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) Term SOFR plus a rate ranging from
0.875 % to
1.750 % per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus a rate ranging from
0.00 % to
0.750 % per annum, the relevant rate in each case being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate following the Amendment Period will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2022 was
5.59 %. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the amount unused under the Credit Agreement ranging from
0.15 % to
0.25 % per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid. As of December 31, 2022, there were $ 587,000
of loans under the Revolver, $ 292,500
of Term Loans, and $ 6,769
of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, $ 206,231
was available under the Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with the financial covenants. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all associated covenants. 16 Table of
Contents Credit Agreement Issuance Costs In connection with the First Amendment to its Credit Agreement during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $ 1,987 , of which $ 1,916
was deferred. Of the total deferred costs, $ 1,396
were associated with the Revolver and are being amortized on a straight-line basis within Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $ 520
are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the Term Loans as a component of Interest and other financing expense, net over the term of the Credit Agreement. Maturities of all debt instruments at December 31, 2022, are as follows: Due in Fiscal Year Amount Remainder of 2023 $ 3,729   2024 7,361   2025 7,343   2026 7,320   2027 852,649   Total debt and borrowings $ 878,402   10.     INCOME TAXES
In general, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision for income taxes. Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability on the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements. The effective income tax rate was an expense of
36.0 % and
18.6 % for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate was an expense of
32.6 % and
18.6 % for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the gain on the sale of Westbrae, an operating lease modification during the second quarter, severance with respect to our former CEO (as part of the limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation), stock-based compensation and uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the reversal of uncertain tax position accruals based on filing of certain elections by taxing authorities, deductions related to stock-based compensation, non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of THWR, and the reversal of a valuation allowance due to the utilization of a capital loss carryover. The effective income tax rates in each period were also impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and state income taxes. 17 Table of

Under the Company's Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the "2002 Plan"), the Company historically granted equity-based awards to its officers, senior management, other key employees, consultants, and directors. The Company currently utilizes a stockholder-approved plan, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. 2022 Long Term Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2022 Plan”) which was approved at the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 17, 2022. The 2022 Plan permits the Company to continue making equity-based and other incentive awards in a manner intended to properly incentivize its employees, directors, consultants and other service providers by aligning their interests with the interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Company also historically granted shares under its 2019 Equity Inducement Award Program (the "2019 Inducement Program") to induce selected individuals to become employees of the Company. The 2002 Plan, the 2022 Plan and the 2019 Inducement Program are collectively referred to as the "Stock Award Plans." In conjunction with the Stock Award Plans, the Company maintains a long-term incentive program (the “LTI Program” or "LTIP") that provides for equity awards, including performance and market-based equity awards that can be earned over defined performance periods. The Company's LTIP plans, with the exception of the 2023 - 2025 LTIP described below, are described in Note 13,
Stock-Based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K.

The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These levels are: • Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; • Level 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and • Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022:  Total Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Derivative financial instruments $ 15,101   $ —   $ 15,101   $ —   Equity investment 2   2   —   —   Total $ 15,103   $ 2   $ 15,101   $ —   The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2022: Total Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Derivative financial instruments $ 7,476   $ —   $ 7,476   $ —   Equity investment 560   560   —   —   Total $ 8,036   $ 560   $ 7,476   $ —   Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments 3,184   —   3,184   —   Total $ 3,184   $ —   $ 3,184   $ —   There were no transfers of financial instruments between the three levels of fair value hierarchy during the six months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. 21 Table of
Contents Derivative Instruments The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk and cross-currency swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the Company’s nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of the Company’s derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to its derivative contracts, which determination was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, all of the derivatives held as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 15.     DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s receivables and borrowings. Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company’s cash receipts and payments in terms of the Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain assets and liabilities in terms of its functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCL related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable rate debt. During the remaining six months of fiscal 2023, the Company estimates that an additional $ 3,664
will be rec lassified as
a decrease
to interest expense. 22 Table of
Contents As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:
Interest Rate Derivative Number of Instruments Notional Amount Interest Rate Swap 8 $ 630,000 Cash Flow Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivatives including cross-currency swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-EUR exchange rates. Cross-currency swaps involve exchanging fixed-rate interest payments for fixed-rate interest receipts, both of which will occur at the USD-EUR forward exchange rates in effect upon entering into the instr ument. The Company, at times, also uses forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the GBP-EUR exchange rates. The Company designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risks. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings within the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction . During the remaining six months of fiscal 2023, the Company estimates that
an additional $ 46
relating to cro ss-currency swaps will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its foreign exchange risks: Foreign Currency Derivative Number of Instruments Notional Sold Notional Purchased Foreign currency forward contract 3 £ 2,590 € 3,000 Net Investment Hedges The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in its European foreign entities and their exposure to the Euro. The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the foreign exchange rate on its foreign investment in Europe. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the USD-EUR exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in U.S. Dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. Cross-currency swaps involve the receipt of functional-currency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making foreign-currency- fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement.
For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its net investments in foreign operations: Foreign Currency Derivative Number of Instruments Notional Sold Notional Purchased Cross-currency swap 4 € 100,300 $ 105,804 Fair Value Hedges The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its foreign denominated intercompany loans due to changes in foreign exchange spot rates. The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates affecting gains and losses on intercompany loan principal and interest. Cross-currency swaps involve the receipt of functional-currency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making foreign-currency-fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement.
23 Table of
Contents For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest and other financing expense, net. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy election. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. During the remaining six months of fiscal 2023, the Company estimates that an additional $ 239
relating to cross currency swaps will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

The  three  complaints are: (1)
Flora v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al.
(the “Flora Complaint”); (2)
Lynn v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al.
(the “Lynn Complaint”); and (3)
Spadola v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al.
(the “Spadola Complaint” and, together with the Flora and Lynn Complaints, the “Securities Complaints”). On June 5, 2017, the District Court issued an order for consolidation, appointment of Co-Lead Plaintiffs and approval of selection of co-lead counsel.
28 Table of
Contents Pursuant to this order, the Securities Complaints were consolidated under the caption In re The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Securities Litigation (the “Consolidated Securities Action”), and Rosewood Funeral Home and Salamon Gimpel were appointed as Co-Lead Plaintiffs. On June 21, 2017, the Company received notice that plaintiff Spadola voluntarily dismissed his claims without prejudice to his ability to participate in the Consolidated Securities Action as an absent class member. The Co-Lead Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Securities Action filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint on August 4, 2017 and a Corrected Consolidated Amended Complaint on September 7, 2017 on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Hain Celestial securities between November 5, 2013 and February 10, 2017 (the “Amended Complaint”). The Amended Complaint named as defendants the Company and certain of its former officers (collectively, “Defendants”) and asserted violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases and SEC filings regarding the Company’s business, prospects, financial results and internal controls. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on October 3, 2017 which the District Court granted on March 29, 2019, dismissing the case in its entirety, without prejudice to replead. Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on May 6, 2019 (the “Second Amended Complaint”). The Second Amended Complaint again named as defendants the Company and certain of its former officers and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations similar to those in the Amended Complaint, including materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases and SEC filings regarding the Company’s business, prospects, financial results, and internal controls. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on June 20, 2019. On April 6, 2020, the District Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. Co-Lead Plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision dismissing the Second Amended Complaint to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the "Second Circuit"). By decision dated December 17, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the District Court’s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. On April 6, 2022, the District Court issued an order directing the parties to submit position papers outlining their views regarding: (a) the scope of the Court's reconsideration of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint; and (b) the appropriate procedure the Court should follow in light of the Second Circuit's opinion. On April 14, 2022, the District Court entered an order setting the schedule for, and determining the scope of, supplemental briefing on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The parties submitted supplemental briefing between May 12, 2022 and June 23, 2022. In June 2022, the District Court referred Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint to a United States Magistrate Judge (the “Magistrate Judge”) for a Report and Recommendation. On November 4, 2022, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the District Court grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed Objections to Magistrate Judge’s November 4, 2022 Report and Recommendation on December 7, 2022, and Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Objections to Magistrate Judge’s November 4, 2022 Report and Recommendation on January 9, 2023. The Parties await a decision from the District Court on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. Additional Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Complaints Filed in Federal Court On April 19, 2017 and April 26, 2017,  two  class action and stockholder derivative complaints were filed in the Eastern District of New York against the former Board of Directors and certain former officers of the Company under the captions Silva v. Simon, et al. (the “Silva Complaint”) and Barnes v. Simon, et al. (the “Barnes Complaint”), respectively. Both the Silva Complaint and the Barnes Complaint allege violation of securities law, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.
On May 23, 2017, an additional stockholder filed a complaint under seal in the Eastern District of New York against the former Board of Directors and certain former officers of the Company. The complaint alleged that the Company’s former directors and certain former officers made materially false and misleading statements in press releases and SEC filings regarding the Company’s business, prospects and financial results. The complaint also alleged that the Company violated its by-laws and Delaware law by failing to hold its 2016 Annual Stockholders Meeting and includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and corporate waste. On August 9, 2017, the District Court granted an order to unseal this case and reveal Gary Merenstein as the plaintiff (the “Merenstein Complaint”). On August 10, 2017, the District Court granted the parties' stipulation to consolidate the Barnes Complaint, the Silva Complaint and the Merenstein Complaint under the caption In re The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Stockholder Class and Derivative Litigation (the “Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action”) and to appoint Robbins Arroyo LLP and Scott+Scott as Co-Lead Counsel, with the Law Offices of Thomas G. Amon as Liaison Counsel for Plaintiffs. On September 14, 2017, a related complaint was filed under the caption Oliver v. Berke, et al. (the “Oliver Complaint”), and on October 6, 2017, the Oliver Complaint was consolidated with the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action. The Plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint under seal on October 26, 2017. On December 20, 2017, the parties agreed to stay Defendants’ time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the consolidated amended complaint through and including 30 days
29 Table of
Contents after a decision was rendered on the motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action, described above. On March 29, 2019, the District Court in the Consolidated Securities Action granted Defendants’ motion, dismissing the Amended Complaint in its entirety, without prejudice to replead. Co-Lead Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Securities Action filed the Second Amended Complaint on May 6, 2019. The parties to the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action agreed to continue the stay of Defendants’ time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the consolidated amended complaint through 30 days after a decision on Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action. On April 6, 2020, the District Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action, with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the stay, Defendants in the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action had until May 6, 2020 to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the complaint in this matter. This deadline was extended, and Defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action Complaint on June 23, 2020, with Plaintiffs’ opposition due August 7, 2020.
On July 24, 2020, Plaintiffs made a stockholder litigation demand on the current Board containing overlapping factual allegations to those set forth in the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action. On August 10, 2020, the District Court vacated the briefing schedule on Defendants’ pending motion to dismiss in order to give the Board of Directors time to consider the demand. On each of September 8 and October 8, 2020, the District Court extended its stay of any applicable deadlines for 30 days to give the Board of Directors additional time to complete its evaluation of the demand. On November 3, 2020, Plaintiffs were informed that the Board of Directors had finished investigating and resolved, among other things, that the demand should be rejected. On November 6, 2020, Plaintiffs and Defendants notified the District Court that Plaintiffs were evaluating the rejection of the demand, sought certain additional information and were assessing next steps, and requested that the District Court extend the stay for an additional 30 days, to on or around December 7, 2020. The Parties then filed a number of additional joint status reports, requesting that the District Court continue the stay of applicable deadlines through December 30, 2021. In light of the Second Circuit vacating the District Court’s judgment in the Consolidated Securities Action referenced above and remanding the case for further proceedings, the Parties submitted a joint status report on December 29, 2021 requesting that the District Court continue the temporary stay pending the District Court’s reconsideration of the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Com plaint in the Consolidated Securities Action. The District Court has extended the temporary stay through April 30, 2023. Baby Food Litigation Since February 2021, the Company has been named in numerous consumer class actions alleging that the Company’s Earth’s Best ®
baby food products (the “Products”) contain unsafe and undisclosed levels of various naturally occurring heavy metals, namely lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury. Those actions have now been transferred and consolidated as a single lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned In re Hain Celestial Heavy Metals Baby Food Litigation, Case No. 2:21-cv-678 (the "Consolidated Proceeding"), which generally alleges that the Company violated various state consumer protection laws and asserts other state and common law warranty and unjust enrichment claims related to the alleged failure to disclose the presence of these metals, arguing that consumers would have either not purchased the Products or would have paid less for them had the Company made adequate disclosures. The Court appointed interim class counsel for Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Proceeding, and Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on March 18, 2022. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint on November 7, 2022. The plaintiffs filed their opposition on December 22, 2022, and the Company filed its reply brief on January 20, 2023. One consumer class action is pending in New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, which the court has stayed in deference to the Consolidated Proceeding. The Company denies the allegations in these lawsuits and contends that its baby foods are safe and properly labeled. The claims raised in these lawsuits were brought in the wake of a highly publicized report issued by the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on Oversight and Reform, dated February 4, 2021 (the “House Report”), addressing the presence of heavy metals in baby foods made by certain manufacturers, including the Company. Since the publishing of the House Report, the Company has also received information requests with respect to the advertising and quality of its baby foods from certain governmental authorities, as such authorities investigate the claims made in the House Report. The Company is fully cooperating with these requests and is providing documents and other requested information. The Company has been named in one civil government enforcement action, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. Nurture, Inc., et al., which was filed by the New Mexico Attorney General against the Company and several other manufacturers based on the alleged presence of heavy metals in their baby food products. The Company and several other manufacturers moved to dismiss the New Mexico Attorney General’s lawsuit, which motion the Court denied. The Company filed its answer to the New Mexico Attorney General’s amended complaint on April 23, 2022. The Company denies the New
30 Table of
Contents Mexico Attorney General’s allegations and maintains that its baby foods are safe, properly labeled, and compliant with New Mexico law. In addition to the consumer class actions discussed above, the Company is currently named in
six
lawsuits in state and federal courts alleging some form of personal injury from the ingestion of the Company’s Products, purportedly due to unsafe and undisclosed levels of various naturally occurring heavy metals. These lawsuits generally allege injuries related to neurological development disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

That said, additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company in the future, asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. Such lawsuits may be resolved in a manner adverse to us, and we may incur substantial costs or damages not covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Other In addition to the litigation described above, the Company is and may be a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business.
With respect to all litigation and related matters, the Company records a liability when the Company believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company has not recorded a liability for any of the matters disclosed in this note. It is possible that some matters could require the Company to pay damages, incur other costs or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of the end of the period covered by this report. 17.     SEGMENT INFORMATION Our organization structure consists of
two
geographic-based reportable segments: North America and International. Our North America reportable segment consists of the United States and Canada as operating segments. Our International reportable segment is comprised of
three
operating segments: United Kingdom, Ella’s Kitchen UK, and Europe. This structure is in line with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, assesses our performance and allocates resources.
We use segment net sales and operating income to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. We believe these measures are most relevant in order to analyze segment results and trends. Segment operating income excludes certain general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), impairment and acquisition related expenses, restructuring, integration, and other charges. 31 Table of

Overview
The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, along with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” and herein referred to as “Hain Celestial,” “we,” “us” and “our”), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 75 countries worldwide. The Company manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells organic and natural products, providing consumers with the opportunity to lead A Healthier Way of Life ® . The Company’s food and beverage brands include Celestial Seasonings ® , Clarks™, Cully & Sully ® , Earth’s Best ® , Ella’s Kitchen ® , Frank Cooper’s ® , Garden of Eatin’ ® , Hartley’s ® , Health Valley ® , Imagine ® , Joya ® , Lima ® , Linda McCartney’s ®

and Yves Veggie Cuisine ® . The Company’s personal care brands include Alba Botanica ® , Avalon Organics ® , JASON ® , Live Clean ®
and Queen Helene ® . Global Economic Environment Economic conditions during fiscal year 2022 and the first half of fiscal year 2023 have been marked by inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and shifts in consumer demand. • Inflation
– The inflationary environment has led to higher costs for ingredients, packaging, energy, transportation and other supply chain components. We expect this higher cost environment to continue, although we expect these higher costs to be partially mitigated by pricing actions we have implemented to date and further pricing actions that we may implement. • Interest Rates
– Loans under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate, and the interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness has increased as market interest rates have risen significantly starting in the second half of fiscal year 2022. These higher interest rates, together with a higher outstanding debt balance, has led to an increase in our interest expense, which we expect to continue. • Consumer Demand
– Recent economic conditions have resulted in changes in consumer spending patterns, which has had an impact on our sales. During an economic downturn, factors such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income and declines in consumer confidence can cause changes in consumer spending behavior, particularly with respect to higher priced better-for-you products. Economic conditions have prompted some consumers, particularly in Europe, to shift to lower-priced products. Supply Chain Disruptions We continue to experience disruption in our supply chain network, including the supply of certain ingredients, packaging, and other sourced materials. These disruptions, in addition to the higher costs described above, have resulted in higher inventory levels. In some cases the disruptions result in an inability to fulfill certain customer orders, which can lead to fines from the customers. Although we believe the unprecedented industry-wide supply chain disruptions are largely behind us, it is possible that additional disruptions to our supply chain could occur. 33 Table of
Contents Russia-Ukraine War Although we have no material assets in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, our supply chain was adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war during the second half of fiscal year 2022 and the first half of fiscal year 2023 and we continue to face other challenges and risks arising from the war. In particular, the war has added significant costs to existing inflationary pressures through increased energy and raw material prices. Further, beyond increased costs, labor challenges and other factors have led to supply chain disruptions. While, to date, we have been able to identify replacement raw materials where necessary, we have incurred increased costs in doing so. The war has also negatively impacted consumer sentiment, particularly in Europe, with some consumers shifting to lower-priced products, which has somewhat affected demand for our products. Additionally, we face increased cybersecurity risks, as companies based in the United States and its allied countries have become targets of malicious cyber activity. While we are continuing to monitor and manage the impacts of the war on our business, the extent to which the Russia-Ukraine war and the related economic impact may affect our financial condition or results of operations in the future remains uncertain. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to contribute to the challenging economic conditions described above, including manufacturing and supply chain challenges, labor market shortages and changing consumer behaviors amid uncertain economic conditions. Acquisition On December 28, 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Proven Brands, Inc. (and its subsidiary That's How We Roll LLC) and KTB Foods Inc., collectively doing business as "That's How We Roll" ("THWR"), the producer and marketer of ParmCrisps ®
and Thinsters ® . See Note 4,
Acquisitions and Dispositions , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Disposition On December 15, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its Westbrae Natural ®
brand ("Westbrae") for total cash consideration of $7,498. The sale of Westbrae is consistent with the Company’s portfolio simplification process, to focus on the brands and categories with the most growth potential. Westbrae operated out of the United States and was part of the Company’s North America reportable segment. CEO Succession On November 22, 2022, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company approved a succession plan pursuant to which Mark L. Schiller transitioned from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of December 31, 2022 (the “Transition Date”). Mr. Schiller remains as a director on the Board following the Transition Date. The Board appointed Wendy P. Davidson to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and as a director on the Board, in each case effective as of January 1, 2023 (the “Start Date”). 34 Table of

On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales decreased approximately $11.5 million, or 2.4%, from the prior year quarter driven by both the North America and International reportable segments. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below in the
Segment Results
section. Gross Profit Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $13.4 million, or 11.5%, as compared to the prior year quarter. Additionally, gross profit margin of 22.9% was lower when compared with 24.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by the International reportable segment mainly resulting from lower net sales in the United Kingdom and Europe operating segments, higher energy and supply chain costs, and under-absorption of overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities when compared to the prior year period. The North America reportable segment had an increase in gross profit mainly driven by pricing increases and cost improvements due to higher productivity, partly offset by inflation and lower net sales in the Canada operating segment when compared with the prior year quarter. 35 Table of
Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.8 million, or 9.7%, from $80.1 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by lower labor-related expenses primarily in Corporate, marketing costs primarily in the North America reportable segment as well as efficiencies gained from the Company's productivity and transformation initiatives.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.7 million from $2.0 million in the prior year quarter due to the acquisition of THWR in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Productivity and Transformation Costs Productivity and transformation costs were $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.8 million from $2.8 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to reduced spending related to productivity and transformation initiatives as the current transformation effort approaches its conclusion. Long-lived Asset Impairment
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million, relating to a facility in the United States. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $0.3 million related to a facility in the United Kingdom. Operating Income Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $27.4 million compared to $32.0 million in the prior year quarter as a result of the items described above.
Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net Interest and other financing expense, net totaled $10.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $8.2 million, or 317.1%, from $2.6 million in the prior year quarter. The increase resulted primarily from rising interest rates and a higher outstanding debt balance driven primarily by the acquisition of THWR in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year as well as share repurchase activity during fiscal 2022. See Note 9,
Debt and Borrowings , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Other Income, Net Other income, net totaled $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $9.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in income was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of assets related to the sale of undeveloped land plots in Boulder, Colorado resulting in a gain of $8.7 million in the prior year quarter. Income Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees Income before income taxes and equity in net loss of our equity-method investees for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $17.6 million compared to $38.5 million in the prior year quarter. T he decrease w as due to the items discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax expense was $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an income tax expense of $7.1 million in the prior year quarter. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 36.0% and 18.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the gain on sale of Westbrae, an
operating lease modification during the second quarter, severance with respect to our former CEO (as part of the limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation) , stock-based compensation and uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by deductions related to stock-based
36 Table of
Contents compensation, non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of THWR and the reversal of a valuation allowance due to the utilization of a capital loss carryover. The effective income tax rates in each period were also impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and state income taxes.
Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees Our equity in net loss from our equity-method investments for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.3 million and $0.5 million in the prior year quarter. See Note 13,
Investments , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Net Income Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $11.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $30.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The change was attributable to the factors noted above. Adjusted EBITDA Our Adjusted EBITDA was $49.8 million and $59.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of the factors discuss ed above, and the adjustments described in the
Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures  presented following the discussion of our results of operations. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6.5 million, or 11.0%, from $59.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $52.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 37 Table of

On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales decreased by 1.9%. In the United States operating segment, adjusted sales were lower compared to the prior year quarter mainly due to retailer inventory adjustments, particularly in tea, and lower sales in personal care, partially offset by higher sales in snacks. Similar trends were noted in the Canada operating segment. Sales were also impacted by the industry-wide formula and pouch supply challenges in the baby food category. Operating income in North America for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $32.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million from $27.2 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was mainly driven by pricing increases, cost improvements due to higher productivity, and lower marketing spend, partially offset by inflation. International
Our net sales in the International reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $171.8 million, a decrease of $30.1 million, or 14.9%, from net sales of $201.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 3.2% from the prior year quarter primarily due to a decline in sales in the Europe operating segments, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Ella's Kitchen UK and United Kingdom operating segments. In the Europe operating segment, net sales were lower due to continued softness in plant-based categories and non-dairy beverages, including the impact of the loss of a large non-dairy co-manufacturing customer in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Operating income in our International reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $11.9 million, a decrease of $15.4 million from operating income of $27.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income was lower in the current quarter when compared to the prior year quarter mainly due to lower gross profit resulting from a decline in sales, higher energy and supply chain costs, and under-absorption of overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities. 38 Table of
Contents Corporate and Other Our Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company’s centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Such Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company’s senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise as well as expenses for certain professional fees, acquisition and divestiture transaction costs, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole.
Our operating loss in Corporate and Other for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $16.8 million, a decrease of $5.7 million, from operating loss of $22.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses mainly on account of lower salaries, wages, and benefits. Refer to Note 17,

Consolidated Results The following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of net sales, on a consolidated basis, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands, other than per share data and percentages, which may not add due to rounding):   Six Months Ended Change in   December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dollars Percentage Net sales $ 893,559  100.0% $ 931,844  100.0% $ (38,285) (4.1)% Cost of sales 695,367  77.8% 709,131  76.1% (13,764) (1.9)% Gross profit 198,192  22.2% 222,713  23.9% (24,521) (11.0)% Selling, general and administrative expenses 147,308  16.5% 153,929  16.5% (6,621) (4.3)% Amortization of acquired intangible assets 5,573  0.6% 4,144  0.4% 1,429  34.5% Productivity and transformation costs 1,759  0.2% 6,769  0.7% (5,010) (74.0)% Long-lived asset impairment 340  —% 303  —% 37  12.2% Operating income 43,212  4.8% 57,568  6.2% (14,356) (24.9)% Interest and other financing expense, net 18,489  2.1% 4,448  0.5% 14,041  315.7% Other income, net (2,852) (0.3)% (9,858) (1.1)% 7,006  (71.1)% Income before income taxes and equity in net loss of equity-method investees 27,575  3.1% 62,978  6.8% (35,403) (56.2)% Provision for income taxes 8,988  1.0% 11,687  1.3% (2,699) (23.1)% Equity in net loss of equity-method investees 698  0.1% 991  0.1% (293) (29.6)% Net income $ 17,889  2.0% $ 50,300  5.4% $ (32,411) (64.4)% Adjusted EBITDA $ 85,846  9.6% $ 106,580  11.4% $ (20,734) (19.5)% Diluted net income per common share $ 0.20  $ 0.52  $ (0.32) (61.5)% 39 Table of
Contents Net Sales Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $893.6 million, a decrease of $38.3 million, or 4.1%, as compared to $931.8 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales decreased approximately $15.3 million, or 1.7%, from the prior comparable period primarily driven by International reportable segment. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below in the
Segment Results
section. Gross Profit Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $198.2 million, a decrease of $24.5 million, or 11.0%, as compared to the prior year comparable period. Gross profit margin was 22.2% of net sales, compared to 23.9% in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by the International reportable segment mainly due to lower net sales in the Europe and United Kingdom operating segments, higher energy and supply chain costs, as well as under absorption of overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities when compared to the prior year period. The North America reportable segment had an increase in gross profit mainly driven by pricing increases and cost improvements driven by higher productivity, partially offset by inflation and lower net sales in the Canada operating segment when compared with the prior year comparable period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $147.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 4.3%, from $153.9 million for the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in Corporate and the International reportable segment. The decrease was driven by lower labor-related expenses primarily in Corporate and lower marketing costs, as well as efficiencies gained from the Company's productivity and transformation initiatives.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangibles was $5.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.4 million from $4.1 million in the prior year comparable period due to the acquisition of THWR in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Productivity and Transformation Costs Productivity and transformation costs were $1.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.0 million from $6.8 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily due to reduced spending related to productivity and transformation initiatives as the current transformation effort approaches its conclusion.
Long-lived Asset Impairment
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million relating to a facility in the United States. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $0.3 million related to a facility in the United Kingdom. Operating Income Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $43.2 million compared to $57.6 million in the prior year comparable period as a result of the items described above.
Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net Interest and other financing expense, net totaled $18.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $14.0 million, or 315.7%, from $4.4 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase resulted primarily from a higher outstanding debt balance driven primarily by the acquisition of THWR in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year as well as share repurchase activity during fiscal 2022. Interest and other financing expense was also impacted by higher interest rates compared to the prior comparable period. See Note 9,
Debt and Borrowings , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
40 Table of
Contents Other Income, Net Other income, net totaled $2.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $9.9 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase in income was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of assets related to the sale of undeveloped land plots in Boulder, Colorado resulting in a gain of $8.7 million in the prior year period. Income from Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees Income before income taxes and equity in net loss of our equity-method investees for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was income of $27.6 million compared to $63.0 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was due to the items discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax expense was $9.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $11.7 million in the prior year comparable period.
The effective income tax rate was an expense of 32.6% and 18.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the gain on sale of Westbrae, an operating lease modification during the second quarter, severance with respect to our former CEO (as part of the limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation), stock-based compensation and uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the reversal of uncertain tax position accruals based on filing of certain elections by taxing authorities, deductions related to stock-based compensation, non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of THWR, and the reversal of a valuation allowance due to the utilization of a capital loss carryover. The effective income tax rates in each period were also impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and state income taxes.
Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees Our equity in net loss from our equity-method investments for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.7 million compared to $1.0 million in the prior year comparable period. See Note 13,
Investments , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Net Income Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $17.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $50.3 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. The change was attributable to the factors noted above. Adjusted EBITDA Our Adjusted EBITDA was $85.8 million and $106.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above, and the adjustments described in the
Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures  presented following the discussion of our results of operations. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15.2 million, or 14.3%, from $106.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $91.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. 41 Table of
Contents Segment Results The following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income by reportable segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
(dollars in thousands) North America International Corporate and Other Consolidated Net sales Six months ended 12/31/22 $ 570,757  $ 322,802  $ —  $ 893,559  Six months ended 12/31/21 540,539  391,305  —  931,844  $ change $ 30,218  $ (68,503) n/a $ (38,285) % change 5.6  % (17.5) % n/a (4.1) % Operating income (loss) Six months ended 12/31/22 $ 56,707  $ 19,615  $ (33,110) $ 43,212  Six months ended 12/31/21 44,004  51,437  (37,873) 57,568  $ change $ 12,703  $ (31,822) $ 4,763  $ (14,356) % change 28.9  % (61.9) % (12.6) % (24.9) % Operating income margin Six months ended 12/31/22 9.9  % 6.1  % n/a 4.8  % Six months ended 12/31/21 8.1  % 13.1  % n/a 6.2  % North America Our net sales in the North America reportable segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $570.8 million, an increase of $30.2 million, or 5.6%, from net sales of $540.5 million in the prior year comparable period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales increased by 0.7% due to increased sales in the United States operating segment due to stronger sales in snacks, partially offset by decreased sales in the Canada operating segment due to lower sales in personal care product categories. Operating income in North America for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $56.7 million, an increase of $12.7 million from $44.0 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase was mainly driven by pricing increases, cost improvements driven by higher productivity, and lower marketing, partly offset by inflation, higher selling, general and administrative costs, and lower net sales in the Canada operating segment when compared with the prior year period. International
Our net sales in the International reportable segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $322.8 million, a decrease of $68.5 million, or 17.5%, from net sales of $391.3 million in the prior year comparable period. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 4.8% from the prior year comparable period mainly due to lower sales in the Europe and United Kingdom operating segments. Operating income in our International reportable segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $19.6 million, a decrease of $31.8 million from operating income of $51.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income was lower in the current period when compared to the prior year comparable period mainly due to lower gross profit resulting from a decline in sales, higher energy and supply chain costs, as well as change in sales mix of high margin products. 42 Table of
Contents Corporate and Other Our Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company’s centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Such Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company’s senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise as well as expenses for certain professional fees, acquisition and divestiture transaction costs, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Our operating expenses in Corporate and Other for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $33.1 million, a decrease of $4.8 million, from $37.9 million in the prior year period. This change was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 17,
Segment Information , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) will be adequate to meet anticipated operating and other expenditures for the foreseeable future. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On December 22, 2021, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facility by entering into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by a First Amendment dated December 16, 2022, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $1,100.0 million in the aggregate, consisting of (1) $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the “Term Loans”) and (2) an $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit, and is comprised of a $440.0 million U.S. revolving credit facility and $360.0 million global revolving credit facility) (the “Revolver”). Both the Revolver and the Term Loans mature on December 22, 2026. The Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated secured leverage ratio. The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is 2.75:1.00. The maximum consolidated leverage ratio is 6.00:1.00. Through December 31, 2023 or such earlier date as elected by the Company (the “Amendment Period”), the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio is 5.00:1.00. Following the Amendment Period, the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio will be 4.25:1.00, subject to possible temporary increase following certain corporate acquisitions. During the Amendment Period, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% (as adjusted, “Term SOFR”) plus 2.0% per annum or (b) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.0% per annum. Following the Amendment Period, loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) Term SOFR plus a rate ranging from 0.875% to 1.750% per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus a rate ranging from 0.00% to 0.750% per annum, the relevant rate in each case being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate following the Amendment Period will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2022 was 5.59%. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the amount unused under the Credit Agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid. As of December 31, 2022, there were
$587.0
million of loans under the Revolver , $292.5 million of Term Loans,
and
$6.8 million
let ters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, $206.2 million was available under the Credit Agreement , subject to compliance with the financial covenants, as compared to $204.0 million as of June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all associated covenants. In addition to obligations under the Credit Agreement, we are party to other contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including purchase commitments and lease obligations, which impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. See Note 7, Leases. Our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $22.1 million at December 31, 2022 to $43.4 million as compared to $65.5 million at June 30, 2022. Our working capital was $357.4 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $28.4 million from
43 Table of
Contents $329.0 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Additionally, our total debt decreased by $10.2 million at December 31, 2022 to $878.4 million as compared to $888.6 million at June 30, 2022 as a result of $9.8 million of net repayments carried out during the period.
Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and India. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the total cash balance from operations was held outside of the United States. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. As of December 31, 2022, all of our investments were expected to mature in less than three months. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash (used in) provided by operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below.
Six Months Ended December 31, Change in
(amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Dollars Cash flows (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (2,652) $ 68,031  $ (70,683) Investing activities (6,014) (272,345) 266,331  Financing activities (10,892) 208,849  (219,741) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,517) (3,204) 687  Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (22,075) $ 1,331  $ (23,406) Cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $70.7 million from cash provided by operating activities of $68.0 million in the prior year period. This decrease versus the prior period resulted primarily from a reduction of $25.5 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges in the current period and lower cash generation of $45.2 million from our working capital accounts primarily due to higher inventory balances as a result of inflation, and a higher account receivable balance due to timing of cash receipts. Cash used in investing activities was $6.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $266.3 million from $272.3 million in the prior year period primarily due to the acquisition of THWR in the same period of the prior year. Cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease in cash provided of $219.7 million compared to $208.8 million of cash provided in the prior year period. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher borrowings under the Credit Agreement to finance the THWR acquisition, higher share repurchases, and payment of shares withheld for employee payroll taxes during the same period in the prior year. Operating Free Cash Flows Operating free cash flows were negative $16.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $56.7 million from $40.0 million provided by operating free cash flows in the six months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease versus prior year resulted primarily from a decrease in cash flow from operations of $70.7 million driven by the reasons explained above. See the  Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures  following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities to operating free cash flows. Share Repurchase Program In January 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans, in private transactions or otherwise. The current 2022 authorization does not have a stated expiration date. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
$173.5 million
of remaining authorization under the share repurchase program.
44 Table of
Contents Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.
For each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believe the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors use the non-U.S. GAAP measures. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
Net Sales - Constant Currency Presentation
We believe that net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Net Sales - Adjusted for the Impact of Acquisitions, Divestitures and Discontinued Brands We also exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands when comparing net sales to prior periods, which results in the presentation of certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands when presenting period-over-period results of net sales aids in comparability. To present net sales adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, the net sales of an acquired business are excluded from fiscal quarters constituting or falling within the current period and prior period where the applicable fiscal quarter in the prior period did not include the acquired business for the entire quarter. To present net sales adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, the net sales of a divested business or discontinued brand are excluded from all periods. A reconciliation between reported net sales and net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands is as follows: 45 Table of

The Company’s management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the Company and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 46 Table of
Contents We do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA.

Expenses and items relating to securities class action and baby food litigation. Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency Presentation
The Company provides Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis because the Company’s management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of performance-based executive compensation. The Company believes presenting Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-to-period comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. 47 Table of
Contents A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and constant currency Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: (amounts in thousands) Hain Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA - Three months ended December 31, 2022 $ 49,817  Impact of foreign currency exchange 2,909  Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis - Three months ended December 31, 2022 $ 52,726  Adjusted EBITDA - Three months ended December 31, 2021 $ 59,264  A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and constant currency Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: (amounts in thousands) Hain Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA - Six months ended December 31, 2022 $ 85,846  Impact of foreign currency exchange 5,527  Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis - Six months ended December 31, 2022 $ 91,373  Adjusted EBITDA - Six months ended December 31, 2021 $ 106,580  Operating Free Cash Flows In our internal evaluations, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “Operating Free Cash Flows” The difference between Operating Free Cash Flows and cash flow provided by or used in operating activities, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that Operating Free Cash Flows reflects the impact of purchases of property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash provided by or used in operating activities. We view Operating Free Cash Flows as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider Operating Free Cash Flows in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
A reconciliation from cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities to Operating Free Cash Flows is as follows:
Six Months Ended December 31, (amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (2,652) $ 68,031  Purchases of property, plant and equipment (14,055) (27,996) Operating free cash flows $ (16,707) $ 40,035  48 Table of
Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies; however, materially different amounts may be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have applied. The accounting policies that have been identified as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of our operations pertain to variable consideration, valuation of accounts and chargeback receivable, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The application of each of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Part II, Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ,
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 from which there have been no material changes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2,  Basis of Presentation , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Seasonality Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters. Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no significant changes in market risk from those addressed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 during the six months ended December 31, 2022. See the information set forth in Part II, Item 7A,

Contents Item 4.        Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), with the assistance of other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this review, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures for the Company were effective as of December 31, 2022. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement. An evaluation of effectiveness is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may decrease over time. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 50 Table of
