NATURALSHRIMP
INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR
THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
NOTE
1 –
NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Nature
of the Business
NaturalShrimp
Incorporated (“NaturalShrimp” or the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, is a biotechnology company and has developed
a proprietary technology that allows it to grow Pacific White shrimp (Lit Penaeus, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled,
high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. The Company’s system uses technology
which allows it to produce a naturally grown shrimp “crop” weekly and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or
toxic chemicals. The Company has developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows it to produce
commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors and maintains proper levels
of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production. The Company’s production facilities are located in La Coste,
Texas and Webster City, Iowa.
On
December 17, 2020, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) between VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(“VBF”), VBF Transport, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Transport”), and Iowa’s First, Inc., an Iowa corporation
(“Iowa’s First”) (each a “Seller” and collectively, “Sellers”). Transport and Iowa’s
First were wholly-owned subsidiaries of VBF. The agreement called for the Company to purchase all of the tangible assets of VBF, the
motor vehicles of Transport and the real property (together with all plants, buildings, structures, fixtures, fittings, systems and other
improvements located on such real property) of Iowa’s First. The facility was originally designed as an aquaculture facility, with
the company having production issues. The Company began a modification process to convert the plant to produce shrimp, which will allow
them to scale faster without having to build new facilities. The three Iowa facilities contain the tanks and infrastructure that will
be used to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s patented EC platform technology.
On
May 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with F&T Water Solutions, LLC (“F&T”),
for F&T’s owned shares of Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (“NAS”). Prior to entering into the SPA, the Company owned
fifty-one percent ( 51 %) and F&T owned forty-nine percent ( 49 %) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NAS. After
the SPA, NAS is a
100 % owned subsidiary of the Company.
The
Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries including NaturalShrimp USA Corporation, NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. and NAS.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company had a net loss from operations of approximately $ 8,609,000 .
At December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 163,038,000
and a working capital deficit of approximately
$ 8,191,000 .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year from the issuance
date of this filing. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the required additional
capital or debt financing to meet short and long-term operating requirements. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
received the $ 1,500,000
remaining escrow amount related to the proceeds from the issuance
of a convertible debenture in December 2021, as well as $ 1,465,000
from the issuance of a convertible debenture
in August 2022, per the restructuring agreement and $ 250,000
in a loan agreement with related parties. Additionally,
the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with GHS Investments LLC (“GHS”) under which the Company may require GHS to
purchase a maximum of up to
64,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock (“GHS
Purchase Shares”) based on a total aggregate purchase price of up to $ 5,000,000
over a one-year term that ends on November 4, 2023
(see Note 11). During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a net amount of approximately $ 1,380,000 ,
for the sale of
17,175,675
shares of common stock. Subsequent to the period
end, the Company has received another $ 878,365
from GHS for the sale of
14,880,460
shares
of common stock. Management believes that private placements of equity capital will be needed to fund the Company’s long-term operating
requirements. The Company may also encounter business endeavors that require significant cash commitments or unanticipated problems or
expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity,
the percentage ownership of its current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our operations. The Company continues to pursue external financing alternatives to
improve its working capital position. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may be unable to develop
its facilities and enter in production.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited financial information as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 has been prepared
in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, such financial information includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position at such date and the operating results and cash flows
for such periods. Operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the entire year or for any other subsequent interim period.
Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant
to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. These unaudited financial statements and related notes should
be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022.
The
condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Consolidation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NaturalShrimp Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
NaturalShrimp USA Corporation, NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. and Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
Preparing
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
8
Basic
and Diluted Earnings/Loss per Common Share
Basic
and diluted earnings or loss per share (“EPS”) amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are computed
in accordance with ASC 260 – 10 “ Earnings per Share ”, which establishes the requirements for presenting EPS.
Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss
available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (denominator) during
the period. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had
5,000,000
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
which would be converted at the holder’s option into approximately
751,385,000
underlying common shares,
170
shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred
shares whose approximately
2,775,000
underlying shares are convertible at the investors’
option at conversion price of
90 %
of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days,
750,000
shares of Series F Preferred Stock which would
be converted at the holders’ option into approximately
180,333,000
underlying common shares, whose shares were included
in the calculation of diluted EPS. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had
1,500
shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred
shares whose approximately
5,143,000
underlying shares are convertible at the investors’
option at a fixed conversion price of $ 0.35 ,
and
18,573,116
warrants
outstanding which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive as their conversion and
exercise prices were greater than the market price of the Company’s common shares. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company had
5,000,000
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
which would be converted at the holder’s option into approximately
768,561,000
underlying common shares,
1,500
shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred
shares whose approximately
5,143,000
underlying shares are convertible at the investors’
option at a fixed conversion price of $ 0.35 ,
and
170
shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred
shares whose approximately
2,775,000
underlying shares are convertible at the investors’
option at conversion price of
90 %
of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days,
750,000
shares of Series F Preferred Stock which would
be converted at the holders’ option into approximately
184,387,000
underlying common shares, and
18,573,116
warrants outstanding which were not included
in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the
Company had Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock with approximately
9,842,000
underlying common shares, $ 18,768,000
in a convertible debenture whose approximately
67,816,000
underlying shares are convertible at the holders’
option at conversion price of
90 %
of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days and
18,506,429
warrants outstanding which were not included
in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Fair
Value Measurements
ASC
Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurement” , requires that certain financial instruments be recognized at their fair values
at our balance sheet dates. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their
fair values, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair
values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our balance
sheets. For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument,
along with other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive
income. For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under
“Financial
Instruments.”
Nonfinancial
assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in the Company’s
balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires
the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of
property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability
along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred.
The
Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
The
derivative and warrant liabilities are Level 3 fair value measurements.

and there is no longer an embedded derivative to be bifurcated (Note 6).
At
March 31, 2022, the fair value of the derivative liabilities of convertible notes was estimated using the following inputs: the price
of the Company’s common stock of $ 0.225 ; the conversion price of $ 0.19 ; a risk-free interest rate of

On
November 4, 2022, when the Company entered into a Restructuring Agreement for an Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note for two
of their outstanding debentures (Note 6 and Note 7), which were accounted for as debt extinguishment, the Company elected to recognize
the new debt under ASC 825 fair value option .
Financial
Instruments
The
Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt and are accounted for under
the provisions of ASC Topic 825, “ Financial Instruments” . The carrying amount of these financial instruments, with
the exception of discounted debt, as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.
10
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
the purpose of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
The
Company maintains cash balances at two financial institutions. Accounts at this institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) up to $ 250,000 .
As of
December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash balance
did not exceed FDIC coverage. As of
March 31, 2022, the Company’s cash balance exceeded FDIC
coverage.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and periodically evaluates the credit worthiness of the
financial institutions and has determined the credit exposure to be negligible.
Fixed
Assets
Equipment
is carried at historical value or cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment, the cost and accumulated
depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718. “ Stock-based Compensation
to Employees ” is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite
employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for
common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Company’s common stock for common share issuances. Once the stock
is issued the appropriate expense account is charged.
Intangible
Assets
The
Company has intangible assets, which were acquired in a patent acquisition, and license rights agreements. The Company’s patents
represent definite lived intangible assets and will be amortized over the twenty-year duration of the patent, unless at some point the
useful life is determined to be less than the protected life of the patent. The Company’s license rights will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected term of the agreements of ten years. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the
amortization of the patents was $ 97,500
and $ 292,500
and the license rights was $ 270,000
and $ 810,000 .
Amortization
expense for the patents was $ 97,500
and $ 244,000
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The accumulated amortization
of the patents was $ 633,500,000
and $ 341,500
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The accumulated amortization of
the license rights was $ 1,350,000
and $ 540,000
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
The
Company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes the carrying value of the intangible
assets are still recoverable, and there is no impairment to be recognized.
11
Impairment
of Long-lived Assets
The
Company will periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant
such a review and at least annually. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted
cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in
a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose.
Commitments
and Contingencies
Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss
to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management
and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing
loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings,
the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable
but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
and material, would be disclosed.
Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee
would be disclosed.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
and as such, the Company records revenue when its customers obtain control of the promised goods or services in an amount that
reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company will sell
primarily to food service distributors, as well as to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.
To
determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company
performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer by receipt of purchase orders and confirmations sent
by the Company, which includes a required line of credit approval process, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract,
which includes shipment of goods to the customer FOB shipping point or destination, (3) determine the transaction price, which
initiates with the purchase order received from the customer and confirmation sent by the Company and will include discounts and
allowances by customer if any, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract which is the
shipment of the goods to the customer and transaction price determined in step 3 above and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the
Company satisfies a performance obligation which is when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customers by shipment or
delivery of the products.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2020-06, “ Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments
and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity ” (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and
convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires
entities to account for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt
or preferred stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and
embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain
criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, “ Earnings Per Share ”, to require
entities to calculate diluted EPS for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities must presume share
settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding smaller
reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities,
ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities
should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
As
of December 31, 2022, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these
pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting
pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Management’s
Evaluation of Subsequent Events
The
Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2022, through the date which the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements were issued. Based upon the review, other than described in Note 11 – Subsequent Events, the
Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

On
July 3, 2022, the Company’s building containing its water treatment and purification system in La Coste, Texas (the “Water
Treatment Plant”) was completely destroyed in a fire. The Water Treatment Plant is a separate building consisting of approximately
8,000
square feet located apart from the production building which was not damaged. The Company received $ 700,000
from the insurance
company for the claim filed for the fire damage. Due to the damage caused by the fire, the Company has written off approximately $ 1,764,000
of the fixed assets, and $ 325,000
of the accumulated depreciation, which, less the $ 700,000
insurance settlement, has resulted in the
recognition of a Loss due to fire in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE

PROMISSORY NOTE
The
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with an investor (the “Investor”) on August
17, 2022. Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor purchased a secured promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount
totaling approximately $ 5,433,333 . The Note has an interest rate of
12 % per annum, with a maturity date nine months from the issuance
date of the Note. The Note carried an original issue discount totaling $ 433,333
and a transaction expense amount of $ 10,000 , both of
which are included in the principal balance of the Note. On the Closing Date the Company received $ 1,100,000 , with $ 3,900,000
put into
escrow to be held until certain terms are met, which includes $ 3,400,000
upon the completion of a successful uplist to NYSE or NASDAQ.
The SPA includes a Security Agreement, whereby the note is secured by the collateral set forth in the agreement, covering all of the
assets of the Company. All payments made by the Company under the terms in the note, including upon repayment of this Note at maturity,
shall be subject to an exit fee of
15 % of the portion of the Outstanding Balance being paid (the “Exit Fee”). As the Exit
Fee is to be included in every settlement of the Note, an additional
15 % of the principal balance, which totals $ 816,500 , was recognized
along with the principal balance, and offset by a contra account in a manner similar to a debt discount.
As
soon as reasonably possible, the Company will cause the Common Stock to be listed for trading on either of (a) NYSE, or (b) NASDAQ (in
either event, an “Uplist”). In the event the Company has not effectuated the Uplist by November 15, 2022, the then-current
outstanding balance will be increased by
10 %.
Following the Uplist, while the Note is still outstanding, ten days after the Company may
have a sale of any of its shares of common stock or preferred stock, there shall be a Mandatory Prepayment equal to the greater of $ 3,000,000
or thirty-three percent of the gross proceeds of the equity sale .
In
conjunction with the Merger Agreement, entered into on October 24, 2022, with Yotta Acquisition Corporation (Note 10), on November 4,
2022, the Company entered into a Restructuring Agreement for an Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “August Note”),
through which the August Note was amended and restated in its entirety. The Restructuring Agreement included key modifications, in which
i) the Uplist terms were removed, ii) in the event that the Closing of the Merger does not occur on or before December 31, 2022, the
then-current Outstanding Balance will be increased by 2% and shall increase by 2% every 30 days thereafter until the Closing or termination
of the Merger Agreement, and iii) the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note may be increased by 5% to 15% upon the occurrence of
an event of default or failure to obtain the Lender’s consent or notify the Lender for certain major equity related transactions
(“Trigger Events”). The Merger has not yet closed, and therefore the 2% of the outstanding balance was increased as of December
31, 202 2, in the amount of approximately $ 35,000 .
The
Restructured August Note was analyzed under ASC 470-50 as to if the change in terms qualified as a modification or an extinguishment
of the note. The changes in terms were considered an extinguishment as the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new
debt instrument was evaluated to be a substantial change, as over
10 % difference from the present value of the remaining cash flows under
the terms of the original instrument. As such, with the removal of the original note and its debt discount and accrued interest as compared
to the restructured note with a fair value of approximately $ 1,933,000 , there was a loss in extinguishment of approximately $ 157,000 .
As a result of the extinguishment and at the Company’s election of the fair value option under ASC 825, the August Note will be
accounted for at fair value until they are settled. In accordance with ASC 815- 15-25-1(b) a hybrid instrument that is measured at fair
value under ASC 825 fair value option each period with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur should not be evaluated
for embedded derivatives. Therefore, the provisions in the August Note were not evaluated as to if they fell under the guidance of embedded
derivatives and were required to be bifurcated. The August Note was revalued as of December 31, 2022 at approximately $ 2,219,000 , with
a change in fair value of approximately $ 286,000

CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
December
15, 2021 Debenture
The
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “December 2021 SPA”) with an investor (the “December 2021
Investor”) on December 15, 2021. Pursuant to the December 2021 SPA, the December 2021 Investor purchased a secured promissory note
(the “December 2021 Note”) in the aggregate principal amount totaling approximately $ 16,320,000 . The December 2021 Note has
an interest rate of
12 % per annum, with a maturity date 24 months from the issuance date of the December 2021 Note (the “Maturity
Date”). The December 2021 Note carried an original issue discount totaling $ 1,300,000
and a transaction expense amount of $ 20,000 ,
both of which are included in the principal balance of the December 2021 Note. The December 2021 Note had $ 2,035,000
in debt issuance
costs, including fees paid in cash of $ 1,095,000
and
3,000,000
warrants issued to placement agents with a fair value of $ 940.000 . The
warrant fair value was estimated using the Black Scholes Model, with the following inputs: the price of the Company’s common stock
of $ 0.32 ; a risk-free interest rate of
1.19 %, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock of
209.9 %; the estimated remaining
term, a dividend rate of
0 %. The warrants were classified as a liability, as it is not known if there will be sufficient authorized shares
to be issued upon settlement, based on the conversion terms of the convertible debt.
Beginning
on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date of the December 2021 Note, the December 2021 Investor has the right to redeem up
to $ 1,000,000
of the outstanding balance per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash,
or (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share (the “Common
Stock”), per the following formula: the number of redemption shares equals the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided
by the Redemption Repayment Price.
The “Redemption Repayment Price” equals 90% multiplied by the average of the two lowest
volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date that the
December 2021 Investor delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the December 2021 Note. The redemption amount shall include a
premium of 15% of the portion of the outstanding balance being paid (the “Exit Fee”). As the Exit Fee is to be included in
every settlement of the December 2021 Note, an additional 15% of the principal balance, which totals $ 2,448,000 , was recognized along
with the principal balance, and offset by a contra account in a manner similar to a debt discount. In addition to the December 2021 Investor’s
right of redemption, the Company has the option to prepay the December 2021 Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date by paying a
premium of 15% plus the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date.
Within
180 days of the issuance date of the December 2021 Note, the Company will obtain an effective registration statement or a supplement
to any existing registration statement or prospectus with the SEC registering at least $ 15,000,000
in shares of Common Stock for the
December 2021 Investor’s benefit such that any redemption using shares of Common Stock could be done using registered Common Stock.
Additionally, as soon as reasonably possible following the issuance of the December 2021 Note, the Company will cause the Common Stock
to be listed for trading on either of (a) NYSE, or (b) NASDAQ (in either event, an “Uplist”). In the event the Company has
not effectuated the Uplist by March 1, 2022, the then-current outstanding balance will be increased by 10%. On February 7, 2022, the
Company and the December 2021 Investor entered into an amendment to the December 2021 SPA, which extended the date by which the Uplist
must be completed to April 15, 2022. In consideration of the grant of the extension there was an extension fee of $ 249,079
added to the
principal balance, which has been recognized as a financing cost in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement.
Subsequently, the date by which the Uplist had to be completed was further extended to June 15, 2022, and again to November 15, 2022,
with no additional fee included. The Company will make a one-time payment to the December 2021 Investor equal to 15% of the gross proceeds
the Company receives from the offering expected to be effected in connection with the Uplist (whether from the sale of shares of its
Common Stock and / or preferred stock) within ten (10) days of receiving such amount. In the event the Company does not make this payment,
the then-current outstanding balance will be increased by 10%. In addition, the Company has 30 days in which to secure the December 2021
Note and grant the December 2021 Investor a first position security interest in the real property in Texas and Iowa, and if it is not
effectuated within the 30 days the outstanding balance will be increased by 15%.
The Company is required to reserve
65,000,000
shares
of common stock from its authorized and unissued common stock and to add
100,000,000
shares of common stock to the Share Reserve on or
before March 10, 2022.
15
The
December 2021 Note also contains certain negative covenants and Events of Default, which in addition to common events of default, include
a failure to deliver conversion shares, the Company fails to maintain the share reserve, the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction
without the December 2021 Investor’s written consent, the Company effectuates a reverse split of its common stock without 20 trading
days written notice to the December 2021 Investor, fails to observe or perform or breaches any covenant, and, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, breaches any covenant or other term or condition contained in any Other Agreements in any material. Upon an Event of a
Default, at its option and sole discretion, the December 2021 Investor may consider the December 2021 Note immediately due and payable.
Upon such an Event of Default, the interest rate increases to 18% per annum and the outstanding balance of the December 2021 Note increases
from 5% to 15%, depending upon the specific Event of Default . As of December 31, 2022, the Company is in full compliance with the covenants
and Events of Default.
The
conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative and therefore requires bifurcation and was accounted for as a derivative liability.
As of December 31, 2022 the fair value of the derivative is $ 30,028,000 , with a change in fair value of $ 16,927,000
recognized in the
nine months ended December 31, 2022.
On
November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Restructuring Agreement for an Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “Senior
Note”) with the December 2021 Investor through which the December 2021 Note was amended and restated in its entirety. These amendments
were made in conjunction with the Merger Agreement, entered into on October 24, 2022, with Yotta Acquisition Corporation (Note 10), The
main modification of the terms of the Senior Note was that the conversion feature was eliminated. Second, a Mandatory Payment was added
whereby within 3 trading days of the closing upon the Merger an amount equal to the lesser of (A) one-third of the amount retained in
the Trust Account at the Effective Time or (B) $ 10,000,000 , in order to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the Convertible
Note; after which the remaining balance of the Convertible Note is to be repaid in equal monthly installments over a 12-month period
beginning on a date after the Closing Date or the termination of such agreement.
Additionally, if the Closing Date is after December
31, 2022, the outstanding balance of all indebtedness owed by the Company to December 2021 Investor will be increased automatically by
2% and will automatically increase by 2% every 30 days thereafter until the Closing, or substantially similar terms as approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company. Additional key modifications include i) the Uplist terms were removed, ii) Maturity date was modified
from December 15, 2023 to December 4, 2023, and iii) the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note may be increased by 5% to 15% upon
the occurrence of an event of default or failure to obtain the Lender’s consent or notify the Lender for certain major equity related
transactions (“Trigger Events”). As of December 31, 2022, the Merger has not yet closed, and therefore the 2% of the outstanding
balance was increased as of December 31, 2022 , in the amount of approximately $ 1,309,000 .
The
Restructured Senior Note was analyzed under ASC 470-50 as to if the change in terms qualified as a modification or an extinguishment
of the note. The changes in terms were considered an extinguishment as the conversion feature has been eliminated and therefore the modified
August Note is determined to be fundamentally different from the original convertible note. As such, with the removal of the original
note and its debt discount and accrued interest as compared to the restructured note with a fair value of approximately $ 18,914,000 ,
there was a gain in extinguishment of approximately $ 2,540,000 . As a result of the extinguishment and at the Company’s election
of the fair value option under ASC 825, the Senior Note will be accounted for at fair value until it is settled. In accordance with ASC
815- 15-25-1(b) a hybrid instrument that is measured at fair value under ASC 825 fair value option each period with changes in fair value
reported in earnings as they occur should not be evaluated for embedded derivatives. Therefore, the provisions in the Senior Note were
not evaluated as to if they fell under the guidance of embedded derivatives and were required to be bifurcated. The Senior Note was revalued
as of December 31, 2022 at approximately $ 20,223,000 , with a change in fair value of approximately $ 1,309,000
recognized in the Statement
of Operations.

Series
E Preferred Stock
On
June 16, 2022, one of the holders of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock chose to exercise their right, pursuant to the Certificate
of Designation relating to the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, to receive the rights extended to the convertible noteholder, of
90% multiplied by the average of the two lowest volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading
days immediately preceding the date of conversion. As the exercise of the conversion price adjustment was similar to a down round, and
the Company has not yet adopted ASU 2020-06, the accounting treatment of ASU 2017-11 was applied, whereby the adjustment was treated
as a contingent beneficial conversion feature recognized as of the triggering date. As of June 16, 2022, this holder held 940 shares
of the Series E preferred stock. The Company analyzed the conversion feature under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other
options”, and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company as compared to the conversion price, determined there
was a $ 99,000
beneficial conversion feature to recognize, which was fully amortized as there is no remaining redemption date to their
Series E Preferred Stock. The additional rights of the convertible note which were applied include the
10 % increase in the outstanding
balance if an uplist to a national exchange was not consummated by the Company by March 1, 2022, for an increase of
130
Series E Preferred
shares with a stated value of $ 156,000 , as well as an exit fee of
15 % to be recognized upon conversions of the Series E Preferred shares
into shares of common stock.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
1,300
shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into
14,458,127
shares of common stock.
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of the Series E preferred stock
was approximately $ 28,000
and $ 113,000 , and the Series E beneficial conversion feature was fully amortized. The Company is accreting
the carrying value, of the Series E Preferred Stock in temporary equity up to the redemption value over the period until its redemption.
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $ 198,000
and $ 755,000
was accreted, and $ 1,114,000
was fully amortized
to date as of December 31, 2022.
On
November 5, 2022, the Company entered a restructuring agreement with GHS, whereby the Series E Preferred Stock and the warrants outstanding
( 13,739,000
warrants of the warrants discussed below) as of the Closing date shall have their terms adjusted. The outstanding warrants
shall be a) cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the fair value of the warrants based on the Black Scholes model, with the
exercise price to be adjusted to equal
80 % of the average volume weighted average price of the Company common stock during the five trading
day period immediately prior to the Closing Date (the “Adjusted Exercise Price”); or (b) as of the Effective Time, canceled
and treated as if exercised for that number of shares of the Company’s common stock calculated using the Black Scholes model fair
value, the number of Warrant Shares on the Closing Date and the Adjusted Exercise Price, with the shares of the Company’s common
stock that would have been due to Holder as a result of such exercise of the Warrant treated as if issued to Holder and then converted
into the right to receive (i) the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) plus (ii) the Additional
Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement), if any, at the time and subject to the contingencies set forth in
the Merger Agreement. For the Series E Preferred Stock that shall be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, they shall
be canceled and treated as if converted into that number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to (i)
the stated value
of $1,200 per share plus any unpaid dividends, multiplied by 1.25, divided by (ii) 80% of the average volume weighted average price of
the Company’s common stock during the five trading day period immediately prior to the Closing Date.
The shares of the Company’s
common stock that would have been due to the holder as a result of the conversion of such shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock
shall be treated as issued to holder and converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive (y) the Closing Per Share Merger
Consideration plus (z) the Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, if any, at the time and subject to the contingencies set forth

LEASES
On
May 26, 2021, the Company entered into a sublease for a new office space in Texas, on two floors. The lease commenced on August 1, 2021
for a monthly rent of $ 7,000 , and will terminate on
October 31, 2025 , for one of the spaces, and commence in the second half of 2022
for monthly rent of $ 1,727 , and terminate on
October 31, 2025 , for the second space. On June 2, 2021, the Company paid a deposit of $ 52,362
which shall be applied to the last nine months of the sublease term, and $ 17,454
security deposit, which is included in Prepaid expenses
on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company assessed its new office lease as an operating lease.
At
inception, on August 1, 2021, the ROU and lease liability was calculated as approximately $ 316,000 , based on the net present value of
the future lease payments over the term of the lease. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease discount payments
as the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the net present value; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable
for their corporate office lease. In this case, the Company estimated its incremental borrowing rate of
5.75 % as the interest rate it
could have incurred to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment on a collateralized basis over
a term similar to the lease term. The Company estimated its rate based on observable risk-free interest rate and credit spreads for commercial
debt of a similar duration as to what rate would have been effective for the Company.
On
September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an equipment lease agreement for VOIP phone equipment. The lease term is for sixty months,
with a monthly lease payment of approximately $ 300 . The Company assessed the equipment lease as an operating lease. The Company determined
the Right of Use asset and Lease liability values at inception as approximately $ 17,000
calculated at the present value of all future
lease payments for the lease term, using an incremental borrowing rate of
5.75 %.

into the right to receive its allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares
(to the extent the required revenue thresholds are met).
Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement and agreements that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will enter into with holders
of such convertible securities, such convertible securities will be canceled prior to the closing of the Merger in exchange (except for
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $ 0.0001
per share (the “Series A Preferred”) for a cash
payment or Yotta Shares as follows: (i) at the option of the holder thereof, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock
will be canceled in exchange for a cash payment based on the value thereof or treated as exercised for shares of Common Stock, in each
case based on an adjusted exercise price and as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement and/or the individual agreements, and if
treated as exercised, converted into the right to receive such deemed shares of Common Stock’s allocable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares; (ii) each outstanding share of Series F Convertible Preferred
Stock of the Company, par value $ 0.0001
per share, will be canceled and treated as if converted into shares of Common Stock at an adjusted
conversion rate as set forth in the Merger Agreement and/or such individual agreements, and converted into the right to receive such
deemed shares of Common Stock’s allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration
Shares; and (iii) each outstanding share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $ 0.0001
per share (the “Series
E Preferred”), will be canceled and treated as if converted into shares of Common Stock at an adjusted conversion rate as set forth
in the Merger Agreement and/or such individual agreements, and converted into the right to receive such deemed shares of Common Stock’s
allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares. In addition, each holder
of Series E Preferred will be entitled to receive at the Effective Time an additional number of Closing Merger Consideration Shares as
are necessary to ensure that the per-share value of the Yotta Shares that such stockholder is entitled to receive is not less than the
per-share value (based on the effective purchase price) of the aggregate Yotta Shares then held by any Yotta stockholder after taking
into account any newly-issued Yotta Shares that such Yotta stockholder acquires directly from Yotta prior to the closing of the Merger
(the “Closing”) (which will reduce the number of Closing Merger Consideration Shares that will be issued to the Company’s
other securities holders). The Series A Preferred will be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and for no consideration.
As
noted in Notes 5 and 6, the Company entered into Restructuring Agreements with the December 2021 Investor as required in the Merger Agreement.
21
The
Business Combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization of NaturalShrimp into Yotta in accordance
with GAAP because NaturalShrimp has been determined to be the accounting acquirer under ASC 805 under the no-redemption and full redemption
scenarios. Under this method of accounting, Yotta will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes.
Accordingly, the combined assets, liabilities and results of operations of NaturalShrimp will become the historical financial statements
of NaturalShrimp Incorporated, and Yotta’s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with NaturalShrimp
beginning on the acquisition date. For accounting purposes, the financial statements of NaturalShrimp Incorporated will represent a continuation
of the financial statements of NaturalShrimp with the transaction being treated as the equivalent of NaturalShrimp issuing stock for
the net assets of Yotta, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Yotta will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill
or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination will be presented as those of NaturalShrimp in future
reports of NaturalShrimp Incorporated.

23
As
used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,”
and “our” refer to NaturalShrimp Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: NaturalShrimp USA Corporation (“NSC”)
and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. (“NS Global”) and Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (“NAS”). Unless otherwise specified,
all dollar amounts are expressed in United States Dollars.
Corporate
History
The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name “Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.” On January
30, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“NSH”), that
had developed the proprietary technology to grow and sell shrimp potentially anywhere in the world that is now the basis of our business.
Such assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiaries NaturalShrimp USA Corporation
(“NSC”) and NaturalShrimp Global (“NS Global”), and certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas,
in exchange for our issuance of 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSC. As a result of the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of
our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we changed our principal
business to a global shrimp farming company. We changed our name to “NaturalShrimp Incorporated” in 2015.
Business
Overview
We
are a biotechnology company and have developed proprietary platform technologies that allow us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus
vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent
production facilities. Our system uses technology that allows us to produce a naturally grown shrimp “crop” weekly without
the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows
us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors, and maintains
proper levels of oxygen, salinity, and temperature for optimal shrimp production. The Company’s production facilities are located
in La Coste, Texas and Webster City, Iowa.
On
December 17, 2020, we acquired certain assets from VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. and its subsidiaries VBF Transport, Inc. and Iowa’s
First, Inc., including a facility that was designed for the growth of barramundi fish that we are in the process of converting so that
it can produce shrimp using the Company’s propriety technology. The consideration for the purchase of these assets was (i) $10,000,000,
consisting of (i) $5,000,000 in cash paid at closing, (ii) $3,000,000 payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per
annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid as a balloon payment on
the maturity date, and (iii) $2,000,000 payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable
quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date. The Company
also issued 500,000 shares of common stock as a finder’s fee in connection with the transaction.
The
facility was originally designed as an aquaculture facility. The Company has begun a modification process to convert the plant to produce
shrimp, which will allow us to scale faster without having to build new facilities. The Iowa facility contains the tanks and infrastructure
that the Company will use to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s electrocoagulation platform
technology. The Company also plans to convert additional square footage currently used as storage to its planned shrimp processing plant.
The development of the facility is 40% completed with full development of the facility expected by December 31, 2022.
On
May 25, 2021, the Company purchased from F&T Water Solutions LLC (“F&T”) its 50% ownership interest in a water treatment
technology used or useful in growing aquatic species in re-circulating and enclosed environments that the Company and F&T had previously
jointly developed and patented (the “Patent”), as well as F&T’s 100% interest in a second patent associated with
the Patent issued to F&T in March 2018 and all other intellectual property rights owned by F&T for a purchase price of $2,000,000
in cash and 9,900,990 shares of the Company’s common stock.
24
The
Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: NSC, NS Global, and NAS.
Evolution
of Technology
In
2001, we began research and development of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide
quality, fresh shrimp every week, 52 weeks a year. Our initial system was successful, but we determined that it would not be economically
feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from developing the first system, we
developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have produced thousands of
pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large
size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before
selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment
to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment.
Production
and Sales
On
July 3, 2022, the La Coste, Texas shrimp production facility experienced a fire that damaged the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) including
the filtration equipment within the building. The initial investigation indicated that the fire started at an external source near the
WTP building. No one was hurt and this did not cause any damage to the main production building containing the shrimp. The Company immediately
engaged its Emergency Response Team comprised of management, engineering, production, and sales personnel organized to quickly respond
and deal with potential situations such as this. Fortunately, the Company has the necessary backup equipment to replace the damaged equipment
which will allow continued production and sales in Texas. The Company received $700,000 from the insurance company for the claim filed
for the fire damage. Due to the damage caused by the fire, the Company has written off approximately $1,764,000 of the fixed assets,
and $325,000 of the accumulated depreciation, which, less the $700,000 insurance settlement, has resulted in the recognition of a loss
due to fire in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Texas
began selling live shrimp in late June, and Iowa has been selling since November of 2021. The initial live shrimp sales were limited
in size to establish and train customers in shipping and handling procedures. These sales are targeted presently in the Chicago and San
Antonio areas. As previously announced, the Company has established a partnership with US Foods, a leading foodservice distributor, to
deliver the Company’s fresh never frozen shrimp to US Foods in the South Texas area. The Company expects sales to begin in November
2022 with sales of approximately 1,000 pounds per month with expected expansion of sales to 4,000 pounds per month in the first calendar
quarter of 2023. Total sales have also recently included the selling of shrimp at the downtown Webster City, Iowa market for the local
Chamber of Commerce.
We
expect the combined output from the La Coste, Texas, and Webster City, Iowa facilities should result in a total of 20,000 pounds of shrimp
production for the calendar quarter that will end on December 31, 2022 and 40,000 pounds of shrimp production for the first calendar
quarter of 2023. We believe that the combined output from our La Coste, Texas and Iowa facilities will be approximately 24,000 pounds
of shrimp production per week by the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Also, the Company is expecting to break ground on an 80,000 square
foot expansion in La Coste prior to December 31, 2022.
The
Merger Agreement and the Merger
On
October 24, 2022, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to
time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Yotta Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Yotta”),
and Yotta Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Yotta (“Merger Sub”).
The
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Transactions”) were approved by the board of directors of
each of the Company, Yotta, and Merger Sub.
25
The
Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
company (the “Surviving Company”) in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, the Company shall be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Yotta (the “Merger ” ). In addition, Yotta will be renamed “NaturalShrimp, Incorporated” or
such other name as shall be designated by the Company. Other capitalized terms used, but not defined, herein have the respective meanings
given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.
The
Merger Agreement provides for aggregate consideration to be issued to securityholders of the Company of 17,500,000 shares (the “Closing
Merger Consideration Shares”) of Yotta’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Yotta Shares”), to be issued
at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), plus an additional (i) 5,000,000 Yotta Shares if the Surviving
Corporation has at least $15,000,000 in revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and (ii) 5,000,000 Yotta Shares if the Surviving
Corporation has at least $30,000,000 in revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (collectively, the “Contingent Merger
Consideration Shares”).
In
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time each share of Common Stock outstanding
or deemed outstanding pursuant to the provisions discussed immediately below as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into the right to receive its allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares
(to the extent the required revenue thresholds are met).
Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement and agreements that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will enter into with holders
of such convertible securities, such convertible securities will be canceled in exchange (except for the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred”) for a cash payment or Yotta Shares as follows:
(i) at the option of the holder thereof, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock will be canceled in exchange for
a cash payment based on the value thereof or treated as exercised for shares of Common Stock, in each case based on an adjusted exercise
price and as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement and/or the individual agreements, and if treated as exercised, converted into
the right to receive such deemed shares of Common Stock’s allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the
Contingent Merger Consideration Shares; (ii) each outstanding share of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share, will be canceled and treated as if converted into shares of Common Stock at an adjusted conversion rate as set forth
in the Merger Agreement and/or such individual agreements, and converted into the right to receive such deemed shares of Common Stock’s
allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares; and (iii) each outstanding
share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series E Preferred”), will
be canceled and treated as if converted into shares of Common Stock at an adjusted conversion rate as set forth in the Merger Agreement
and/or such individual agreements, and converted into the right to receive such deemed shares of Common Stock’s allocable portion
of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Contingent Merger Consideration Shares. In addition, each holder of Series E Preferred
will be entitled to receive at the Effective Time an additional number of Closing Merger Consideration Shares as are necessary to ensure
that the per-share value of the Yotta Shares that such stockholder is entitled to receive is not less than the per-share value (based
on the effective purchase price) of the aggregate Yotta Shares then held by any Yotta stockholder after taking into account any newly-issued
Yotta Shares that such Yotta stockholder acquires directly from Yotta prior to the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”)
(which will reduce the number of Closing Merger Consideration Shares that will be issued to the Company’s other securities holders).
The Series A Preferred will be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and for no consideration.
In
addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, pursuant to an agreement to be entered into between the Company and Streeterville Capital,
LLC (“Streeterville”) as the holder of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the initial amount of $16,320,000.00 issued
by the Company to Streeterville with an effective date of December 15, 2021 (the “Convertible Note”), contingent on and effective
as of the Effective Time, the Convertible Note will be amended to eliminate the conversion feature thereof. Also, such agreement will
provide for: (i) for the payment to Streeterville of an amount equal to the lesser of (A) one-third of the amount retained in the Trust
Account at the Effective Time or (B) $10,000,000, in order to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note; (ii)
that the remaining balance of the Convertible Note be repaid in equal monthly installments over a 12-month period beginning on a date
after the Closing Date or the termination of such agreement; and (iii) that if the Closing Date is after December 31, 2022, the outstanding
balance of all indebtedness owed by the Company to Streeterville will be increased automatically by 2% and will automatically increase
by 2% every 30 days thereafter until the Closing, or substantially similar terms as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
26
The
Company is required to enter into all of the above-described agreements with the holders of the warrants, preferred stockholders, and
Streeterville within 14 days of the date of the Merger Agreement, or November 7, 2022 (the “Convertible Instrument Agreements”).
The
Merger is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, following the receipt of the required approvals by the stockholders
of the Company and Yotta, conditional approval by the Nasdaq Stock Market of Yotta’s initial listing application filed in connection
with the Merger, and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.
Termination
The
Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including, without
limitation: (i) by the mutual written consent of the parties; (ii) by either Yotta or the Company if the Closing does not occur on or
prior to July 22, 2023 or, if an Additional Extension Period has been approved, at the expiration of such period (the “Outside
Termination Date”), unless the breach of any covenants or obligations under the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate
(or, in the case of Yotta, by Merger Sub) proximately caused the failure to consummate the Transactions by the applicable date; (iii)
by either Yotta or the Company if any governmental authority shall have issued an order, enacted a law, or taken any other action that
has the effect of making the Transactions illegal or permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the Transactions and such law or order or other action shall have become final and nonpeelable, unless the failure by such party or its
affiliates to comply with any provision of the Merger Agreement was a substantial cause of, or substantially resulted in, such action
by such governmental authority; (iv) by Yotta, subject to certain exceptions, if the Company has breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements in the Merger Agreement and such breach cannot be cured at all or within the earlier of (A) 30 days
after written notice thereof and (B) the Outside Termination Date; (v) by Yotta, subject to certain exceptions, if the Company does not
receive the required stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement within five business days after the effective date of the Form S-4;
(vi) by Yotta, subject to certain exceptions, if the Company fails to enter into the Convertible Instrument Agreements by November 7,
2022; and (vii) by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, if Yotta or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements in the Merger Agreement and such breach cannot be cured at all or within the earlier of (A) 30 days after written
notice thereof and (B) the Outside Termination Date.
If
the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, none of the parties to the Merger Agreement will have any liability or any further obligation
under the Merger Agreement other than customary confidentiality obligations, except in the case of a willful breach of any covenant or
agreement under the Merger Agreement or fraud, provided, that (A) if Yotta terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to clauses (iv),
(v), or (vi) of the preceding paragraph, the Company must pay to Yotta, within two business days of such termination, a termination fee
in the amount of $3,000,000, and (B) if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to clause (vii) of the preceding paragraph,
Yotta shall pay to the Company, within two business days of such termination, a termination fee in the amount of $3,000,000.
Results
of Operations
Comparison
of the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue
We
had revenue of $97,943 in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $16,640 of revenue during the quarter ended December
31, 2021. Revenues during the 2022 period were the result of our sale of shrimp to customers. At the beginning of fiscal 2023 these sales
were made to two customers of a consultant to the Company under the terms of a trial distribution agreement between the consultant and
the Company pursuant to which the consultant was to introduce the Company to customers and assist it in the set-up of ancillary materials
used or useful in the delivery of live shrimp, including installation of necessary equipment and facilities, logistical support, training
of staff and packaging necessary for shipment of live shrimp. After the trial period, the parties could have, but decided not to, negotiate
and execute a long-term distribution agreement. We began receiving orders and billing one of these customers directly in June 2022 and
the other in September 2022.

Operating
expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased approximately $622,000, or 24.6%, compared to the same period in 2021,
primarily due to increases in facility operations expense, depreciation, and salaries and related expenses partially offset by decreases
in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. Facility operations expenses increased $476,690, or 119.6%, during
the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of the progress of the planning of the commercial
operations in our Iowa and Texas facilities. Depreciation increased $198,243, or 90.9%, quarter over quarter due to the progressed fixed
assets as well as the movement of construction in process to fixed assets in the two plants. Salaries and related expenses increased
by $197,774, or 86.3%, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021, primarily due to the Company’s
increase in the number of employees and normal salary increases. Finally, professional fees during the quarter ended December 31, 2022,
decreased by $193,631 compared to the same period of 2021, due to greater than normal levels of attorneys’ work with the Company
on acquisitions and equity offerings and SEC filings, as well as consultant and accounting fees, in the 2021 period.

Other
(income) expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 changed significantly from the three months ended December 31, 2021, the
majority of which is a result of the restructuring of the December 2021 note, with the removal of the conversion feature resulting in
a “decrease” in the fair value of the derivative liability, as well as a legal settlement expense in December of 2021. As
part of the restructuring on November 4, 2021, the conversion feature was removed, and therefore the bifurcated derivative was valued
as of the restructuring date at $12,290,000, with a decrease in fair value of $17,738,000, resulting in the change in fair value being
income. There was no derivative liability in the prior period. Therefore, the change in fair value is a new recognition in the current
period. The interest expense increases in the current period, based on the two new notes issued in December of 2021 and August of 2022.
The interest rate on both notes is 12%, so the interest expense on it is approximately $592,000 for the three months ended December 31,
2022, which is the cause of the increase in interest expense for the current period as compared to the prior period. Additionally, prior
to the restructuring and accounting treatment as an extinguishment, so a removal of the original debt discounts for the two notes, there
was amortization of the recognized debt discounts on the original issuance of the notes through November 4, 2022. The amortization of
the debt discount during the three months ended December 31, 2021 was only for approximately 15 days, upon issuance of the December 2021
note.
On
December 6, 2021 a final order was signed and a case was closed for a suit filed against the Company on August 11, 2020, alleging breach
of contract for the Company’s failure to exchange common shares of the Company to shareholders of NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc.
The Company was to issue approximately 93 million shares in settlement, which had a fair value of $29,400,000, based on the market value
of the Company’s common shares of $0.316 on the date the case was closed, has been recognized in the Company’s statement
of operations as legal settlement. The fair value of the shares was recognized as an expense in the three months ended December 31. 2021.
As
a result of the restructuring of the December 2021 and August Note, which was determined to be accounted for as an extinguishment of
debt, there was a gain on the extinguishment of debt for $2,383,088, between the two notes, as other income in the three months ended
December 31, 2021. Additionally, as the Company elected the fair value option under ASC 825 for the restructured notes to be accounted
for at fair value until settled, the fair value was revalued as of the period end, with a decrease in fair value of the two notes of
$1,594,515, recognized as an expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,241,113, or 16.4%, compared to the same period in 2021,
primarily
due to increases in facility operations expense, depreciation, and amortization partially offset by decreases in salaries and related
expenses and professional fees . Facility operations expenses
increased $1,085,097, or 133.9%,
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily as a result of the progress of the planning
of the commercial operations in our Iowa and Texas facilities . Depreciation
increased $519,429,
or 62.6%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, as a result
of
the fixed assets from the new plant and the construction in process moved to fixed assets. Amortization increased $588,500, or 114.5%,
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021, as a result of the quarterly amortization for the
new patent and license rights as discussed above with respect to the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which we began
to recognize in August 2021. While there were additional employees and normal salary increases, salaries and related expenses
decreased
$473,677, or 23.8%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021, primarily due to the Company’s
payment of $700,000 in bonuses to its executive officers during the 2021 period . Professional fees
decreased during the 2022 period due to greater than normal levels of legal work, as well as consultant and accounting fees, during the
nine months ended December 31, 2021.

Other
expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, decreased significantly from the same period in 2021, the majority of which is a
result of the legal settlement expense of $29,400,000 in December of 2021, as noted in the three month change above. Additionally, as
noted in the three-month activity above, the restructuring of the December 2021 and August notes, resulted in recognition in income for
the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
As
part of the restructuring on November 4, 2021, the conversion feature was removed, and therefore the bifurcated derivative was valued
as of the restructuring date at $12,290,000, with a decrease in fair value of $17,738,000, resulting in the change in fair value of $811,000
for the nine months ending December 31, 2022 being income. There was no derivative liability in the prior period. Therefore, the change
in fair value is a new recognition in the current period. The interest expense increases in the current period, based on the two new
notes issued in December of 2021 and August of 2022. The interest rate on both notes is 12%, so the interest expense on it is approximately
$1,666,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which is the cause of the increase in interest expense for the current period
as compared to the prior period. Additionally, prior to the restructuring and accounting treatment as an extinguishment, so a removal
of the original debt discounts for the two notes, there was amortization of the recognized debt discounts on the original issuance of
the notes through November 4, 2022. As a result, the amortization of the debt discount is approximately $5,020,000 in the nine months
ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately $576,000 of amortization of the debt discount during the nine months ended December
31, 2021 based on only for approximately 15 days upon issuance of the December 2021 note.
The
warrant liability was originally recognized in December 2021, and is revalued each period end, with a decrease in the fair value as of
December 31, 2022, resulting in a $3,031,000 recognition as income, compared to an increase in fair value as of December 31, 2021, which
resulted in a $137,000 expense.
30
On
July 3, 2022, the Company’s building containing its water treatment and purification system in La Coste, Texas was completely destroyed
in a fire. This resulted in the $869,379 loss due to fire recognized in the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
On
November 22, 2021, the Company entered into a waiver with a shareholder who had the rights to participate in a subsequent filing, in
which warrants to purchase 3,739,000 shares of common stock warrants were issued with a fair value of $1,373,000 recognized as financing
costs. Additionally, in April of 2021, the Company settled a convertible note, with a redemption fee of $109,953, recognized as financing
costs. This resulted it the recognition of a financing cost expense of approximately $1,483,000.
The
Company’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan was approved for forgiveness on April 26, 2021 and, therefore, was
recognized in the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity,
Financial Condition and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of approximately $142,000 and working capital deficit of approximately $8,191,000, as compared
to cash on hand of approximately $1,734,000 and a working capital deficiency of approximately $17,017,000 as of March 31, 2022. The increase
in working capital for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, is mainly due to the decrease in cash on-hand, as well as the decrease
in the fair value of the derivative liability due to the removal of the conversion feature in the restructured December 2021 Note, and
a decrease in fair value of the warrant liability. This is offset by the new promissory notes and related party notes, and an increase
in accounts payable.
Working
Capital/(Deficit)
Our
working capital as of December 31, 2022, in comparison to our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2021, can be summarized as follows:
December 31,
March 31,
2022
2022
Current assets
$ 868,398
$ 4,829,141
Current liabilities
9,059,549
21,846,261
Working capital deficiency
$ (8,191,151 )
$ (17,017,120 )
Current
assets decreased mainly because of the release of the $1,500,000 escrow account as of March 31, 2022 related to the proceeds from the
issuance of a convertible debenture in December 2021, which was transferred to the Company’s cash. Then there was a decrease in
cash based on the use of the cash on hand, and a decrease of approximately $1,020,000 in prepaid expenses. The decrease in current liabilities
is primarily due to the $13,101,000, decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability, related to the removal of the conversion
feature in the restructuring of the December 2021 Note, as well as the by the decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability. This
is offset by the new promissory note, which upon its restructuring was treated as an extinguishment and then recognized at its fair value
under ASC 825, at approximately $2,219,000 and the $250,000 notes payable-related party.
Cash
Flows
Our
cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, in comparison to our cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2021,
can be summarized as follows:
Nine months Ended December 31,
2022
2021
Net cash used in operating activities
$ (3,884,764 )
$ (12,201,031 )
Net cash used in investing activities

4,022,773
22,609,954
Net change in cash
$ (1,592,176 )
$ 2,509,411
31
The
net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 is approximately $8,316,000 less as compared to the
same period in 2021. The decrease in cash used is based mainly on the increase in accounts payable in the current period compared to
the decrease in accounts payable in the prior period. Additionally, there is a decrease in prepaid expenses and an increase accrued interest
related to the August note as well as the addition for the current period’s nine months on the December 2021 note.
The
net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $6,169,000 compared to the
same period in the prior nine-month period. During the current period cash used consists of the purchase of approximately $2,430,000 for
machinery and equipment, offset by the $700,000 received from the insurance company for the fixed assets destroyed by the July 3, 2022 fire. The prior year’s cash spent on investing activities consisted of the $2,000,000 of cash in the patent
acquisition, $2,350,000 for the License Agreement and $1,000,000 in the acquisition of shares of the non-controlling interest, as well
as approximately $2,116,000 for machinery and equipment and $433,000 for construction in process.
The
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $18,587,000 between periods. For the current period, the Company
received $1,380,000 from the financing agreement for the sale of shares of common stock, as well as $1,465,000 net proceeds on a new
promissory note, and $250,000 from a promissory note with related parties. Additionally, the $1,500,000 that had been held in escrow
from the convertible note the Company entered into in December of 2021 has been transferred into its cash on hand. In the same period
in the prior year, the Company received approximately $17,277,000 from the sale of common stock and warrants, and $8,905,000 of net proceeds
from entering into the December 2021 note, offset by amounts paying off the previous convertible note, notes payable with related parties
and bank loans, and the amount paid on the redemption of Series D Preferred Shares.
Our
cash position was approximately $142,000 as of December 31, 2022. Management believes that our cash on hand and working capital deficit
are not sufficient to meet our current anticipated cash requirements for additional anticipated capital expenditures, operating expenses
and scale-up of operations for the next twelve months  .
Recent
Financing Arrangements and Developments During the Period
Short-Term
Debt and Lines of Credit
The
Company also has a working capital line of credit with Capital One Bank for $50,000. The line of credit bears an interest rate of prime
plus 25.9 basis points, which totaled 33.17% as of December 31, 2022. The line of credit is unsecured. The balance of the line of credit
was $9,580 at both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
The
Company also has a working capital line of credit with Chase Bank for $25,000. The line of credit bears an interest rate of prime plus
10 basis points, which totaled 17.27% as of December 31, 2022. The line of credit is secured by assets of the Company’s subsidiaries.
The balance of the line of credit is $10,237 at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
Promissory
Note
The
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with an investor (the “Investor”) on August
17, 2022. Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor purchased a secured promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount
totaling approximately $5,433,333 (the “Principal Amount”). The Note has an interest rate of 12% per annum, with a maturity
date nine months from the issuance date of the Note (the “Maturity Date”). The Note carried an original issue discount totaling
$433,333 and a transaction expense amount of $10,000, both of which are included in the principal balance of the Note. On the Closing
Date the Company received $1,100,000, with $3,900,000 put into escrow to be held until certain terms are met, which includes $3,400,000
upon the completion of a successful uplist to NYSE or NASDAQ. The SPA includes a Security Agreement, whereby the note is secured by the
collateral set forth in the agreement, covering all of the assets of the Company. All payments made by the Company under the terms in
the note, including upon repayment of this Note at maturity, shall be subject to an exit fee of 15% of the portion of the Outstanding
Balance being paid (the “Exit Fee”).
32
As
soon as reasonably possible, the Company will cause the Common Stock to be listed for trading on either of (a) NYSE, or (b) NASDAQ (in
either event, an “Uplist”). In the event the Company has not effectuated the Uplist by November 15, 2022, the then-current
outstanding balance will be increased by 10%. Following the Uplist, while the Note is still outstanding, ten days after the Company may
have a sale of any of its shares of common stock or preferred stock, there shall be a Mandatory Prepayment equal to the greater of $3,000,000
or thirty-three percent of the gross proceeds of the equity sale.
In
conjunction with the Merger Agreement, entered into on October 24, 2022, with Yotta Acquisition Corporation (Note 10), on November 4,
2022, the Company entered into a Restructuring Agreement for an Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “August Note”),
through which the August Note was amended and restated in its entirety. The Restructuring Agreement included key modifications, in which
i) the Uplist terms were removed, ii) in the event that the Closing of the Merger does not occur on or before December 31, 2022, the
then-current Outstanding Balance will be increased by 2% and shall increase by 2% every 30 days thereafter until the Closing or termination
of the Merger Agreement, and iii) the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note may be increased by 5% to 15% upon the occurrence of
an event of default or failure to obtain the Lender’s consent or notify the Lender for certain major equity related transactions
(“Trigger Events”). The Merger has not yet closed, and therefore the 2% of the outstanding balance was increased as of December
31, 2022, in the amount of approximately $35,000.
The
Restructured August Note was analyzed under ASC 470-50 as to if the change in terms qualified as a modification or an extinguishment
of the note. The changes in terms were considered an extinguishment as the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new
debt instrument was evaluated to be a substantial change, as over 10% difference from the present value of the remaining cash flows under
the terms of the original instrument. As such, with the removal of the original note and its debt discount and accrued interest as compared
to the restructured note with a fair value of approximately $1,933,000, there was a loss in extinguishment of approximately $157,000.
As a result of the extinguishment and at the Company’s election of the fair value option under ASC 825, the August Note will be
accounted for at fair value until they are settled. In accordance with ASC 815- 15-25-1(b) a hybrid instrument that is measured at fair
value under ASC 825 fair value option each period with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur should not be evaluated
for embedded derivatives. Therefore, the provisions in the August Note were not evaluated as to if they fell under the guidance of embedded
derivatives and were required to be bifurcated. The August Note was revalued as of December 31, 2022 at approximately $2,219,000, with
a change in fair value of approximately $286,000 recognized in the Statement of Operations.
Promissory
Note – related parties
On
August 10, 2022, the Company issued a loan agreement for $300,000, with related parties, which is to be considered priority debt of the
Company. As of this filing, five of the related parties have entered into promissory notes under the loan agreement for $50,000 each,
for a total of cash received of $250,000. The notes bear interest at a 10% per annum and are due in one year from the date of the note.
Convertible
Debentures
The
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “December 2021 SPA”) with an investor (the “December 2021
Investor”) on December 15, 2021. Pursuant to the December 2021 SPA, the December 2021 Investor purchased a secured promissory note
(the “December 2021 Note”) in the aggregate principal amount totaling approximately $16,320,000. The December 2021 Note has
an interest rate of 12% per annum, with a maturity date 24 months from the issuance date of the December 2021 Note (the “Maturity
Date”). The December 2021 Note carried an original issue discount totaling $1,300,000 and a transaction expense amount of $20,000,
both of which are included in the principal balance of the December 2021 Note. The December 2021 Note had $2,035,000 in debt issuance
costs, including fees paid in cash of $1,095,000 and 3,000,000 warrants issued to placement agents with a fair value of $940.000. The
warrant fair value was estimated using the Black Scholes Model, with the following inputs: the price of the Company’s common stock
of $0.32; a risk-free interest rate of 1.19%, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock of 209.9%; the estimated remaining
term, a dividend rate of 0%. The warrants were classified as a liability, as it is not known if there will be sufficient authorized shares
to be issued upon settlement, based on the conversion terms of the convertible debt.
33
Beginning
on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date of the December 2021 Note, the December 2021 Investor has the right to redeem up
to $1,000,000 of the outstanding balance per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash,
or (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common
Stock”), per the following formula: the number of redemption shares equals the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided
by the Redemption Repayment Price. The “Redemption Repayment Price” equals 90% multiplied by the average of the two lowest
volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date that the
December 2021 Investor delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the December 2021 Note. The redemption amount shall include a
premium of 15% of the portion of the outstanding balance being paid (the “Exit Fee”). In addition to the December 2021 Investor’s
right of redemption, the Company has the option to prepay the December 2021 Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date by paying a
premium of 15% plus the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date.
Within
180 days of the issuance date of the December 2021 Note, the Company will obtain an effective registration statement or a supplement
to any existing registration statement or prospectus with the SEC registering at least $15,000,000 in shares of Common Stock for the
December 2021 Investor’s benefit such that any redemption using shares of Common Stock could be done using registered Common Stock.
Additionally, as soon as reasonably possible following the issuance of the December 2021 Note, the Company will cause the Common Stock
to be listed for trading on either of (a) NYSE, or (b) NASDAQ (in either event, an “Uplist”). In the event the Company has
not effectuated the Uplist by March 1, 2022, the then-current outstanding balance will be increased by 10%. On February 7, 2022, the
Company and the December 2021 Investor entered into an amendment to the SPA, which extended the date by which the Uplist must be completed
to April 15, 2022. In consideration of the grant of the extension there was an extension fee of $249,079 added to the principal balance,
which has been recognized as a financing cost in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement. Subsequently,
the date by which the Uplist had to be completed was further extended to June 15, 2022, and again to November 15, 2022, with no additional
fee included. The Company will make a one-time payment to the December 2021 Investor equal to 15% of the gross proceeds the Company receives
from the offering expected to be effected in connection with the Uplist (whether from the sale of shares of its Common Stock and / or
preferred stock) within ten (10) days of receiving such amount. In the event Borrower does not make this payment, the then-current outstanding
balance will be increased by 10%. The December 2021 Note also contains certain negative covenants and Events of Default. Upon an Event
of a Default, at its option and sole discretion, the December 2021 Investor may consider the December 2021 Note immediately due and payable.
Upon such an Event of Default, the interest rate increases to 18% per annum and the outstanding balance of the December 2021 Note increases
from 5% to 15%, depending upon the specific Event of Default.
On
November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Restructuring Agreement for an Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “Senior
Note”) with the December 2021 Investor through which the December 2021 Note was amended and restated in its entirety. These amendments
were made in conjunction with the Merger Agreement, entered into on October 24, 2022, with Yotta Acquisition Corporation (Note 10), The
main modification of the terms of the Senior Note was that the conversion feature was eliminated. Second, a Mandatory Payment was added
whereby within 3 trading days of the closing upon the Merger an amount equal to the lesser of (A) one-third of the amount retained in
the Trust Account at the Effective Time or (B) $10,000,000, in order to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the Convertible
Note; after which the remaining balance of the Convertible Note is to be repaid in equal monthly installments over a 12-month period
beginning on a date after the Closing Date or the termination of such agreement. Additionally, if the Closing Date is after December
31, 2022, the outstanding balance of all indebtedness owed by the Company to December 2021 Investor will be increased automatically by
2% and will automatically increase by 2% every 30 days thereafter until the Closing, or substantially similar terms as approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company. Additional key modifications include i) the Uplist terms were removed, ii) Maturity date was modified
from December 15, 2023 to December 4, 2023, and iii) the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note may be increased by 5% to 15% upon
the occurrence of an event of default or failure to obtain the Lender’s consent or notify the Lender for certain major equity related
transactions (“Trigger Events”). As of December 31, 2022, the Merger has not yet closed, and therefore the 2% of the outstanding
balance was increased as of December 31, 2022, in the amount of approximately $1,309,000.
34
The
Restructured Senior Note was analyzed under ASC 470-50 as to if the change in terms qualified as a modification or an extinguishment
of the note. The changes in terms were considered an extinguishment as the conversion feature has been eliminated and therefore the modified
August Note is determined to be fundamentally different from the original convertible note. As such, with the removal of the original
note and its debt discount and accrued interest as compared to the restructured note with a fair value of approximately $18,914,000,
there was a gain in extinguishment of approximately $2,540,000. As a result of the extinguishment and at the Company’s election
of the fair value option under ASC 825, the Senior Note will be accounted for at fair value until it is settled. In accordance with ASC
815- 15-25-1(b) a hybrid instrument that is measured at fair value under ASC 825 fair value option each period with changes in fair value
reported in earnings as they occur should not be evaluated for embedded derivatives. Therefore, the provisions in the Senior Note were
not evaluated as to if they fell under the guidance of embedded derivatives and were required to be bifurcated. The Senior Note was revalued
as of December 31, 2022 at approximately $20,223,000, with a change in fair value of approximately $1,309,000 recognized in the Statement
of Operations.
GHS
Purchase Agreement
On
November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “GHS Purchase Agreement”) with GHS Investments LLC (“GHS”),
an accredited investor, pursuant to which, the Company may require GHS to purchase a maximum of up to 64,000,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock (“GHS Purchase Shares”) based on a total aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000,000 over a one-year term that
ends on November 4, 2023.
Notwithstanding the foregoing dollar limitations, the Company and GHS
may, from time to time, mutually agree in writing to waive the aforementioned limitations for a relevant Purchase Notice, which waiver,
shall not exceed the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation contained in the GHS Purchase Agreement.
The Company is to control
the timing and amount of any sales of GHS Purchase Shares to GHS. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes.
The
“Purchase Price” means, with respect to a purchase made pursuant to the GHS Purchase Agreement, 90% of the lowest VWAP during
the 10 consecutive business days immediately preceding, but not including, the applicable purchase date. The Company shall deliver a
number of GHS Purchase Shares equal to 112.5% of the aggregate purchase amount for such GHS Purchase divided by the Purchase Price per
share for such GHS Purchase.
If
there are any default events, as set forth in the GHS Purchase Agreement, has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall not deliver
to GHS any Purchase Notice.
Further,
pursuant to the terms of the GHS Purchase Agreement, from November 4, 2022 until the date that is the later of (i) the closing of the
transactions whereby Yotta Merger Sub, Inc. will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company (the “Merger”);
and (ii) the 12 month anniversary of the first delivery of GHS Purchase Shares, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent
Financing”), GHS shall have the right to participate in any financing, up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing equal to 100%
of the Subsequent Financing (the “Participation Maximum”) on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent
Financing. Following the Merger, the Participation Maximum shall be 50% of the Subsequent Financing.
In
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 17,175,675 shares of common stock at a net amount of approximately $1,378,000,
at share prices ranging from $0.08 to $0.10. There were 11,306.351 additional shares of common stock sold after the period end (see Note
11).
Common
Shares Issued to Consultant
On
April 14, 2021, 500,000 shares of common stock were issued to a consultant per an agreement entered into on January 20, 2021 for advisory
services for a two-year period. The shares had a fair value of $195,000, based on the market price of $0.39 on the grant date. 62,500
shares of common stock shall vest each quarter through October 1, 2022, at $24,275, with approximately $171,000 vested through December
31, 2022.
Common
Stock Issued in Relation to Business Agreement
On
August 1, 2022, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock to a consultant per the terms of an agreement from June 2021, to be
issued upon the approval of a patent.
35
As
of June 22, 2022, 250,000 common shares were issued in relation to a trial distribution agreement, which after the result of the trial
period, both parties may negotiate and execute a long-term distribution agreement. The shares will be paid by the Company withholding
sufficient profits from the sale by the other party of the live shrimp
Going
Concern and Management Liquidity Plans
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been prepared, assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated losses through the period to December 31, 2022 of approximately
$163,038,000 as well as negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $4,754,000. Presently, the Company does not have
sufficient cash resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following the date of issuance of this filing. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing
alternatives in order to finance the continued build-out of our equipment and for general and administrative expenses. These alternatives
include raising funds through public or private equity markets and either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is
no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund-raising initiatives, management believes that the Company will be able
to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing financing discussions with third party investors and existing shareholders.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional
financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity,
the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Company’s common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable
terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage
of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing
its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease
operations.
Future
Financing
We
will require additional funds to implement our growth strategy for our business. In addition, while we have received capital from various
private placements that have enabled us to fund our operations, these funds have been largely used to develop our processes, although
additional funds are needed for other corporate operational and working capital purposes. However, not including funds needed for capital
expenditures or to pay down existing debt and trade payables, we anticipate that we will need to raise an additional $2,500,000
to cover all of our capital and operational expenses over the next 12 months, not including any capital expenditures needed as part of
any commercial scale-up of our equipment. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which
may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available
to us when needed or, if available, that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain
the additional necessary financing on a timely basis, or if we are unable to generate significant revenues from operations, we will not
be able to meet our other obligations as they become due, and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders.
Effects
of Inflation
We
do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.
36
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We believe that the accounting policies below
are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Fair
Value Measurement
The
fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement
that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance
are described below:
Level
1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
Level
2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; or
Level
3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).
The
Derivative and warrant liabilities are Level 3 fair value measurements.
Basic
and Diluted Earnings/Loss per Common Share
Basic
and diluted earnings or loss per share (“EPS”) amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are computed
in accordance with ASC 260 – 10 “Earnings per Share”, which establishes the requirements for presenting EPS. Basic
EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available
to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (denominator) during the period.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which would be
converted at the holder’s option into approximately 751,385,000 underlying common shares, 170 shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible
Preferred shares whose approximately 2,775,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’ option at conversion price of
90% of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days, 750,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock which would be converted
at the holders’ option into approximately 180,333,000 underlying common shares, whose shares were included in the calculation of
diluted EPS. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,500 shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred
shares whose approximately 5,143,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’ option at a fixed conversion price of
$0.35, and 18,573,116 warrants outstanding which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive
as their conversion and exercise prices were greater than the market price of the Company’s common shares. For the nine months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which would be converted at the holder’s
option into approximately 768,561,000 underlying common shares, 1,500 shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred shares whose
approximately 5,143,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’ option at a fixed conversion price of $0.35, and 170
shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred shares whose approximately 2,775,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’
option at conversion price of 90% of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days, 750,000 shares of Series F Preferred
Stock which would be converted at the holders’ option into approximately 184,387,000 underlying common shares, and 18,573,116 warrants
outstanding which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and nine
months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock with approximately 9,842,000 underlying common
shares, $18,768,000 in a convertible debenture whose approximately 67,816,000 underlying shares are convertible at the holders’
option at conversion price of 90 % of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days and 18,506,429 warrants outstanding
which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
37
Impairment
of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets
The
Company will periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant
such a review and at least annually. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted
cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in
a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as
such, the Company records revenue when their customers obtain control of the promised goods or services in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company will sell primarily to food service distributors, as
well as to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.
To
determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs
the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer by receipt of purchase orders and confirmations sent by the Company
which includes a required line of credit approval process, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract which includes shipment
of goods to the customer FOB shipping point or destination, (3) determine the transaction price which initiates with the purchase order
received from the customer and confirmation sent by the Company and will include discounts and allowances by customer if any, (4) allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract which is the shipment of the goods to the customer and transaction
price determined in step 3 above and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation which is when the
Company transfers control of the goods to the customers by shipment or delivery of the products.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Our
recently adopted accounting pronouncements are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included herein for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity
(“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing
the existing guidance in ASC 470-20,
Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options , that requires entities to account for beneficial
conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock; (2) revises
the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that are both
indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity
classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260,
Earnings Per Share , to require entities to calculate diluted earnings
per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities must presume share settlement for
purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting
companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should
adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
38
During
the period ending December 31, 2022, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of
any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not
Applicable. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required
to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
The
Company’s management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
Based
upon that evaluation , our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.
Thus, there remains a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This does not include an evaluation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm
regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we cannot provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, to
allow our principal financial and executive officers to make timely decisions regarding required disclosures as of December 31, 2022.
Management’s
evaluation was based on the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which existed as of March
31, 2022, and which continue to exist, as discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K:
●   Inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;
●   Lack
of independent Board of Directors (as of the balance sheet date) and absence of Audit Committee
to exercise oversight responsibility related to financial reporting and internal control;
●   Lack
of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks in
a timely manner; and
●   Lack
of documentation on policies and procedures that are critical to the accomplishment of financial
reporting objectives.
39
Our
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach and the effectiveness of our internal controls
and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements
or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
Remediation
Plan
Management
continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such
that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.
The
remediation actions planned include:
● Identify
gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting
requirements of a public company;
● Establish
an independent Board of Directors (which we expect to establish in our fourth fiscal quarter
that will end on March 31, 2023) and an Audit Committee to provide oversight for remediation
efforts and ongoing guidance regarding accounting, financial reporting, overall risks and
the internal control environment;
● Retain
additional accounting personnel with public company financial reporting, technical accounting,
SEC compliance, and strategic financial advisory experience to achieve adequate segregation
of duties; and
● Continue
to develop formal policies and procedures on accounting and internal control over financial
reporting and monitor the effectiveness of existing controls and procedures.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
PART
II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
We
are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries,
threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries’
officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. The Company has
resolved all outstanding litigation involving the Company and there are no suits or cases pending in which the Company is a party.
Item
1A. Risk Factors
Factors
that could cause or contribute to differences in our future financial and operating results include those discussed in the risk factors
set forth in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The risks described in our Form 10-K and this
Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider significant
may also have an adverse effect on the Company. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition could suffer.
There
have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
2022, filed with SEC on June 29, 2022 other than the following:
In
this document:
●
“Business Combination” means the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
40
●
“Merger Agreement” means that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2022, by and among Yotta, Merger Sub and
NaturalShrimp, as it may be amended or supplemented.
●
“Merger Sub” means Yotta Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Yotta.
●
“New NaturalShrimp” means the combined company after the Business Combination.
●
“New NaturalShrimp Common Stock” means the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New NaturalShrimp.
●
“Yotta” means Yotta Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
New
NaturalShrimp will issue shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock as consideration in the Business Combination and may issue additional
shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock or other equity or convertible debt securities without approval of the holders of New NaturalShrimp
Common Stock, which would dilute then-existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of the New NaturalShrimp Common Stock.
We
anticipate that, following the Business Combination, (i) former NaturalShrimp securityholders will own approximately 51.6% of the outstanding
shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock, (ii) former Yotta stockholders will own approximately 46.9% of the outstanding shares of New
NaturalShrimp Common Stock, and (iii) the representative of the underwriters in Yotta’s initial public offering will own 1.5% of the outstanding shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock. These percentages are based on the pro forma ownership of
New NaturalShrimp Common Stock as of September 30, 2022, and assume, among other things, that no shares of Yotta’s common stock
are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination or any further extensions of the date by which Yotta must consummate an initial
business combination. If the actual facts differ from these assumptions, these percentages will differ.
New
NaturalShrimp may continue to require capital investment to support its business and may issue additional shares of New NaturalShrimp
Common Stock or other equity or convertible debt securities of equal or senior rank in the future without approval of its stockholders
in certain of circumstances.
New
NaturalShrimp’s issuance of additional shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock or other equity or convertible debt securities
would have the following effects: (i) New NaturalShrimp’s existing stockholders’ proportionate ownership interest in New
NaturalShrimp would decrease; (ii) the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;
(iii) the relative voting power of each previously outstanding shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock may be diminished; and (iv) the
market price of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock may decline.
Yotta
may be subject to the Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in connection with redemptions of its Common Stock
after December 31, 2022.
On
August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise
tax on any publicly traded domestic corporation that repurchases its stock after December 31, 2022 (the “Excise Tax”).
The Excise Tax is imposed on the fair market value of the repurchased stock, with certain exceptions. Because Yotta is are a
Delaware corporation and because its securities trade on Nasdaq, it is a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the
Inflation Reduction Act. While not free from doubt, absent any further guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the
“Treasury”), who has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse
or avoidance of the Excise Tax, the Excise Tax may apply to any redemptions of Yotta’s common stock after December 31, 2022,
including redemptions in connection with the Business Combination, unless an exemption is available. Generally, issuances of
securities in connection with an initial business combination transaction (including any PIPE transaction at the time of an initial
business combination) are expected to reduce the amount of the Excise Tax in connection with redemptions occurring in the same
calendar year. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by Yotta and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any
required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined.
41
Future
resales of shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock issued to NaturalShrimp stockholders and other significant stockholders may cause
the market price of the New NaturalShrimp Common Stock to drop significantly, even if New NaturalShrimp’s business is doing well.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately after the closing of the Business Combination NaturalShrimp’s securityholders will
hold approximately 51.6% of the outstanding shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock, approximately [●]% of which will be eligible
for sale immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination. These percentages are based on the pro forma ownership of New
NaturalShrimp Common Stock as of September 30, 2022, and assume among other things, and that no shares of Yotta’s common stock are
redeemed in connection with the Business Combination or any further extensions of the date by which Yotta must consummate an initial business
combination. If the actual facts differ from these assumptions, these percentages will differ. Pursuant to Lock-Up Agreements entered
into in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain New NaturalShrimp stockholders will be restricted, subject to certain
exceptions, from selling any of the New NaturalShrimp Common Stock that they receive in or hold at the effective time of the Business
Combination, which restrictions will expire, and therefore additional shares of New NaturalShrimp Common Stock will be eligible for resale
six months after the effective time of the Business Combination.
Subject
to the Lock-Up Agreements, the NaturalShrimp stockholders that are a party thereto (which are NaturalShrimp’s three executive
officers and directors) may sell New NaturalShrimp Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”),
if available. In these cases, the resales must meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule, including, because Yotta
is currently a shell company, waiting until one year after New NaturalShrimp’s filing with the SEC of Form 10-type information
reflecting the Business Combination.
Upon expiration of the lock-up periods set forth in the Lock-Up Agreements, and upon effectiveness of the registration statement that
New NaturalShrimp will be required to file pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into prior
to the closing of the Business Combination by Yotta, certain stockholders of Yotta and certain stockholders of NaturalShrimp who will
be affiliates of New NaturalShrimp immediately after the closing, or upon satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 144, certain former
Yotta stockholders and certain other significant stockholders of New NaturalShrimp may sell large amounts of New NaturalShrimp Common
Stock in the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in New NaturalShrimp’s
share price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of the New NaturalShrimp Common Stock.
New
NaturalShrimp may be unable
to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.
If
New NaturalShrimp fails to meet the continued listing requirements and Nasdaq delists its securities, it could face significant material
adverse consequences, including:
●
a
limited availability of market quotations for its securities;
●
a
limited amount of news and analyst coverage for New NaturalShrimp; and
●
a
decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future
We
face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic that could significantly disrupt our research and development, operations, sales, and financial
results, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact.
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The spread of the outbreak has caused significant disruptions
in the global economy, and the impact may continue to be significant. While the threat level has declined to a significant extent in
the United States and globally, and our operations have not been materially and negatively impacted by the pandemic to date, our business
could be adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as government efforts to control or combat it, particularly
if there is a resurgence in infections, including as a result of the emergence of new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. In
addition to global macroeconomic effects, the COVID-19 outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments could cause
disruption to our operations and manufacturing activities. For example, if governments re-implement restrictions in an attempt to combat
any resurgence of COVID-19, we may experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or
other movement and restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to develop and design
our products and services in a timely manner or meet required milestones. Further, our third-party equipment manufacturers, third-party
raw material suppliers, and consultants have been and may continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, and restrictions
on employees’ ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures,
or other travel or health-related restrictions, which could adversely affect our business and operations. Other epidemics or outbreaks
of infectious diseases could have similar impacts on NaturalShrimp as well.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds
There
were no unregistered sales of the Company’s equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that were not previously
reported in an Annual Report on Form 10-K, a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or a Current Report on Form 8-K except as follows:
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 17,175,675 shares of common stock at a net amount of approximately $1,378,000,
at share prices ranging from $0.08 to $0.10.
Unless
otherwise specified, the above securities were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The issuance
of the shares to the consultant qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) since the issuance by us did not involve a public offering.
The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in 4(a)(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the
transactions, manner of the issuance and number of securities issued. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number
of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, the investor had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(a)(2)
since they agreed to and received securities bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the
Act. This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part
of a “public offering”. Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption
under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
