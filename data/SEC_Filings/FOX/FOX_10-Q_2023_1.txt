DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Fox Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“FOX” or the “Company”), is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments: Cable Network Programming, Television and Other, Corporate and Eliminations. On October 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) had formed a special committee composed of independent members of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to begin exploring a potential combination with News Corporation. On January 24, 2023, the Company announced that the Board had received a letter from K. Rupert Murdoch withdrawing the proposal to explore the potential combination and, as a result of this action, the Special Committee was dissolved. The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of FOX have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The preparation of the Company’s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. These interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). All significant intercompany transactions and accounts within the Company’s consolidated businesses have been eliminated. Investments in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence generally exists when the Company owns an interest between 20% and 50%. Equity securities in which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% ownership interest) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either at fair value or using the measurement alternative method, which is at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. All gains and losses on investments in equity securities are recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30 (“fiscal”) of each year. Certain fiscal 2022 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2023 presentation. The unaudited and audited consolidated financial statements are referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein. The unaudited consolidated statements of operations are referred to as the “Statements of Operations” herein. The unaudited and audited consolidated balance sheets are referred to as the “Balance Sheets” herein. Recently Adopted, Recently Issued Accounting Guidance and Other Inflation Reduction Act On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act which, among other changes, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. Once subject to the CAMT, a taxpayer will compute both its CAMT liability and its regular federal
6 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS tax liability and pay the higher of the two. To the extent that the CAMT liability exceeds the regular federal tax liability, a taxpayer will receive a credit (“CAMT credit”) which can be used against its regular federal tax liability in the future when the taxpayer is no longer subject to the CAMT. The CAMT credit does not expire. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, which means it will be applicable to the Company starting in fiscal 2024. The excise tax on stock repurchases applies to stock repurchases occurring after December 31, 2022. The Company continues to evaluate the impact the CAMT will have on its financial statements but expects that, when applicable, the Company will be subject to the CAMT. The CAMT would impact the timing of the cash tax benefit the Company receives from the amortization of the additional tax basis received as a result of the Transaction Tax (as defined in Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2022 Form 10-K). This change in timing would result in an increase to its annual cash tax liability which could be material. However, as noted above, if the Company pays CAMT it will receive a CAMT credit that can be carried forward indefinitely and applied against its regular federal tax liability in future years. The Company will be subject to the excise tax on stock repurchases occurring after December 31, 2022, but the impact to the financial statements is not expected to be material. NOTE 2.
ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS The Company’s acquisitions support the Company’s strategy to strengthen its core brands, grow its digital businesses and selectively enhance production capabilities for its digital and linear platforms. There were
no
acquisitions during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company made acquisitions, primarily consisting of
three
entertainment production companies, for total cash consideration of approximately $ 230
million. The revenues and Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 10—Segment Information) included within the Company’s consolidated results of operations associated with these companies were not material individually or in the aggregate. NOTE 3.
INVENTORIES, NET The Company’s inventories were comprised of the following: As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 (in millions)
Licensed programming, including prepaid sports rights $ 1,534   $ 975   Owned programming 446   337   Total inventories, net 1,980   1,312   Less: current portion of inventories, net ( 1,300 ) ( 791 ) Total non-current inventories, net $ 680   $ 521   Owned programming Released $ 253   $ 205   In-process and other 193   132   Total $ 446   $ 337   7 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the aggregate amortization expense related to Inventories, net included in Operating expenses in the Statements of Operations: For the three months ended December 31,

FAIR VALUE Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which distinguishes market participant assumptions into the following categories: (i) inputs that are quoted prices in active markets (“Level 1”); (ii) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities (“Level 2”); and (iii) inputs that require the entity to use its own assumptions about market participant assumptions (“Level 3”). The following tables present information about financial assets and redeemable noncontrolling interests carried at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair value measurements

(b) The Company utilizes both the market and income approach valuation techniques for its Level 3 fair value measures. Inputs to such measures could include observable market data obtained from independent sources such as broker quotes and recent market transactions for similar assets. It is the Company’s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs in the measurement of its Level 3 fair value measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based upon the assumptions market participants would use in valuing the redeemable noncontrolling interests. Examples of utilized unobservable inputs are future cash flows and long-term growth rates. In connection with the combination of The Stars Group Inc. and Flutter in May 2020, FOX Sports received the right to acquire an
18.6 % equity interest in FanDuel Group (“FanDuel”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter, at a price set forth in the relevant agreement (structured as a
10 -year option), which has been the subject of arbitration proceedings. In January 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
8 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS confirmed and entered the arbitrator’s ruling affirming FOX Sports’
10 -year call option expiring in December 2030 to acquire
18.6 % of FanDuel for $ 3.72  billion, with a
5 % annual escalator. FOX has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. In addition, Flutter cannot pursue an initial public offering for FanDuel without FOX’s consent or approval from the arbitrator. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The redeemable noncontrolling interests recorded are put rights held by minority shareholders in Credible Labs Inc. (“Credible”) and an entertainment production company.
The changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests classified as Level 3 measurements were as follows:
For the three months ended December 31,
For the six months ended December 31,
2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions)
Beginning of period $ ( 193 ) $ ( 302 ) $ ( 188 ) $ ( 261 ) Acquisitions (a) —   ( 13 ) —   ( 58 ) Net loss 5   3   10   4   Distributions —   —   —   3   Accretion and other (b) ( 8 ) 140   ( 18 ) 140   End of period $ ( 196 ) $ ( 172 ) $ ( 196 ) $ ( 172 ) (a) The increase for the six
months ended December 31, 2021
was primarily due to the acquisition of an entertainment production company. (b) As a result of the expiration of the sports network minority shareholder’s final put right during the three months ended December 31, 2021, approximately $ 110
million was reclassified into equity. The Credible minority put right will become exercisable in fiscal 2025. The put right held by the entertainment production company’s minority shareholder will become exercisable in fiscal 2027. Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments exclusive of borrowings, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and investments, accounted for using the measurement alternative method, approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 (in millions) Borrowings Fair value $ 6,822   $ 7,084   Carrying value $ 7,208   $ 7,206   Fair value is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market (a Level 1 measurement). Concentrations of Credit Risk Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may
9 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. Generally, the Company does not require collateral to secure receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s receivables. NOTE 5.
BORROWINGS Borrowings include senior notes (See Note 9—Borrowings in the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Public Debt – Senior Notes Issued”). In addition, the Company is party to a credit agreement providing a $ 1.0
billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $ 150
million available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of March 2024 (See Note 9—Borrowings in the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Revolving Credit Agreement”). As of December 31, 2022, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. NOTE 6.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Stock Repurchase Program The Board has authorized a $ 4
billion stock repurchase program under which the Company can repurchase Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock”) and Class B Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”). The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately
16  million shares of Common Stock for approximately $ 500  million. Repurchased shares are retired and reduce the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Company allocates the amount of the repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $ 900
million.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately
1.6  million shares of Common Stock for approximately $ 50  million and the Company announced that the Board has authorized incremental stock repurchases of an additional $ 3
billion of Common Stock. With this increase, the Company’s total stock repurchase authorization is now $ 7

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has
one
equity plan, the Fox Corporation 2019 Shareholder Alignment Plan (See Note 12—Equity-Based Compensation in the 2022 Form 10-K). 10 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table summarizes the Company’s equity-based compensation: For the three months ended December 31, For the six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Equity-based compensation $ 25   $ 32   $ 32   $ 47   Intrinsic value of all settled equity-based awards $ —   $ 18   $ 76   $ 94   Tax benefit on settled equity-based awards $ ( 1 ) $ 4   $ 13   $ 21   The Company’s equity-based awards are settled in Class A Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total estimated compensation cost, not yet recognized, related to non-vested equity awards held by the Company’s employees was approximately $ 120
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period between
one
and
two years . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately
5
million and
6  million stock options outstanding, respectively. The computation of diluted earnings per share did not include stock options outstanding during each period presented if their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Awards Vested and Granted Restricted Stock Units During the six months ended December 31, 2022
and
2021 , a pproximately
1.5
million and
2.4
million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) vested and approximately
2.0
million and
1.7
million RSUs were granted,
respectively. These RSUs
generally vest in equal annual installments over a
three-year
period subject to participants’ continued employment with the Company. Performance-Based Stock Options During the six months ended December 31, 2022
and
2021, the Company granted approximately
4
million performance-based stock options, in each period, which will vest in full at the end of a
three-year
performance period if the market condition is met, and have a term of
seven years
thereafter. NOTE 8.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The total firm commitments and future debt payments as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were approximately $ 39
billion and $ 42
billion, respectively. The decrease from June 30, 2022 was primarily due to sports programming rights payments. In December 2022, the Company renewed the operating lease for its corporate headquarters at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York through fiscal 2042. In connection with this extension, the Company recorded additional operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $ 540
million as of December 31, 2022. Contingencies FOX News The Company’s FOX News business and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex and race. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements
11 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS or reserved for pending or future claims is material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. The amount of additional liability, if any, that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity In connection with the separation of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (“21CF”) and News Corporation in June 2013 (the “21CF News Corporation Separation”), 21CF agreed to indemnify News Corporation, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the 21CF News Corporation Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials that occurred at subsidiaries of News Corporation before the 21CF News Corporation Separation, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with News Corporation (the “U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity”). In accordance with the Separation Agreement (as defined in Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “The Distribution”), the Company assumed certain costs and liabilities related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity. The liability recorded in the Balance Sheets related to the indemnity was approximately $ 115
million and $ 65
million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the liability recorded was attributable to an increase in the number of civil claims submitted in September 2022 in advance of the September 30, 2022 cutoff date set by the judge for this phase of the litigation. Defamation and Disparagement Claims From time to time, the Company and its news businesses, including FOX News Media and the FOX Television Stations, and their employees are subject to lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement. These include lawsuits filed by Smartmatic USA Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Smartmatic”) in February 2021 and Dominion Voting Systems, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Dominion”) in March 2021. The Dominion lawsuits against the Company and its subsidiary, FOX News Media, have been consolidated for trial, which is scheduled to begin in April 2023. The Company believes these lawsuits, including the Smartmatic and Dominion matters, are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously, including through any appeals. To date, none of the amounts the Company has paid in settlements of defamation or disparagement claims or reserved for pending or future claims is material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. The amount of additional liability, if any, that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. For the contingencies disclosed above for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, other than the accrual provided, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss. The Company’s operations are subject to tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. Each member of the 21CF consolidated group, which includes
12 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21CF, the Company (prior to the Distribution (as defined in Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “The Distribution”)) and 21CF’s other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income and, in certain jurisdictions, state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21CF consolidated group. The tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the Separation (as defined in Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “The Distribution”) requires 21CF and/or The Walt Disney Company to indemnify the Company for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the Internal Revenue Service in amounts that the Company cannot quantify. NOTE 9.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. The net periodic benefit cost was $ 16
million and $ 13
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 32
million and $ 27
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and
2021, respectively. NOTE 10.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments:
• Cable Network Programming , which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies (“traditional MVPDs”), virtual multi-channel video programming distributors (“virtual MVPDs”) and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. • Television , which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) service TUBI,
29
full power broadcast television stations, including
11
duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S.
Eighteen
of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network,
10
are affiliated with MyNetworkTV and
one
is an independent station. • Other, Corporate and Eliminations , which principally consists of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance marketplace. The Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s businesses. 13 FOX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables set forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:   For the three months ended December 31, For the six months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021   (in millions)

The Company’s revenues increased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from
20 television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to the broadcast of the Fédération International de Football Association (“FIFA”) Men’s
World Cup,
higher political advertising revenue at FOX Television Stations principally due to the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections, additional National Football League (“NFL”) regular season games, higher NFL ratings and continued growth at TUBI. Partially offsetting this increase was the absence of NFL
Thursday Night Football
(“ TNF ”) and lower direct response advertising revenue at FOX News Media. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of entertainment production companies in fiscal 2022 and higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. Operating expenses decreased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the absence of
TNF , partially offset by higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup
and NFL and Major League Baseball (“MLB”) content and higher costs associated with increased digital investment at FOX News Media and TUBI. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher legal and employee related costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
The Company’s revenues increased 4% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup,
higher political advertising revenue at FOX Television Stations principally due to the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections, additional NFL regular season games, higher NFL pricing and continued growth at TUBI. Partially offsetting this increase was the absence of
TNF
and lower ratings at FOX Entertainment. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of entertainment production companies in fiscal 2022 and higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. Operating expenses decreased 1% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the absence of
TNF , partially offset by higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup
and NFL and MLB content, and increased digital investment at TUBI and FOX News Media. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher legal and employee related costs. Depreciation and amortization —Depreciation and amortization expense increased 11% and 17% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased spending as a result of digital initiatives and the impact of the fiscal 2022 acquisitions of entertainment production companies. Other, net —See Note 11—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Other, net.” Income tax (expense) benefit —The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items. The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2021
was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, offset by other permanent items. 21 Net income (loss) —The Company recorded net income of $321 million and $934 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $73 million and net income of $635 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher Segment EBITDA (as defined below) at the Television segment and a higher gain recognized on the change in fair value of the Company's investment in Flutter Entertainment plc, partially offset by lower Segment EBITDA at the Cable segment. Segment Analysis The Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s businesses. The following tables set forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three and six

Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment remained relatively flat for the
three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, as the decreases in affiliate fee and advertising revenues were offset by higher other revenues. The decrease in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to a lower average number of subscribers, partially offset by higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals. The decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in traditional MVPD subscribers, partially offset by an increase in virtual MVPD subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower direct response advertising revenue at FOX News Media, partially offset by the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup
at the national sports networks in the current year quarter. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA decreased 47% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, due to higher expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization, led by the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup,
the renewed MLB contract, and additional college football games at the national sports networks, and increased digital investment at FOX News Media. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher legal costs at FOX News Media. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment remained relatively flat for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, as the decrease in affiliate fee revenue was offset by higher advertising and other revenues. Affiliate fee revenue remained relatively consistent as the decrease in the average number of subscribers was offset by higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals.

three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup , additional regular season NFL games, higher NFL ratings, higher political advertising revenue at FOX Television Stations principally due to the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections, and continued growth at TUBI. Partially offsetting this increase was the absence of
TNF
on the FOX Network in the current year. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the Company’s owned and operated television stations. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of entertainment production companies in fiscal 2022. Television Segment EBITDA increased $529 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, due to the revenue increases noted above and lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of
TNF , partially offset by higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by the broadcast of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup
and NFL content including additional regular season games, as well as increased digital investment in TUBI. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee related costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenues at the Television segment increased 7% for the

Operating expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees and the costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company’s Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 25 The following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021:   For the three months ended December 31, For the six months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021   (in millions)

Condition The Company has approximately $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 5—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements). The Company also has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants. The principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the Company’s programming; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; and stock repurchases. The Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company’s securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.
