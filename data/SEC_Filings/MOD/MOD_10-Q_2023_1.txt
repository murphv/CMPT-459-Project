MODINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
Note 1: General
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Modine Manufacturing Company
(“Modine” or the “Company”) were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Rule
10 - 01
of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  The financial statements include all normal recurring
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods.  Results for the
first
nine months of fiscal
2023
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
related notes in Modine’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the year ended March
31, 202 2.
Disposition of Austrian Air-cooled Automotive Business in Fiscal 2022
On April
30, 2021,
the Company sold
its air-cooled automotive business in Austria to Schmid Metall GmbH.  As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a loss of
$ 6.6
million
during the
first
quarter of fiscal
2022,
which included the write-off of
$ 1.7
million
of net
actuarial losses related to its pension plan.  The Company reported this loss within the loss on sale of assets line on the consolidated statement of operations.  Upon transaction closing,
$ 5.9
million
of cash within the business transferred to the buyer. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, a
purchase price adjustment for net working capital and certain other items was finalized and the Company paid the buyer $ 2.4
million.
In connection with the sale of this business, the Company provided the buyer with a
5 -year, € 4.0
million loan facility.  The buyer began borrowing
under this facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. At both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a € 4.0
million loan receivable within other noncurrent assets on its consolidated balance sheet because the Company expects to receive the principal repayment more than twelve months from the balance sheet date. Borrowings under the loan facility
currently bear interest at
4.6
percent.
Liquid-Cooled
Automotive Business Held for Sale in Fiscal 2022
The Company previously
agreed to sell its liquid-cooled automotive business.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company and the prospective buyer modified the transaction perimeter to remove certain manufacturing operations.  U.S. GAAP requires companies
to measure asset groups that revert back to held and used classification at the lower of their (i) carrying value, as if held for sale classification had not been met; or (ii) fair value at the date of the decision not to sell.  As a result,
the Company evaluated the long-lived assets of these businesses that no longer met the requirements to be classified as held for sale and reversed $ 7.4
million of previously-recorded impairment charges during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to adjust the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.
During the third
quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company and the prospective buyer terminated the sale agreement and the liquid-cooled automotive business reverted back to held and used classification.  As a result, the Company remeasured the long-lived assets
within the liquid-cooled automotive business and reversed $ 57.2
million of previously-recorded held for sale impairment charges
during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
On a year-to-date
basis, the $ 64.6
million of impairment reversals described above were partially offset by $ 8.6
million of impairment charges related to the automotive assets while they were classified as held for sale during fiscal 2022, resulting in a net impairment reversal of
$ 56.0
million.  The Company reported all impairment charges and reversals during fiscal 2022 within the impairment charges
(reversals) line on the consolidated statements of operations.

MODINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
Disposition of Previously-Closed Facility in Fiscal 2022
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell a previously-closed manufacturing facility in the U.S.
As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 0.3
million within the Climate Solutions segment to write down the property
to fair value less costs to sell.  During July 2021, the sale was completed and the Company received net cash proceeds of $ 0.7
million.
New Accounting Guidance: Supplier Finance Programs
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance that will require companies that use supplier finance
programs to disclose information about the programs, including key terms, outstanding obligations under such programs and where outstanding amounts are presented within their financial statements.  In addition, a roll forward of obligations
under supplier finance programs will be required annually.  The new guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal 2024 financial statements, with the exception of the roll forward disclosure requirement, which will become effective one year
later.  The Company is currently evaluating the new disclosures, but does not expect the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 2: Revenue Recognition
Effective April 1, 2022, the Company began managing its operations under
two
operating segments, Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies.  The Climate Solutions segment includes the previously-reported Building HVAC Systems (“BHVAC”) and the Commercial
and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) segments, with the exception of CIS Coatings.  The Performance Technologies segment includes the previously-reported Heavy Duty Equipment (“HDE”) and Automotive segments and the CIS Coatings business.  See Note 19
for additional segment financial information.
The Company’s operating segments and their principal revenue-generating activities are as follows:
Climate Solutions
The Climate Solutions segment provides energy-efficient, climate-controlled components and solutions for a wide array of
applications.  The Climate Solutions segment principally generates revenue from selling heat transfer products, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (“HVAC & refrigeration”) products, and data center cooling solutions.

Contract assets

Contract
assets, included within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily consist of capitalized costs related to customer-owned tooling contracts, wherein the customer has guaranteed reimbursement, and assets recorded for revenue
recognized over time, which represent the Company’s rights to consideration for work completed but not yet billed.  The $ 3.0
million
decrease in contract assets during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily resulted from a decrease in contract assets for revenue recognized over time.
Contract
liabilities, included within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations under customer contracts, including contracts for customer-owned tooling.  The
$ 0.1
million increase in contract liabilities during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily resulted from payments received in
advance of the Company’s satisfaction of performance obligations.
Note 3: Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
•
Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•
Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in
which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
•
Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such measurements as Level 1.  In some cases, where market prices are not
available, the Company uses observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified as Level 2.  If quoted or observable market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value based upon
valuation models that use, where possible, market-based data such as interest rates, yield curves or currency rates.  These measurements are classified as Level 3.
The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term debt approximate fair
value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is disclosed in Note
16 .

The Company’s funding policy is to contribute annually, at a minimum, the amount
necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. In connection with funding relief provisions within the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Company does not expect to make cash
contributions to its U.S. pension plans during fiscal 2023.
Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based incentive programs consist of the following: (1) a long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) for officers and other executives that
consists of stock awards, stock options, and performance-based awards granted for retention and performance, (2) a discretionary equity program for other management and key employees, and (3) stock awards for non-employee directors.
The Company calculates compensation expense based upon the fair value of the awards at the time of grant and subsequently recognizes expense ratably over
the respective vesting periods of the stock-based awards. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 1.5
million and $ 1.1
million
for the three months ended December
31 , 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 5.0

Note 8: Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
25.6
percent
and
0.1
percent , respectively.
The
Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
23.8
percent and
8.7
percent, respectively.
The
effective tax rates for the fiscal 2022 periods were significantly impacted by the Company’s accounting for the liquid-cooled automotive business, which had been previously classified as held for sale.  During the nine months ended December 31,
2021, the Company recorded net impairment reversals totaling $ 56.0
million related to this business, primarily driven by the
remeasurement of its property, plant and equipment assets upon reverting back to held and used classification during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  In addition, the effective tax rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal
2022 were favorably impacted by $ 8.2
million and $ 11.4
million, respectively, from income tax benefits related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, as further described below.  See Note 1 for additional
information regarding the net impairment reversals related to the liquid-cooled automotive business.
The Company records valuation allowances
against its net deferred tax assets to the extent it determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the future. Each quarter, the Company evaluates the probability that its deferred tax assets will be realized and
determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In
addition, the Company considers the duration of statutory carryforward periods and historical financial results.
Based upon its quarterly analyses in fiscal 2022, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions will be
realized.  As a result, the need for the valuation allowances recorded thereon was eliminated and the Company recorded income tax benefits of $ 4.8
million and $ 8.2
million during the first and third quarters of fiscal 2022, respectively.  The Company’s analyses in these quarters
included consideration of the transaction perimeter modification during the first quarter and the termination of the sale agreement during the third quarter for the liquid-cooled automotive business and the related impairment reversals.  In
addition, based upon the Company’s analysis as of September 30, 2021, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction will not be realized.  As a result, the Company recorded an income tax
charge of $ 1.6
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which partially offset the $ 13.0
million of income tax benefits recorded during the first and third quarters.  Combined, these fiscal 2022 valuation allowance adjustments resulted in a net income tax
benefit of $ 11.4
million during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 .
At December 31, 2022, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and in certain foreign
jurisdictions totaled
$ 84.9
million
and
$ 28.1   million, respectively. The Company will maintain the valuation allowances in each applicable tax jurisdiction until it determines it is more
likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized, thereby eliminating the need for a valuation allowance.  Future events or circumstances, such as lower taxable income or unfavorable changes in the financial outlook of the Company’s
operations in certain foreign jurisdictions, could necessitate the establishment of further valuation allowances .
At present, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.  Based upon current and anticipated future
earnings in the U.S., the Company believes it is reasonably possible that in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 or in fiscal 2024, sufficient positive evidence may be available to conclude that a significant portion of the U.S. valuation allowance
is not needed. The Company estimates such valuation allowance release would result in a decrease to income tax expense of up to $ 65.0
million in the period recorded.  However, the ultimate timing of such a release, if any, and the resulting decrease to income tax expense, could differ from the Company’s current estimates.
Accounting
policies for interim reporting require the Company to adjust its effective tax rate each
quarter to be consistent with its estimated annual effective tax rate.  Under this methodology, the Company applies its estimated annual income tax rate to its year-to-date ordinary earnings to derive its income tax provision each quarter. The
Company records the tax impacts of certain significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items in the period in which they occur.  The Company excluded the impact of its operations in certain foreign locations from the overall effective tax rate
methodology and recorded them discretely based upon year-to-date results because the Company anticipates net operating losses for the full fiscal year in these jurisdictions. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax
benefits during the remainder of fiscal 2023.

Note 16: Indebtedness
In October 2022, the Company executed an
amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a multi-currency $ 275.0
million revolving credit
facility and U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated term loan facilities maturing in October 2027.  In addition, the credit agreement provides for shorter-duration swingline loans.  This credit agreement modified the Company’s then existing $ 250.0
million revolver and term loan facilities, which would have matured in June 2024.
In connection with the credit agreement
modification, the Company incurred $ 2.2
million of debt issuance costs.  Of these costs, the Company deferred $ 1.5
million, which will be amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt, and recorded $ 0.7
million as interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.  The Company paid $ 0.6
million of the debt issuance costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the remaining issuance costs were added to the new term loan principal at the time of the modification.
Long-term debt consisted of the following:

Borrowings under the revolving credit,
swingline and term loan facilities bear interest at a variable rate based upon the applicable reference rate and including a margin percentage dependent upon the Company’s leverage ratio, as described below.  At December 31, 2022, the
weighted-average interest rates for revolving credit facility borrowings and the term loans were
4.1
and
5.6
percent, respectively.  Based upon the terms of the credit agreement, the Company classifies borrowings under its revolving credit and swingline
facilities as long-term and short-term debt, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheets.

(unaudited)
At December 31, 2022, the Company’s borrowings under its revolving credit and swingline facilities totaled $ 27.5
million and $ 6.0
million, respectively, and domestic letters of credit totaled $ 5.3
million.  As a result, available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility was $ 236.2
million as of
December 31, 2022 . At March 31, 2022, the Company’s borrowings under its revolving credit and
swingline facilities totaled $ 64.9
million and $ 7.0
million, respectively.
The Company also maintains credit agreements for its foreign subsidiaries.  The
outstanding short-term borrowings related to these foreign credit agreements totaled $ 5.3
million and $ 0.7
million at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
Provisions in the Company’s credit agreement, Senior Note agreements, and various foreign credit agreements require the Company to maintain compliance with various
covenants and include certain cross-default clauses.  Under its primary debt agreements in the U.S., the Company has provided liens on substantially all domestic assets.  Also, as specified in the credit agreement, the term loans may require
prepayments in the event of certain asset sales.  In addition, at the time of each incremental borrowing under the revolving credit facility, the Company is required to represent to the lenders that there has been no material adverse effect, as
defined in the credit agreement, on its business, property, or results of operations.
The leverage ratio covenant requires the Company to limit its consolidated indebtedness, less a portion of its cash balances, both as defined by the credit agreements, to
no more than
three and one-quarter
times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other
adjustments (“Adjusted EBITDA”).  The Company is also subject to an interest expense coverage ratio covenant, which requires the Company to maintain Adjusted EBITDA of at least
three
times consolidated interest expense.  The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022.
The Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt using discounted future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable
maturities. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt approximated fair value, with the exception of the Senior Notes, which had an aggregate fair value of $ 123.7
million and $ 138.9
million, respectively.  The fair value of
the Company’s long-term debt is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Refer to Note 3 for the definition of a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Note 17: Risks, Uncertainties, Contingencies and Litigation
Supply Chain Disruptions
and Inflationary Market
Conditions
Market and economic dynamics, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, have contributed to global supply chain challenges and
inflationary market conditions.  The Company is focused on mitigating the negative impacts of labor shortages, supply chain challenges and inflationary market conditions, including changes in raw material, energy, logistic, and interest costs, as
well as delays and shortages in certain purchased commodities and components.
The Company cannot reasonably estimate the full impact
that
the ongoing
supply chain challenges and other related economic
and
market dynamics
will have on
the
Company’s
business , results of operations and cash flows
in the future .
Environmental
T he Company has recorded environmental investigation and remediation accruals related to manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one of which the Company currently owns and operates, and a former
manufacturing facility in the Netherlands.  These accruals primarily relate to soil and groundwater contamination at facilities where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under then-existing
regulations, or where the Company is a successor to the obligations of prior owners, and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance.  In instances where a range of loss
can be reasonably estimated for a probable environmental liability, but no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum of the range.  The Company’s accruals for environmental matters totaled
$ 18.6
million and $ 18.2
million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company increased its remediation accrual related to a former manufacturing facility in the U.S. by
$ 1.0
million and $ 3.4
million, respectively.  As additional information becomes
available regarding the environmental matters, the Company will re-assess the liabilities and revise the estimated accruals, if necessary.  While it is possible that the ultimate environmental remediation costs may be in excess of amounts accrued,
the Company believes, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position.  However, these matters are subject
to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could occur, including significant monetary damages.
Other Litigation
In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various lawsuits and enforcement proceedings by private parties, governmental
agencies and/or others in which claims are asserted against Modine.  The Company believes that any additional loss in excess of amounts already accrued would not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of
operations, and cash flows.  In addition, management expects that the liabilities which may ultimately result from such lawsuits or proceedings, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position .

Note 19: Segment Information
Effective April 1, 2022, the Company began managing its operations under
two
operating segments, Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies.  The Climate Solutions segment includes the previously-reported BHVAC and CIS
segments, with the exception of CIS Coatings.  The Performance Technologies segment includes the previously-reported HDE and Automotive segments and the CIS Coatings business.  See Note 2 for information regarding the primary operating activities of
each segment.  The Company’s new segment structure aligns businesses serving similar or complimentary end markets, products and technologies under common segment management.
The Company
believes this simplified segment structure allows it to better focus resources on targeted growth opportunities and better enables for an efficient application of 80/20 principles across all product lines to optimize profit margins and cash flow.
The segment realignment had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Segment financial information for the prior periods has been recast to conform to the current presentation.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
When we use the terms “Modine,” “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “our” in this report, we are referring to Modine Manufacturing Company.  Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and, accordingly, all references to quarters refer to our fiscal quarters.  The
quarter ended December 31, 2022 was the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
Supply Chain Disruptions and Inflationary Market Conditions
Market and economic dynamics, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have contributed to global supply chain challenges and inflationary market conditions.  We are focused on mitigating
the negative impacts of labor shortages, supply chain challenges and inflationary market conditions, including changes in raw material, energy, logistic, and interest costs, as well as delays and shortages in certain purchased commodities and
components.  We have implemented selling price increases for many of our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and are engaged with suppliers to ensure availability of key raw materials.
We cannot reasonably estimate the full impact that the ongoing supply chain challenges and other related economic and market dynamics will have on our business, results of operations, or cash flows in the future.
Third Quarter Highlights
Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $57.8 million, or 12 percent, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher sales in our Performance Technologies and Climate Solutions segments.  Cost of sales increased
$34.8 million, or 8 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume.  Gross profit increased $23.0 million and gross margin improved 250 basis points to 17.4 percent.  Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $7.7 million,
primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses.  Operating income of $39.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $39.9 million from the prior year, primarily due to the absence of a $57.2 million impairment reversal
recorded in the prior year related to the liquid-cooled automotive business, which reverted back to held and used classification upon the termination of a sale agreement with the prospective buyer during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  See Note 1
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the liquid-cooled automotive business, which was classified as held for sale during the first seven months of fiscal 2022.
Year-to-date Highlights
Net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $204.1 million, or 14 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales in each of our operating segments.  Cost of sales increased $141.0 million, or 11 percent,
from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher raw material costs, including underlying metal prices and related premiums, fabrication, freight, and packaging costs.  Gross profit increased $63.1 million and gross
margin improved 200 basis points to 16.5 percent.  SG&A expenses increased $11.5 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses.  Operating income of $101.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $3.3
million from the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by the absence of a $55.7 million net impairment reversal recorded in the prior year that primarily related to the liquid-cooled automotive business.

Comparison of Three Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Third quarter net sales of $560.0 million were $57.8 million, or 12 percent, higher than the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volume in each of our segments and favorable commercial pricing.  These increases were
partially offset by a $30.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Sales in the Performance Technologies and Climate Solutions segments increased $35.8 million and $21.3 million, respectively.
Third quarter cost of sales increased $34.8 million, or 8 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume,  partially offset by a $25.5 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased
250 basis points to 82.6 percent, primarily due to the favorable impacts of higher sales volume and commercial pricing, partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs.
As a result of higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, third quarter gross profit increased $23.0 million and gross margin improved 250 basis points to 17.4 percent.
Third quarter SG&A expenses increased $7.7 million, primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses, which increased approximately $5.0 million, and, to a lesser extent, increases in other general and administrative expenses that have
been impacted by inflationary market conditions.  The compensation-related expenses included higher incentive compensation expenses driven by improved financial results, as compared with the prior year.  These increases were partially offset by a
$2.3 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and lower strategic reorganization costs recorded at Corporate, which decreased $0.9 million.
Restructuring expenses of $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $2.0 million compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower severance and equipment transfer costs in the Climate Solutions and
Performance Technologies segments, respectively.
24
Table of Contents
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, in connection with the termination of the agreement to sell the liquid-cooled automotive business, we reversed $57.2 million of previously-recorded impairment charges within the Performance Technologies
segment.  See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Operating income of $39.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $39.9 million compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the absence of the significant impairment reversal recorded in the prior year, partially
offset by higher gross profit.
Interest expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $2.1 million compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to unfavorable changes in interest rates.  In addition, we amended and extended our U.S. credit agreement
that provides for a multi-currency revolving credit facility and U.S. dollar- and euro- denominated term loans maturing in October 2027, along with shorter-duration swingline loans.  In connection with this credit agreement modification, we recorded
$0.7 million of costs as interest expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
The provision for income taxes was $8.5 million and $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The $8.4 million increase was primarily due the absence of an $8.2 million income tax benefit recorded during the third
quarter of fiscal 2022 resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances in foreign jurisdictions.
Comparison of Nine Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Fiscal 2023 year-to-date net sales of $1,679.8 million were $204.1 million, or 14 percent, higher than the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume in both of our segments and favorable commercial pricing, including adjustments
in response to raw material price increases.  These increases were partially offset by a $93.1 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Sales in the Performance Technologies and Climate Solutions segments increased $102.2
million and $97.9 million, respectively.
Fiscal 2023 year-to-date cost of sales of $1,402.6 million increased $141.0 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher raw material prices, which increased approximately $42.0 million.  These increases were partially
offset by an $80.2 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 200 basis points to 83.5 percent, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher sales volume and favorable commercial
pricing, partially offset by higher material, labor and other inflationary costs.
As a result of higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased $63.1 million and gross margin improved 200 basis points to 16.5 percent.
Fiscal 2023 year-to-date SG&A expenses increased $11.5 million, primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses, which increased approximately $14.0 million and included higher incentive compensation and commission-related expenses,
and, to a lesser extent, increases in other general and administrative expenses that have been impacted by inflationary market conditions.  These increases were partially offset by a $7.1 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, strategic reorganization costs, costs associated with our review of strategic alternatives for our automotive businesses, and environmental charges related to a previously-closed manufacturing facility in the U.S., which are each
recorded at Corporate, decreased $3.1 million, $2.3 million, and $1.8 million, respectively, during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared with the same period in the prior year.
Restructuring expenses of $2.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 decreased $0.8 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to lower severance expenses in the Climate Solutions segment, partially offset by higher
restructuring expenses in the Performance Technologies segment.
25
Table of Contents
The net impairment reversal of $55.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 primarily related to the liquid-cooled automotive business within the Performance Technologies segment.  See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.
We sold our Austrian air-cooled automotive business on April 30, 2021.  As a result of the sale, we recorded a $6.6 million loss on sale at Corporate during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Operating income of $101.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $3.3 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to the $63.1 million increase in gross profit and the absence of the $6.6 million loss on
the sale of the Austrian air-cooled automotive business in the prior year.  These drivers, which increased operating income in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, were partially offset by the absence of the $55.7 million net impairment reversal
recorded in the prior year and higher SG&A expenses.
Interest expense during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $2.9 million compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable changes in interest rates and $0.7 million of costs recorded in connection with the
credit agreement modification during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
The provision for income taxes was $19.8 million and $7.4 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The $12.4 million increase was primarily due to the absence of a net $11.4 million income tax benefit related to
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions recorded in the prior year.
SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Effective April 1, 2022, we began managing the company under two operating segments, Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies.  Our new segment structure aligns businesses serving similar or complimentary end markets, products and
technologies under common segment management.  This simplified segment structure allows us to better focus resources on targeted growth opportunities and better enables an efficient application of 80/20 principles across all product lines to optimize
profit margins and cash flow.
The Climate Solutions segment provides energy-efficient, climate-controlled solutions and components for a wide array of applications.  The Climate Solutions segment sells heat transfer products, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and
refrigeration (“HVAC and refrigeration”) products, and data center cooling solutions.  The Performance Technologies segment provides products and solutions that enhance the performance of customer applications and develops solutions that increase
fuel economy and lower emissions in light of increasingly stringent government regulations.  The Performance Technologies segment designs and manufactures air- and liquid-cooled technology for vehicular, stationary power, and industrial
applications.  In addition, the Performance Technologies segment provides advanced thermal solutions to zero-emission and hybrid commercial vehicle and automotive customers and coating products and application services.
The Climate Solutions segment includes the previously-reported Building HVAC Systems and Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) segments, with the exception of CIS Coatings.  The Performance Technologies segment includes the
previously-reported Heavy Duty Equipment and Automotive segments and the CIS Coatings business.  The segment realignment had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Segment financial information for
fiscal 2022 has been recast to conform to the current presentation.

Comparison of Three Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Climate Solutions net sales increased $21.3 million, or 9 percent, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable commercial pricing.  This increase was partially
offset by a $13.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Compared with the third quarter of the prior year, sales of data center cooling, heat transfer, and HVAC & refrigeration products increased $16.3 million, $2.8
million, and $2.2 million, respectively.
Climate Solutions cost of sales increased $8.4 million, or 5 percent, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by an $11.6 million favorable impact of foreign
currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 360 basis points to 78.0 percent, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher sales volume, and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher labor and
inflationary costs.
As a result of the higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased $12.9 million and gross margin improved 360 basis points to 22.0 percent.
SG&A expenses increased $1.0 million, yet decreased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales.  The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses that have been impacted by inflationary
market conditions and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation-related expenses.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Restructuring expenses decreased $1.5 million compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  The fiscal 2022 restructuring expenses primarily consisted of severance expenses related to targeted headcount reductions in Europe and China.
Operating income of $30.2 million increased $13.4 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher gross profit.

Table of Contents
Comparison of Nine Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Climate Solutions year-to-date net sales increased $97.9 million, or 15 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable commercial pricing, including adjustments in response to raw material price
increases.  These increases were partially offset by a $43.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Compared with the same period in the prior year, sales of heat transfer, data center cooling, and HVAC & refrigeration
products increased $41.3 million, $37.6 million, and $18.9 million, respectively.
Climate Solutions year-to-date cost of sales increased $45.8 million, or 8 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, higher raw material prices, which increased by approximately $10.0
million.  These increases were partially offset by a $37.0 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 470 basis points to 78.3 percent, primarily due to the favorable impact of
higher sales volume, favorable commercial pricing, and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs.
As a result of the higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased $52.1 million and gross margin improved 470 basis points to 21.7 percent.
Climate Solutions year-to-date SG&A expenses increased $5.3 million, yet decreased 60 basis points as a percentage of sales.  The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, including higher
commission expenses, and   increases in other general and administrative expenses that have been impacted by inflationary market conditions.  These increases were partially offset by a $3.5 million favorable impact
of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Restructuring expenses of $0.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 decreased $1.4 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to lower severance expenses.  The severance expenses during the first nine months of
fiscal 2022 primarily related to targeted headcount reductions in Europe and China.  The $0.3 million of restructuring expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily consisted of closure costs related to a previously-leased facility.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million to write-down a previously-closed manufacturing facility in the U.S. to fair value less costs to sell.  We sold the facility and received net cash proceeds
of $0.7 million during July 2021.
Operating income of $89.9 million increased $48.5 million from the same period last year, primarily due to higher gross profit and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.

Comparison of Three Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Performance Technologies net sales increased $35.8 million, or 13 percent, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable commercial pricing.  These increases were
partially offset by a $16.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Compared with the third quarter of the prior year, sales of air-cooled, liquid-cooled, and advanced solutions products increased $20.8 million, $10.5 million,
and $5.2 million respectively.
28
Table of Contents
Performance Technologies cost of sales increased $25.7 million, or 10 percent, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, higher labor costs.  These
increases were partially offset by a $14.0 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 180 basis points to 86.5 percent, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher sales volume
and commercial pricing, partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs.
As a result of the higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased $10.1 million and gross margin improved 180 basis points to 13.5 percent.
SG&A expenses increased $2.1 million compared with the third quarter of the prior year.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses decreased by 30 basis points.  The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher product
development costs and other general and administrative expenses that have been impacted by inflationary market conditions.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Restructuring expenses of $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $0.5 million compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower equipment transfer costs.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and in connection with the termination of the agreement to sell the liquid-cooled automotive business, we reversed $57.2 million of previously-recorded impairment charges to adjust the long-lived assets of
the liquid-cooled automotive business to the lower of their carrying or fair value.  See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Operating income of $17.4 million decreased $48.7 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the absence of the significant impairment reversal recorded in the prior year, partially offset
by higher gross profit.
Comparison of Nine Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Performance Technologies year-to-date net sales increased $102.2 million, or 12 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable commercial pricing, including adjustments in response to raw material price
increases.  These increases were partially offset by a $49.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, the absence of sales from the Austrian air-cooled automotive business, which we sold on April 30,
2021.  Compared with the same period in the prior year, sales of air-cooled, liquid-cooled, and advanced solutions products increased $65.4 million, $24.6 million, and $16.3 million respectively.
Performance Technologies year-to-date cost of sales increased $89.6 million, or 12 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher raw material prices, which increased by approximately $32.0 million.  In
addition, to a lesser extent, higher labor costs and higher depreciation expenses negatively impacted cost of sales.  During fiscal 2022, we did not depreciate the held for sale property, plant and equipment assets within the liquid-cooled automotive
business until they reverted back to held and used classification during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  These increases were partially offset by a $43.4 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  As a percentage of sales, cost
of sales was consistent with the same period in the prior year, as the higher material, labor and other inflationary costs were offset by the favorable impact of higher sales.
29
Table of Contents
As a result of the higher sales and a consistent gross margin at 12.1 percent, gross profit increased $12.6 million.
Performance Technologies year-to-date SG&A expenses decreased $1.2 million compared with the same period last year.  As a percentage of sales, year-to-date SG&A expenses decreased by 100 basis points.  The decrease in SG&A expenses was
primarily due to a $3.8 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and, to a lesser extent, lower compensation-related expenses, partially offset by higher product development costs and other general and administrative
expenses that have been impacted by inflationary market conditions.
Restructuring expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $0.6 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher severance expenses, partially offset by lower equipment transfer costs.  The severance
expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily related to targeted headcount reductions in Europe.  Restructuring expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 primarily consisted of equipment transfer costs.
The year-to-date net impairment reversal of $56.0 million in fiscal 2022 primarily related to assets in our liquid-cooled automotive business.  The $57.2 million impairment reversal during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was partially offset by
$1.2 million of net impairment charges recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2022.  See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Operating income of $41.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 decreased $42.8 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the absence of the significant net impairment reversal recorded in the prior year, partially
offset by higher gross profit.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities, our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 of $82.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $236.2 million under our revolving credit facility.  Given our
extensive international operations, approximately $78.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are available for general corporate use; however, these funds may be subject
to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated.  We believe our sources of liquidity will provide sufficient cash flow to adequately cover our funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $67.9 million, which represents a $60.5 million increase compared with the same period in the prior year.  This increase in operating cash flow was primarily
due to the favorable impact of higher earnings and favorable net changes in working capital, as compared with the same period in the prior year.  While inventories have increased $32.4 million from March 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the increase
has been less significant than the increase during the same period last year.  In fiscal 2023, the Company has increased its inventory levels to support higher production levels.
In fiscal 2022, the higher
inventory levels largely resulted from increased raw material prices and impacts from global supply constraints and challenges, which continue to impact our businesses in fiscal 2023.  In addition, the favorable changes in working capital include
lower payments for incentive compensation and lower pension plan contributions in fiscal 2023, as compared with the same period in the prior year.

Table of Contents
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures of $35.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $4.5 million compared with the same period in the prior year.  The fiscal 2023 capital expenditures include investments supporting our strategic growth
initiatives, including expanding our data center business.
Debt
In October 2022, we executed an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a multi-currency $275.0 million revolving credit facility and term loan facilities maturing in October 2027.  This credit agreement
modified our then existing $250.0 million revolver and term loan facilities, which would have matured in June 2024.
Our credit agreements require us to maintain compliance with various covenants, including a leverage ratio covenant and an interest expense coverage ratio covenant discussed further below.  The permitted leverage and interest expense coverage
ratios were not modified by the recent credit agreement amendment.  Also, as specified in the credit agreement, the term loans may require prepayments in the event of certain asset sales.  In addition, at the time of each incremental borrowing under
the revolving credit facility, we must represent to the lenders that there has been no material adverse effect, as defined in the credit agreement, on our business, property, or results of operations.
The leverage ratio covenant requires us to limit our consolidated indebtedness, less a portion of our cash balance, both as defined by the credit agreements, to no more than three and one-quarter times consolidated net earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other adjustments (“Adjusted EBITDA”).  We are also subject to an interest expense coverage ratio covenant, which requires us to maintain Adjusted EBITDA of at least three times consolidated interest
expense.  As of December 31, 2022, our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio were 1.6 and 12.4, respectively.  We expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the remainder of fiscal 2023 and beyond.
Share Repurchase Program
During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased $4.7 million of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2022, we had $47.9 million of authorized share repurchases remaining under the current repurchase program, which expires in
November 2024.  Our decision whether and to what extent to repurchase additional shares will depend on a number of factors, including business conditions, other cash priorities, and stock price.

of proposals regarding other business at shareholder meetings, including requiring additional background information and disclosures regarding proposing shareholders, proposed nominees and business, and other persons related to a shareholder’s
solicitation of proxies, such as additional information about the ownership of securities of the Company.
