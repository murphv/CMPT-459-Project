CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking
statements.” Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations,
strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements
are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements
due to numerous factors discussed from time to time in this Report and in other documents which we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In addition, such statements could be affected by risks and uncertainties related to:
●
the cost, timing and results of our pre-clinical and clinical trials;
●
our ability to raise funds for general corporate purposes and operations, including our pre-clinical and clinical trials;
●
our ability to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
●
the commercial feasibility and success of our technology and product candidates;
●
our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and scientific and technical personnel to carry out our operations; and
●
the other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report.
Any forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date on which they are made, and except as may be required under applicable securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to
update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the filing date of this Report.

(Unaudited)
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Citius,”
the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a late-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and
commercialization of first-in-class critical care products with a focus on oncology, anti-infectives in adjunct cancer care, unique prescription
products and stem cell therapies.
On March 30, 2016, Citius acquired Leonard-Meron
Biosciences, Inc. (“LMB”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary by issuing shares of its common stock.
On September 11, 2020, we formed NoveCite, Inc.
(“NoveCite”), a Delaware corporation, of which we own
75 % ( 7,500,000
shares) of the issued and outstanding capital stock (see
Note 3).
On August 23, 2021, we formed Citius Acquisition
Corp. (“Citius Acq.”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with the acquisition of I/ONTAK, which began operations
in April 2022.
In-process research and development (“IPR&D”)
consists of (i) the $ 19,400,000
acquisition value of LMB’s drug candidate Mino-Lok®, which is an antibiotic solution used to
treat catheter-related bloodstream infections and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years commencing
upon revenue generation, and (ii) the $ 40,000,000
acquisition value of the exclusive license for I/ONTAK (denileukin diftitox), which
is a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”), a rare form of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of twelve years commencing upon revenue generation.
Goodwill of $ 9,346,796
represents the value of
LMB’s industry relationships and its assembled workforce. Goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for
impairment.
Citius is subject to a number of risks common
to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, risks related to the development by Citius or its competitors
of research and development stage product candidates, market acceptance of its product candidates that might be approved, competition
from larger companies, dependence on key personnel, dependence on key suppliers and strategic partners, the Company’s ability to
obtain additional financing and the Company’s compliance with governmental and other regulations.
Basis of Presentation and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation  — The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, LMB, and Citius Acq., and its majority-owned subsidiary NoveCite. Citius Acq. was inactive until April 1,
2022. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion
of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the condensed consolidated
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. The operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
5
Use of Estimates  — Our accounting
principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Estimates having relatively higher significance include the accounting for in-process research and development and goodwill
impairment, stock-based compensation, valuation of warrants, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and changes
in estimates may occur.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share  —
Basic and diluted net loss per common share applicable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders
in each period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during such period. For the periods presented, common
stock equivalents, consisting of stock options and warrants, were not included in the calculation of the diluted loss per share because
they were anti-dilutive.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In October
2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities.  Under the new guidance (ASC 805-20-30-28), the acquirer should determine what contract assets and/or contract liabilities
it would have recorded under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 (the revenue guidance) as of the acquisition date,
as if the acquirer had entered into the original contract at the same date and on the same terms as the acquiree. The recognition and
measurement of those contract assets and contract liabilities will likely be comparable to what the acquiree has recorded on its books
under ASC 606 as of the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2021-08 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Early adoption is
permitted, including in an interim period, for any period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. However, adoption in
an interim period other than the first fiscal quarter requires an entity to apply the new guidance to all prior business combinations
that have occurred since the beginning of the annual period in which the new guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating
the adoption date of ASU 2021-08 and the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations.
2. LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEMENT’S PLAN
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company experienced negative cash flows from operations of $ 4,824,439
for the three months ended December 31,
2022. As a result of the Company’s common stock offerings and common stock warrant exercises during the year ended September 30,
2021, the Company had working capital of approximately $ 37,800,000
at December 31, 2022. The Company estimates that its available cash
resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through February 2024.
The Company has generated no operating revenue
to date and has principally raised capital through the issuance of debt and equity instruments to finance its operations. However, the
Company’s continued operations
beyond February 2024 , including its development plans
for I/ONTAK, Mino-Lok, Mino-Wrap, Halo-Lido and NoveCite, will depend on its ability to obtain regulatory approval to market I/ONTAK and/or
Mino-Lok and generate substantial revenue from the sale of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok and on its ability to raise additional capital through
various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, strategic relationships, or out-licensing of its product candidates.
However, the Company can provide no assurances on regulatory approval, commercialization, or future sales of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok or
that financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient
capital, find strategic partners or generate substantial revenue from the sale of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok, there would be a material adverse
effect on its business. Further, the Company expects in the future to incur additional expenses as it continues to develop its product
candidates, including seeking regulatory approval, and protecting its intellectual property.

3. PATENT AND TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENTS
Patent and Technology License Agreement
– Mino-Lok
LMB has a patent and technology license agreement
with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc. (“NAT”) to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive, worldwide sub
licensable basis, as amended. LMB pays an annual maintenance fee each June until commercial sales of a product subject to the license
commence. The Company recorded an annual maintenance fee of $ 90,000
in June 2022 and 2021.
LMB will also pay annual royalties on net sales
of licensed products, with royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low double digits. In limited circumstances in which the
licensed product is not subject to a valid patent claim and a competitor is selling a competing product, the royalty rate is in the low-
to mid-single digits. After a commercial sale is obtained, LMB must pay minimum aggregate annual royalties of $ 100,000
in the first commercial
year which is prorated for a less than 12-month period, increasing $ 25,000
per year to a maximum of $ 150,000
annually. LMB must also pay
NAT up to an aggregate of $ 1,100,000
upon achieving specified regulatory and sales milestones. Finally, LMB must pay NAT a specified percentage
of payments received from any sub-licensees.
Unless earlier terminated by NAT, based on the
failure to achieve certain development and commercial milestones, the license agreement remains in effect until the date that all patents
licensed under the agreement have expired and all patent applications within the licensed patent rights have been cancelled, withdrawn,
or expressly abandoned.
Patent and Technology License Agreement
– Mino-Wrap
On January 2, 2019, we entered into a patent and
technology license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center (“Licensor”), whereby we in-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the patented technology for any and all uses
relating to breast implants. We intend to develop Mino-Wrap as a liquefying gel-based wrap containing minocycline and rifampin for the
reduction of infections associated with breast implants following breast reconstructive surgeries. We are required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones associated with these regulatory
options leading to an approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
Under the license agreement, the Company paid
an annual maintenance fee of $ 60,000
and $ 45,000
in January 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The annual maintenance fee increases by $15,000
per year up to a maximum of $90,000. Annual maintenance fees cease on the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of
$2.1 million in milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of
the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty of mid- to upper-single digit percentages of net sales, depending on the amount of annual
sales, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product
in the United States at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment of $100,000 that
will increase annually by $25,000 for the duration of the term.
We will be responsible for all patent expenses incurred by Licensor for
the term of the agreement although Licensor is responsible for the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents. Unless earlier
terminated by Licensor, based upon the failure by us to achieve certain development and commercial milestones or for various breaches
by us, the agreement expires on the later of the expiration of the patents or
January 2, 2034 .
License Agreement with Novellus
On October 6, 2020, our subsidiary, NoveCite,
signed an exclusive license agreement with subsidiary of Novellus Inc. (“Novellus”). Upon execution of the license agreement,
we paid $ 5,000,000
to Novellus, which was charged to research and development expense during the year ended September 30, 2021, and issued
Novellus shares of NoveCite’s common stock representing
25 % of the outstanding equity. We own the other
75 % of NoveCite’s
outstanding equity. Pursuant to the terms of the original stock subscription agreement between Novellus and NoveCite, if NoveCite issued
additional equity, subject to certain exceptions, NoveCite had to maintain Novellus’s ownership at
25 % by issuing additional shares
to Novellus.
In July 2021, Novellus was acquired by Brooklyn
ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. (“Brooklyn”). In connection with that transaction, the stock subscription agreement between Novellus
and NoveCite was amended to assign to Brooklyn all of Novellus’s right, title, and interest in the stock subscription agreement
and delete the anti-dilution protection and replace it with a right of first refusal whereby Brooklyn will have the right to purchase
all or a portion of the securities that NoveCite intends to sell or in the alternative, at the option of NoveCite, Brooklyn may purchase
that amount of the securities proposed to be sold by NoveCite to allow Brooklyn to maintain its then percentage ownership. In October
2022, Brooklyn changed its name to Eterna Therapeutics Inc. (“Eterna”).

Citius is responsible for the operational activities
of NoveCite and bears all costs necessary to operate NoveCite. Citius’s officers are also the officers of NoveCite and oversee the
business strategy and operations of NoveCite. As such, NoveCite is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary with a noncontrolling interest.
Eterna has no contractual rights in the profits
or obligations to share in the losses of NoveCite, and the Company has not allocated any losses to the noncontrolling interest.
NoveCite is obligated to pay Novellus up to $51,000,000
upon the achievement of various regulatory and developmental milestones. NoveCite also must pay a royalty equal to low double-digit percentages
of net sales, commencing upon the sale of a licensed product. This royalty is subject to downward adjustment to an upper-single digit
percentage of net sales in any country in the event of the expiration of the last valid patent claim or if no valid patent claim exists
in that country. The royalty will end on the earlier of (i) the date on which a biosimilar product is first marketed, sold, or distributed
in the applicable country or (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim in that country.
In the case of a country where no licensed patent ever exists, the royalty will end on the later of (i) the date of expiry of such licensed
product’s regulatory exclusivity and (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product
in the applicable country. In addition, NoveCite will pay to Eterna an amount equal to a mid-twenties percentage of any sublicensee fees
it receives.
Under the terms of the license agreement, if Eterna
receives any revenue involving the original cell line included in the licensed technology, then Eterna shall remit to NoveCite
50 % of
such revenue.
The term of the license agreement continues on
a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party
may terminate the license agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material default. NoveCite may terminate the license
agreement at any time without cause upon 90 days prior written notice.
Eterna will be responsible for preparing, filing,
prosecuting, and maintaining all patent applications and patents included in the licensed patents in the territory, provided however,
that if Eterna decides that it is not interested in maintaining a particular licensed patent or in preparing, filing, or prosecuting a
licensed patent, NoveCite will have the right, but not the obligation, to assume such responsibilities in the territory at NoveCite’s
sole cost and expense.
License Agreement with Eisai
In September 2021, the Company entered into a
definitive agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories SA, a subsidiary of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (collectively, “Dr. Reddy’s”)
to acquire its exclusive license of I/ONTAK (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare
form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Under the terms of this
agreement, Citius acquired Dr. Reddy’s exclusive license of I/ONTAK from Eisai Co., Ltd. (“Eisai”) and other related assets
owned by Dr. Reddy’s. Citius’s exclusive license include rights to develop and commercialize I/ONTAK in all markets except for Japan and
certain parts of Asia. Additionally, Citius retained an option on the right to develop and market the product in India. Eisai retains
exclusive development and marketing rights for denileukin diftitox in Japan and most Asian countries.
Citius paid $40 million upfront
payment which represents the acquisition date fair value of the in-process research and development acquired from Dr. Reddy’s. Dr.
Reddy’s is entitled to up to $40 million in development milestone payments related to CTCL approvals in the U.S. and other markets,
up to $70 million in development milestones for additional indications, as well as commercial milestone payments and low double-digit
tiered royalties on net product sales, and up to $300 million for commercial sales milestones. We also must pay on a fiscal quarter basis
tiered royalties equal to low double-digit percentages of net product sales. The royalties will end on the earlier of (i) the 15-year
anniversary of the first commercial sale of the latest indication that received regulatory approval in the applicable country and (ii)
the date on which a biosimilar product results in the reduction of net sales in the applicable product by 50% in two consecutive quarters,
as compared to the four quarters prior to the first commercial sale of the biosimilar product.
We will also pay to Dr. Reddy’s an
amount equal to a low-thirties percentage of any sublicense upfront consideration or milestone payments (or the like) received by us and
the greater of (i) a low-thirties percentage of any sublicensee sales-based royalties or (ii) a mid-single digit percentage of such licensee’s
net sales.
8
Under the license agreement, Eisai is to receive
a $6.0 million development milestone payment upon initial approval and additional commercial milestone payments related to the achievement
of net product sales thresholds (which increases to $7 million in the event we have exercised our option to add India to the licensed
territory prior to FDA approval) and an aggregate of up to $22 million related to the achievement of net product sales thresholds. We
also are required to reimburse Eisai for up to $2.65 million of its costs to complete the ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for I/ONTAK
for the CTCL indication and reimburse Eisai for all reasonable costs associated with the preparation of a biologics license application
(“BLA”) for I/ONTAK.
Eisai will be responsible for completing the current CTCL clinical trial, and chemistry, manufacturing,
and controls (CMC) activities through the filing of the BLA for I/ONTAK with the FDA (which was filed in September 2022). Citius will
be responsible for development costs associated with potential additional indications.
The term of the license
agreement will continue until (i) if there has not been a commercial sale of a licensed product in the territory, until the 10-year anniversary
of the original license effective date, March 30, 2016, or (ii) if there has been a first commercial sale of a licensed product in the
territory within the 10-year anniversary of the original license effective date, the 10-year anniversary of the first commercial sale
on a country-by-country basis. The term of the license may be extended for additional 10-year periods for all countries in the territory
by notifying Eisai and paying an extension fee equal to $10 million.
Either party may terminate the license agreement upon written notice
if the other party is in material breach of the agreement, subject to cure within the designated time periods. Either party also may terminate
the license agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party files for bankruptcy or takes related actions or is unable to
pay its debts as they become due. Additionally, either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party directly
or indirectly challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patent.
Also under the agreement with Dr. Reddy’s,
we are required to (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to make commercially available products in the CTCL indication,
(ii) initiate
two investigator initiated immuno-oncology trials (which we initiated in June 2021 and September 2022, respectively), (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to achieve each of the approval milestones, and (iv) complete each specified immuno-oncology investigator trial on
or before the four-year anniversary of the effective date of the definitive agreement. Additionally, we are required to commercially launch
a product in a territory within six months of receiving regulatory approval for such product in each such jurisdiction.

5. OPERATING LEASE
Effective July 1, 2019, Citius entered into a
76-month lease for office space in Cranford, NJ. Citius pays its proportionate share of real estate taxes and operating expenses in excess
of the base year expenses. These costs are variable lease payments and are not included in the determination of the lease’s right-of-use
asset or lease liability.
The Company identified and assessed the following
significant assumptions in recognizing its right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities:
●
As the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate in calculating the present value of the lease payments based on the remaining lease term as of the adoption date.
●
Since the Company elected to account for each lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single combined component, all contract consideration was allocated to the combined lease component.
●
The expected lease terms include noncancelable lease periods.
The elements of lease expense are as follows:

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 should be read together with our unaudited
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and in conjunction with the audited financial statements
of Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. The following discussion
contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual
results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number
of factors. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary
from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
on page ii of this Report.
Historical Background
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company
dedicated to the development and commercialization of first-in-class critical care products with a focus on oncology, anti-infectives
in adjunct cancer care, unique prescription products and stem cell therapies. On September 12, 2014, we acquired Citius Pharmaceuticals,
LLC as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
On March 30, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Leonard-Meron Biosciences, Inc. (“LMB”) by issuing shares of our common stock. We acquired identifiable intangible
assets of $19,400,000 related to in-process research and development and recorded goodwill of $9,346,796 for the excess of the purchase
consideration over the net assets acquired.
On September 11, 2020, we formed NoveCite, Inc.
(“NoveCite”), a Delaware corporation, of which we own 75% of the issued and outstanding capital stock.
On August 23, 2021, we formed Citius Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary, which began operations in April 2022.
In-process research and development of $19,400,000
represents the value of LMB’s drug candidate Mino-Lok, which is an antibiotic solution used to treat catheter-related bloodstream
infections and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years commencing upon revenue generation. Goodwill
of $9,346,796 represents the value of LMB’s industry relationships and its assembled workforce. Goodwill will not be amortized but
will be tested at least annually for impairment. In-process research and development of $40,000,000 represents the value of our September
2021 acquisition of an exclusive license for I/ONTAK (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL,
a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of twelve years commencing
upon revenue generation.
Through December 31, 2022, we have devoted substantially
all our efforts to product development, raising capital, building infrastructure through strategic alliances and coordinating activities
relating to our proprietary products. We have not yet realized any revenues from our operations.
Patent and Technology License Agreements
Mino-Lok®
- LMB has a patent and technology
license agreement with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc. (“NAT”) to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive,
worldwide sub-licensable basis, as amended. Since May 2014, LMB has paid an annual maintenance fee, which began at $30,000 and that increased
over five years to $90,000, where it will remain until the commencement of commercial sales of a product subject to the license. LMB will
also pay annual royalties on net sales of licensed products, with royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low double digits.
In limited circumstances in which the licensed product is not subject to a valid patent claim and a competitor is selling a competing
product, the royalty rate is in the low single digits. After a commercial sale is obtained, LMB must pay minimum aggregate annual royalties
that increase in subsequent years. LMB must also pay NAT up to $1,100,000 upon achieving specified regulatory and sales milestones. Finally,
LMB must pay NAT a specified percentage of payments received from any sub licensees.
14
Mino-Wrap
- On January 2, 2019, we entered
into a patent and technology license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of the University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (“Licensor”), whereby we in-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the patented technology
for any and all uses relating to breast implants. We intend to develop Mino-Wrap as a liquefying gel-based wrap containing minocycline
and rifampin for the reduction of infections associated with breast implants following breast reconstructive surgeries. We are required
to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones associated
with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA.
Under the license agreement, we paid a nonrefundable
upfront payment of $125,000. We are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $30,000, commencing in January 2020 that increases annually
by $15,000 per year up to a maximum of $90,000. Annual maintenance fees cease on the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an
aggregate of $2.1 million in milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under
the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty of mid- to upper-single digit percentages of net sales, depending on the
amount of annual sales, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent
for the product in the United States at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment
of $100,000 that will increase annually by $25,000 for the duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses incurred
by Licensor for the term of the agreement although Licensor is responsible for filing, prosecution, and maintenance of all patents.
NoveCite
– On October 6, 2020, our
subsidiary NoveCite entered into a license agreement with Novellus Therapeutics Limited (“Novellus”), whereby NoveCite acquired
an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to develop and commercialize a stem cell therapy based on the Novelllus’s
patented technology for the treatment of acute pneumonitis of any etiology in which inflammation is a major agent in humans. Upon execution
of the license agreement, NoveCite paid an upfront payment of $5,000,000 to Novellus issued to Novellus shares of Novecite’s common
stock representing 25% of NoveCite’s currently outstanding equity. We own the other 75% of NoveCite’s currently outstanding
equity.
In July 2021, Novellus was acquired by Brooklyn
ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. (“Brooklyn”). Pursuant to this transaction, the NoveCite license was assumed by Brooklyn with all
original terms and conditions. In October 2021, Brooklyn changed its name to Eterna Therapeutics Inc.
As part of the Novellus and Brooklyn merger transaction,
the 25% non-dilutive position as per the subscription agreement between Novellus and NoveCite was removed.
Under the license agreement, NoveCite is obligated
to pay Novellus up to an aggregate of $51,000,000 in regulatory and developmental milestone payments. NoveCite also must pay a royalty
equal to low double-digit percentages of net sales, commencing upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product. This royalty is subject
to downward adjustment on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis to an upper-single digit percentage of net sales in any country
in the event of the expiration of the last valid patent claim or if no valid patent claim exists in that country. The royalty will end
on the earlier of (i) date on which a biosimilar product is first marketed, sold, or distributed by Novellus or any third party in the
applicable country or (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim in that country.
In the case of a country where no licensed patent ever exists, the royalty will end on the later of (i) the date of expiry of such licensed
product’s regulatory exclusivity and (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product
in the applicable country. In addition, NoveCite will pay to Novellus an amount equal to a mid-twenties percentage of any sublicensee
fees it receives.
Under the terms of the license agreement, in the
event that Novellus receives any revenue involving the original cell line included in the licensed technology, then Novellus shall remit
to NoveCite 50% of such revenue.
I/ONTAK
- In September 2021, the Company
entered into a definitive agreement with Dr. Reddy’s to acquire its exclusive license of I/ONTAK (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology
immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Under the terms of this agreement, Citius acquired
Dr. Reddy’s exclusive license of I/ONTAL from Eisai and other related assets owned by Dr. Reddy’s. Citius’s exclusive license rights include
rights to develop and commercialize I/ONTAK in all markets except for Japan and certain parts of Asia. Additionally, Citius has an option

Revenues
We did not generate any revenues for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Research and Development Expenses
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
research and development expenses were $3,445,515 as compared to $5,457,849 during the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease
of $2,012,334.
Research and development costs for Mino-Lok increased
by $192,002 to $1,167,655 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $975,653 for the three months ended December 31,
2021, due primarily to increased costs associated with the addition of Biorasi, LLC (“Biorasi”), a global clinical research
organization (CRO), to help expand the Company’s Phase 3 Mino-Lok trial to additional sites outside the United States.
Research and development costs for Halo-Lido decreased
by $229,051 to $768,526 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $997,577 for the three months ended December 31, 2021
due to start-up costs associated with the Phase 2b trial incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Research and development costs for I/ONTAK were
$934,284 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $2,937,795 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $2,003,511
decrease in expenses was primarily due to the completion and filing of our BLA with the FDA in September 2022.
We expect that research and development expenses
will stabilize in fiscal 2023 as we focus on the commercialization of I/ONTAK, and complete our Phase 3 trial for Mino-Lok and our Phase
2b trial for Halo-Lido.
16
General and Administrative Expenses
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
general and administrative expenses were $2,603,287 as compared to $2,896,749 during the three months ended December 31, 2021. General
and administrative expenses decreased by $293,462 in comparison with the prior period. The primary reasons for the decrease were reduced
costs for performance bonuses and investor relations expenses. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in payroll expenses
for new employees. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, professional fees for legal, regulatory,
accounting, and corporate development services, and investor relations expenses.
Stock-based Compensation Expense
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
stock-based compensation expense was $1,201,081 as compared to $904,604 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation includes $33,333 in expense for the NoveCite stock option plan. Stock-based
compensation expense for the most recently completed quarter increased by $296,477 in comparison to the prior period primarily due to
new grants made to employees (including new hires), directors and consultants.
Other Income
Interest income for the three months ended December
31, 2022 was $214,549 as compared to interest income of $33,982 for the prior period. The increase is due to higher interest rates on
the investment of the remaining proceeds of our early 2021 equity offerings and common stock warrant exercises in money market accounts.
Other income for the three months ended December
31, 2022 consists of the $3,585,689 gain recognized in connection with the sale of certain New Jersey income tax net operating losses
to a third party under the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program.
Income Taxes
The Company recorded deferred income tax expense
of $144,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, related to the amortization for taxable purposes of its in-process research
and development asset. There was no provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to the Company’s
operating losses and the valuation reserve on deferred tax assets.
Net Loss
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
we incurred a net loss of $3,593,645, compared to a net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $9,225,220. The $5,631,575
decrease in the net loss was primarily due to the increase of $3,766,256 in other income and the $2,012,334 decrease in research and development
expenses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity and Working Capital
Citius has incurred operating losses since inception
and incurred a net loss of $3,593,645 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, Citius had an accumulated deficit
of $133,282,112. Citius’ net cash used in operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $4,824,439.
As a result of the Company’s common stock
offerings and common stock warrant exercises during the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company had working capital of approximately
$37,800,000 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, Citius had cash and cash equivalents of $36,887,251 available to fund its operations.
The Company’s primary sources of cash flow since inception have been from financing activities. Our primary uses of operating cash
were for in-licensing of intellectual property, product development and commercialization activities, employee compensation, consulting
fees, legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations expenses.
Based on our cash and cash equivalents at December
31, 2022, we expect that we will have sufficient funds to continue our operations through February 2024. We expect to need to raise additional
capital in the future to support our operations beyond February 2024. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising
the needed capital or that the proceeds will be received in an amount or in a timely manner to support our operations.
Inflation
Our management believes that inflation has not
had a material effect on our results of operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.
We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our critical accounting policies and use of estimates
are discussed in, and should be read in conjunction with, the annual consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures

Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods
and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
Our Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal
executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
as of December 31, 2022. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.
As of December 31, 2022, based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Changes In Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
