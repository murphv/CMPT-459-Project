Summary of Significant Accounting Policies B ASIS
OF
P RESENTATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations; however, in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting of adjustments of a normal recurring nature, necessary for fair presentation. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2022 which are contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 16, 2022. The results for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation . All references to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 are to the quarter ended December 30, 2022. There were 13 weeks during the second quarters ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were 26 weeks during the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. U SE
OF
E STIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. B USINESS
C OMBINATIONS The Company utilizes the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805,
Business Combinations , (“ASC 805”), for all transactions and events in which it obtains control over one or more other businesses, to recognize the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired, even if less than one hundred percent ownership is acquired, and in establishing the acquisition date fair value as the measurement date for all assets and liabilities assumed. The Company also utilizes ASC 805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. 7 F OREIGN  C URRENCY Local currencies are the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Canada. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity. Gains (losses) resulting from non-U.S. currency transactions are included in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and were immaterial for all periods presented. A CCOUNTS
R ECEIVABLE Accounts receivable, net, represents amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended as necessary. The allowance is based upon an assessment of the customer's credit worthiness, reasonable forecasts about the future, history with the customer, and the age of the receivable balance. The Company typically invoices a customer upon shipment of the product (or completion of a service) for contracts where revenue is recognized at a point in time. For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, the invoicing events are typically based on specified performance obligation deliverables or milestone events, or quantifiable measures of performance. A CCOUNTS
R ECEIVABLES
F ACTORING On September 27, 2022, the Company executed an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement (“RPA”) with Bank of the West, as purchaser, pursuant to which the Company may offer to sell certain customer receivables, subject to the terms and conditions of the RPA. The RPA is an uncommitted arrangement such that the Company is not obligated to sell any receivables and Bank of the West has no obligation to purchase any receivables from the Company. Pursuant to the RPA, Bank of the West may purchase certain of the Company's customer receivables at a discounted rate, subject to a limit that as of any date, the total amount of purchased receivables held by Bank of the West, less the amount of all collections received on such receivables, may not exceed $20,000. The RPA has an indefinite term and the agreement remains in effect until it is terminated by either party. Factoring under the RPA Agreement is treated as a true sale of accounts receivable by the Company. The Company has continued involvement in servicing accounts receivable under the Purchase Agreement, but no retained interests related to the factored accounts receivable.
Proceeds for amounts factored by the Company are recorded as an increase to cash and a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flows attributable to factoring are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Factoring fees are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company factored accounts receivables and incurred factoring fees of approximately $ 20,000
and $138, respectively for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022. The Company did not factor any accounts receivable or incur any factoring fees for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021.
D ERIVATIVES The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial instruments in its condensed consolidated financial statements in Other non-current assets, or Other non-current liabilities depending on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of Other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the impact of the hedged transaction when the underlying contract matures and, for interest rate exposure derivatives, over the term of the corresponding debt instrument. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings as they occur. All derivatives for the Company qualified for hedge accounting as of December 30, 2022. R EVENUE
R ECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers , (“ASC 606”). Revenues are derived from the sales of products that are grouped into one of the following three categories: (i) components; (ii) modules and sub-assemblies; and (iii) integrated subsystems. The Company also generates revenues from the performance of services, including systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. Each promised good or service within a contract is accounted for separately under the guidance of ASC 606 if they are distinct. Promised goods or services not meeting the criteria for being a distinct performance obligation are bundled into a single
8 performance obligation with other goods or services that together meet the criteria for being distinct. The appropriate allocation of the transaction price and recognition of revenue is then determined for the bundled performance obligation. Revenue recognized at a point in time generally relates to contracts that include a combination of components, modules and sub-assemblies, integrated subsystems and related system integration or other services. Contracts with distinct performance obligations recognized at a point in time, with or without an allocation of the transaction price, totaled
44 % and
40 % of revenues for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022, respectively. Contracts with distinct performance obligations recognized at a point in time, with or without an allocation of the transaction price, totaled
52 % and
49 % for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
The Company also engages in over time contracts for development, production and service activities and recognizes revenue for performance obligations over time. These over time contracts involve the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex modules and sub-assemblies or integrated subsystems and related services. Over time contracts include both fixed-price and cost reimbursable contracts. The Company’s cost reimbursable contracts typically include cost-plus fixed fee and time and material contracts. Total revenue recognized over time was
56 % and
60 % of total revenues for the second quarters and six months ended December 30, 2022, respectively. Total revenue recognized over time was
48 % and
51 % of total revenues for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company generally does not provide its customers with rights of product return other than those related to assurance warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods over a period of
12
to
36
months. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment. The Company does not consider activities related to such assurance warranties, if any, to be a separate performance obligation. The Company does offer separately priced extended warranties which generally range from
12
to
36
months that are treated as separate performance obligations. The transaction price allocated to extended warranties is recognized over time in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.
The Company's contracts generally do not include significant financing components. The Company's over time contracts may include milestone payments, which align the payment schedule with the progress towards completion on the performance obligation. Otherwise, the Company's contracts are predicated on payment upon completion of the performance obligation. On certain contracts, the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment, which is not considered a significant financing component because most contracts have a duration of approximately two years on average and it is used to facilitate inventory demands at the onset of a contract and to safeguard the Company from the failure of the other party to abide by some or all of their obligations under the contract. All revenues are reported net of government assessed taxes (e.g., sales taxes or value-added taxes). Refer to Note M for disaggregation of revenue for the period. C ONTRACT
B ALANCES      Contract balances result from the timing of revenue recognized, billings and cash collections resulting in the generation of contract assets and liabilities. Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced to the customer and the right to payment is not subject to the passage of time. Instead, while the Company has an enforceable right to payment as progress is made over performance obligations, billings to customers are generally predicated on (i) completion of defined milestones, (ii) monthly costs incurred or (iii) final delivery of goods or services. Contract assets are presented as Unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities consist of deferred product revenue, billings in excess of revenues, deferred service revenue and customer advances. Deferred product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because the Company has not satisfied its performance obligations under the contract. Billings in excess of revenues represents milestone billing contracts where the billings of the contract exceed recognized revenues. Deferred service revenue primarily represents amounts invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts or extended warranty contracts, which are recognized over time in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order. Contract liabilities are included in deferred revenue as well as Other non-current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract balances are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis. The contract asset balances were $ 333,491
and $ 303,356
as of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The contract asset balance increased due to growth in revenue recognized under over time contracts, as well as the timing of program milestone billings during the second quarter ended December 30, 2022. The contract liability balances were $ 39,888
and $ 15,966
as of December 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The increase was due to a higher volume of advance milestone billing events as well as timing of revenue conversion across multiple programs. 9 Revenue recognized for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022 that was included in the contract liability balance at July 1, 2022 was $ 3,068
and $ 7,737 , respectively. Revenue recognized for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance at July 2, 2021 was $ 5,151
and $ 18,288 , respectively. R EMAINING
P ERFORMANCE
O BLIGATIONS The Company includes in its computation of remaining performance obligations customer orders for which it has accepted signed sales orders. The definition of remaining performance obligations excludes contracts with original expected durations of less than one year, as well as those contracts that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate the order with no substantial penalty, even if the Company’s historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is remote. As of December 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $ 580,318 . The Company expects to recognize approximately
64 % of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next 12 months and the balance thereafter. L ONG -L IVED
A SSETS Long-lived assets primarily include property and equipment, intangible assets and ROU assets. The Company regularly evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with ASC 360,
Property, Plant and Equipment
(“ASC 360”). The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. As part of the Company's assessment over the future benefit of certain long-lived assets in the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, the Company identified an immaterial correction of an error in the useful lives assigned to certain leasehold improvements resulting in a cumulative adjustment to depreciation expense of $ 3.1  million recorded during the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments in this ASU address diversity and inconsistency related to the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination and require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under Topic 606. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 10 R ECENTLY

13 D. Fair Value of Financial Instruments   Fair Value Measurements   December 30, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities: Interest rate swap $ 220   $ —   $ 220   $ —   Total $ 220   $ —   $ 220   $ —   The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, restricted cash, accounts receivable and payable, contract assets and liabilities and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The Company determined the carrying value of long-term debt approximated fair value due to variable interest rates charged on the borrowings, which reprice frequently. During the first quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate hedging agreement (the “Swap”). Refer to Note O for further information regarding the Swap. The fair value of the Swap is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivative, leveraging observable inputs other than quoted prices, such as interest rates. As of December 30, 2022, the fair value of the Swap was a liability of $ 220
and is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. E.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value, and consists of materials, labor and overhead. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value. Once an item is written down, the value becomes the new inventory cost basis. The Company reduces the value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand inventory in excess of estimated usage. The excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, historical usage, product mix and possible alternative uses.
Inventory was comprised of the following: As of December 30, 2022 July 1, 2022 Raw materials $ 199,710   $ 178,410   Work in process 76,830   64,287   Finished goods 35,436   27,642   Total $ 311,976   $ 270,339   F. Goodwill In accordance with FASB ASC 350,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
(“ASC 350”), the Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results of the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. Component level financial information is reviewed by management across
two
divisions: Mission Systems and Microelectronics. Accordingly, these were determined to be the Company's reporting units.
The following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amount of goodw ill for the six months ended December 30, 2022 : Total Balance at July 1, 2022 $ 937,880   Goodwill adjustment for the Avalex acquisition 66   Goodwill adjustment for the Atlanta Micro acquisition 147   Balance at December 30, 2022 $ 938,093   The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. 14 G. Restructuring During the second quarter ended and six months ended December 30, 2022, the Company incurred $ 2,069
and $ 3,577
of restructuring and other charges, respectively. The Company incurs restructuring and other charges in connection with management's decision to undertake certain actions to realign operating expenses through workforce reductions and the closure of certain Company facilities, businesses and product lines. The Company's adjustments reflected in restructuring and other charges are typically related to acquisitions and organizational redesign programs initiated as part of discrete post acquisition integration activities. Consistent with the Company's definition of restructuring and other charges, 1MPACT is an organizational redesign program initiated on the heels of a series of acquisitions since 2014 rather than a single, discrete acquisition. Since the inception of 1MPACT, the Company has selectively engaged with leading consultants to accelerate solution design and implementation for the highest value workstreams. These costs are associated with this discrete transformation initiative and are non-routine and may not be indicative of ongoing results. Restructuring and other charges for the second quarter ended December 30, 2022 primarily related to 1MPACT including $ 1,039
of costs for facility optimization efforts, including $ 783
related to lease asset impairment, $ 595
of severance costs, as well as $ 435
of third-party consulting costs.
Restructuring and other charges for the six months ended December 30, 2022 primarily related to 1MPACT including $ 1,739
of third-party consulting costs, $ 1,039
of costs for facility optimization efforts, including $ 783
related to lease asset impairment, as well as $ 799
of severance costs.
All of the restructuring and other charges are classified as Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and any remaining severance obligations are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. The restructuring liability is classified as Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table presents the detail of charges included in the Company’s liability for restructuring and other charges: Severance & Related Facilities & Other Total Balance at July 1, 2022 $ 4,722   $ —   $ 4,722   Restructuring charges 799   256   1,055   Cash paid ( 4,336 ) ( 194 ) ( 4,530 ) Balance at December 30, 2022 $ 1,185   $ 62   $ 1,247   H. Income Taxes
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 2,151
and $ 155
on a loss before income taxes of $ 13,071
and $ 2,794
for the second quarters ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 3,173
and $ 596
on a loss before income taxes of $ 28,428
and $ 10,375
for the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. During the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $ 2,348
related to a release of income tax reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. During the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a tax provision of $ 1,745
and $ 878
related to stock compensation shortfalls, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarters ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development credits, non-deductible compensation, stock compensation shortfalls and state taxes. The effective tax rate for the second quarter ended December 30, 2022 also differed from the federal statutory rate due to the release of income tax reserves for previously unrecognized income tax benefits. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law which contained provisions that include a 15% corporate minimum tax effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks after December 31, 2022. The Company expects the impact of this legislation to be immaterial.
Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires companies to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditures over five years for tax purposes, and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years for tax purposes. 15 I.

a s of December 30, 2022. J. Employee Benefit Plan P ENSION
P LAN The Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) for its Swiss employees, which is administered by an independent pension fund. The Plan is mandated by Swiss law and meets the criteria for a defined benefit plan under ASC 715,  Compensation—Retirement Benefits  (“ASC 715”), because participants of the Plan are entitled to a defined rate of return on contributions made. The independent pension fund is a multi-employer plan with unrestricted joint liability for all participating companies for which the Plan’s overfunding or underfunding is allocated to each participating company based on an allocation key determined by the Plan. The Company recognizes a net asset or liability for the Plan equal to the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the Plan and the fair value of the Plan’s assets as required by ASC 715. The funded status may vary from year to year due to changes in the fair value of the Plan’s assets and variations on the underlying assumptions of the projected benefit obligation of the Plan. The Plan's funded status at December 30, 2022 was a net liability of $ 4,647 , which is recorded in Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recorded a net gain of $ 48
and $ 96
in AOCI during the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022. The Company recorded a net gain of $ 48

associated with the Plan for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company's total expected employer contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2023 are $ 1,093 . 401(k) Plan The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for its U.S. employees. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company increased the rate of its matching contributions from
3 % to
6 % of participants' eligible annual compensation and changed the form of these contributions from cash to Company stock. The Company may also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at its discretion. The Company had $ 965
of capitalized stock-based 401(k) matching compensation expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 30, 2022. Stock-based 401(k) matching compensation cost is measured based on the value of the matching amount and is recognized as expense as incurred. During the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, the Company recognized share-based matching contributions related to the 401(k) plan of $ 2,748
as compared to $ 1,711
of cash match during the second quarter ended December 31, 2021. During the six months ended December 30, 2022, the Company recognized share-based matching contributions related to the 401(k) plan of $ 6,427

On June 24, 2022, the Company amended the Rights Agreement, dated as of December 27, 2021, to increase the ownership threshold for a person to be an “Acquiring Person” (as defined in the Rights Agreement) from
7.5 % of common stock to
10 % of common stock ( 10 % of common stock to
20 % of common stock in the case of a passive institutional investor).

P LANS At December 30, 2022, the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) is
7,862
shares, including
3,000
shares approved by the Company's shareholders on October 28, 2020 and
2,000
shares approved for future grant under the 2018 Plan by the Company's shareholders on October 26, 2022. The 2018 Plan shares available for issuance also include
948
shares rolled into the 2018 Plan that were available for future grant under the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2005 Plan”). The 2018 Plan replaced the 2005 Plan. The shares authorized for issuance under the 2018 Plan will continue to be increased by any future cancellations, forfeitures or terminations (other than by exercise) of awards under the 2005 Plan. The foregoing does not affect any outstanding awards under the 2005 Plan, which remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock awards to employees and non-employees. Stock options must be granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and the options generally have a term of
seven years . There were
2,054
available shares for future grant under the 2018 Plan at December 30, 2022. As part of the Company's ongoing annual equity grant program for employees, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock awards to certain executives and employees pursuant to the 2018 Plan. Performance awards vest based on the requisite service period subject to the achievement of specific financial performance targets. Based on the performance targets, some of these awards require graded vesting which results in more rapid expense recognition compared to traditional time-based vesting over the same vesting period. The Company monitors the probability of achieving the performance targets on a quarterly basis and may adjust periodic stock compensation expense accordingly based on its determination of the likelihood for reaching targets. The performance targets generally include the achievement of internal performance targets in relation to a peer group of companies. E MPLOYEE

Operating Segment, Geographic Information and Significant Customers Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company announced its 1MPACT value creation initiative to promote scale as the organization continues to grow. The Company evaluated this internal reorganization under FASB ASC 280,
Segment Reporting
(“ASC 280”) to determine whether this change has impacted the Company's single operating and reportable segment. The Company concluded this change had no effect given the CODM continues to evaluate and manage the Company on the basis of

18 The geographic distribution of the Company’s revenues as determined by country in which the Company's legal subsidiary is domiciled is summarized as follows: U.S. Europe Asia Pacific Eliminations Total SECOND QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2022 Net revenues to unaffiliated customers $ 219,155   $ 10,431   $ 2   $ —  $ 229,588   Inter-geographic revenues ( 68 ) 168   —   ( 100 ) —  Net revenues $ 219,087   $ 10,599   $ 2   $ ( 100 ) $ 229,588   SECOND QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 Net revenues to unaffiliated customers $ 209,495   $ 10,808   $ 77   $ —  $ 220,380   Inter-geographic revenues 1,588   599   —   ( 2,187 ) —  Net revenues $ 211,083   $ 11,407   $ 77   $ ( 2,187 ) $ 220,380   SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2022 Net revenues to unaffiliated customers $ 437,977   $ 19,183   $ 7   $ —  $ 457,167   Inter-geographic revenues 79   372   —   ( 451 ) —  Net revenues $ 438,056   $ 19,555   $ 7   $ ( 451 ) $ 457,167   SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 Net revenues to unaffiliated customers $ 423,236   $ 21,995   $ 162   $ —  $ 445,393   Inter-geographic revenues 3,147   1,328   —   ( 4,475 ) —  Net revenues $ 426,383   $ 23,323   $ 162   $ ( 4,475 ) $ 445,393   The Company offers a broad family of products and processing solutions designed to meet the full range of requirements in compute-intensive, signal processing, image processing and command and control applications. To maintain a competitive advantage, the Company seeks to leverage technology investments across multiple product lines and product solutions.
The Company’s products are typically compute-intensive and require extremely high bandwidth and high throughput. These processing solutions often must also meet significant SWaP constraints for use in aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, ships and other platforms and be ruggedized for use in harsh environments. The Company's products transform the massive streams of digital data created in these applications into usable information in real time. The systems can scale from a few processors to thousands of processors. In recent years, the Company completed a series of acquisitions that augmented its technological capabilities, applications and end markets. As these acquisitions and changes occurred, the Company's proportion of revenue derived from the sale of components in different technological areas, and modules, sub-assemblies and integrated subsystems which combine technologies into more complex diverse products has shifted. The following tables present revenue consistent with the Company's strategy of expanding its technological capabilities and program content. As additional information related to the Company’s products by end user, application, product grouping and/or platform is attained, the categorization of these products can vary over time. When this occurs, the Company reclassifies revenue by end user, application, product grouping and/or platform for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the underlying trends of results within each revenue category. The following table presents the Company's net revenue by end user for the periods presented:   Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Domestic (1) $ 204,959   $ 186,592   $ 410,789   $ 375,840   International/Foreign Military Sales (2) 24,629   33,788   46,378   69,553   Total Net Revenue $ 229,588   $ 220,380   $ 457,167   $ 445,393   (1) Domestic revenues consist of sales where the end user is within the U.S., as well as sales to prime defense contractor customers where the ultimate end user location is not defined.  (2) International/Foreign Military Sales consist of sales to U.S. prime defense contractor customers where the end user is outside the U.S., foreign military sales through the U.S. government and direct sales to non-U.S. based customers intended for end use outside of the U.S. 19 The following table presents the Company's net revenue by end application for the periods presented: Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Radar (1) $ 43,707   $ 51,172   $ 97,115   $ 110,076   Electronic Warfare (2) 33,718   32,369   68,807   66,310   Other Sensor & Effector (3) 29,333   22,164   50,536   53,606   Total Sensor & Effector 106,758   105,705   216,458   229,992   C4I (4) 103,735   90,931   198,866   174,332   Other (5) 19,095   23,744   41,843   41,069   Total Net Revenue $ 229,588   $ 220,380   $ 457,167   $ 445,393   (1) Radar includes end-use applications where radio frequency signals are utilized to detect, track and identify objects.

(2) Modules and sub-assemblies combine multiple components to serve a range of complex functions, including processing, networking and graphics display. Typically delivered as computer boards or other packaging, modules and sub-assemblies are usually designed using open standards to provide interoperability when integrated in a subsystem. Examples of modules and sub-assemblies include embedded processing boards, switched fabrics and boards for high-speed input/output, digital receivers, graphics and video, along with multi-chip modules, integrated radio frequency and microwave multi-function assemblies and radio frequency tuners and transceivers. (3) Integrated subsystems bring components, modules and/or sub-assemblies into one system, enabled with software. Subsystems are typically, but not always, integrated within an open standards-based chassis and often feature interconnect technologies to enable communication between disparate systems. Spares and replacement modules and sub-assemblies are provided for use with subsystems sold by the Company. The Company’s subsystems are deployed in sensor processing, aviation and mission computing and C4I applications. The following table presents the Company's net revenue by platform for the periods presented: Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Airborne (1) $ 119,944   $ 110,990   $ 238,294   $ 227,554   Land (2) 26,735   25,976   60,667   61,833   Naval (3) 31,204   34,236   64,939   74,213   Other (4) 51,705   49,178   93,267   81,793   Total Net Revenues $ 229,588   $ 220,380   $ 457,167   $ 445,393   (1) Airborne platform includes products that relate to personnel, equipment or pieces of equipment designed for airborne applications.

Customers comprising 10% or more of the Company’s revenues for the periods shown are as follows:   Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Lockheed Martin Corporation 12   % * 14   % 10   % Raytheon Technologies 12   % 15   % 12   % 15   % U.S. Navy 11   % 14   % 11   % 15   % Northrop Grumman 11   % 10   % 10   % * 46   % 39   % 47   % 40   % *    Indicates that the amount is less than 10% of the Company's revenue for the respective period. While the Company typically has customers from which it derives 10% or more of its revenue, the sales to each of these customers are spread across multiple programs and platforms. There were no programs comprising 10% or more of the Company's revenues for the second quarters and six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. N. Commitments and Contingencies L EGAL
C LAIMS The Company is subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against the Company and intends to defend itself vigorously. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations, or financial position.
In June 2021, Embedded Reps of America, LLC (“ERA”), a former sales representative, and James Mazzola, a principal of ERA, filed for binding arbitration related to the termination of ERA’s sales representative agreement raising multiple claims that aggregate to approximately $ 9,000
in direct damages, with treble damages requested on a number of those claims. ERA was a sales representative of Themis Computer (“Themis”) when Themis was acquired by Mercury. The sales representative agreement provided for termination by either party upon 30 days written notice with ERA entitled to commissions for orders obtained by ERA with product shipment occurring prior to termination. The Company responded to the complaint in July 2021. An arbitration proceeding was held during September 2022, with final motions in October 2022 and oral arguments in November 2022. The arbitrator issued its final ruling in January 2023, awarding ERA $72 in damages and fees.
In December 2021, counsel for National Technical Systems, Inc. (“NTS”) sent the Company an environmental demand letter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A, and CERCLA 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, related to a site that NTS formerly owned at 533 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts. NTS received a Notice of Responsibility from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”) alleging trichloroethene, freon and 1,4-dioxane contamination in the groundwater emanating from NTS’s former site. NTS alleges in its demand letter that the operations of a predecessor company to Mercury that was acquired in the Company’s acquisition of the Microsemi carve-out business that once owned and operated a facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts contributed to the groundwater contamination. NTS is seeking payment by the Company of NTS’s costs for any required environmental remediation. In April 2022, the Company engaged in a meet and confer session with NTS pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A to discuss the status of the environmental review performed by NTS and its licensed site professional. In addition, in November 2021, the Company responded to a request for information from MassDEP regarding the detection of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroakyl substances) in the Acton, Massachusetts Water District’s Conant public water supply wells near the former facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts at a level above the standard that MassDEP published for PFAS in October 2020. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, the Company may have for these matters. 21 I NDEMNIFICATION
O BLIGATIONS The Company’s standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to the Company’s products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited. P URCHASE
C OMMITMENTS As of December 30, 2022, the Company has entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components and services used in its normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate
to
$ 142,932 . O THER As part of the Company's strategy for growth, the Company continues to explore acquisitions or strategic alliances. The associated acquisition costs incurred in the form of professional fees and services may be material to the future periods in which they occur, regardless of whether the acquisition is ultimately completed. The Company may elect from time to time to purchase and subsequently retire shares of common stock in order to settle employees’ tax liabilities associated with vesting of a restricted stock award or exercise of stock options. These transactions would be treated as a use of cash in financing activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. O. Derivatives The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to mitigate interest rate exposure with respect to its financing arrangements. On September 7, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate Swap (the “initial Swap”) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) for a notional amount of $ 300,000
in order to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of the total $ 511,500
existing borrowings on the Revolver. The initial Swap agreement was designated and qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge. The initial Swap matures on February 28, 2027, coterminous with the maturity of the Revolver. The initial Swap established a fixed interest rate on the first $ 300,000
of the Company's outstanding borrowings against the Revolver obligation at
3.25 %. On September 29, 2022, the Company terminated the initial Swap. At the time of termination, the fair value of the initial Swap was an asset of $ 5,995 . The Company received the cash settlement of $ 5,995
and these proceeds are classified within Operating Activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Following the termination of the initial Swap the Company entered a new Swap agreement (“the Swap”) on September 29, 2022 with JPMorgan. The Swap fixes $ 300,000
of the total $ 511,500
existing borrowings of outstanding borrowings under the Revolver at a rate of
3.79 %. As of December 30, 2022, the fair value of the hedge was a liability of $ 220
and is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, the Company amortized $ 339
of the previous unrealized gain, which is included within Other comprehensive loss.
The market risk associated with the Company’s derivative instrument is the result of interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying arrangement. The counterparty to the Swap is JPMorgan. Based on the credit ratings of the Company’s counterparty as of December 30, 2022, nonperformance is not perceived to be a material risk. Furthermore, none of the Company’s derivatives are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on the Company’s credit ratings from any credit rating agency. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of the counterparty to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparty. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant. 22 P. Subsequent Events On January 31, 2023, the Company announced that Michael Ruppert, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, will step down from the Company, effective February 17, 2023. Michelle McCarthy, Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer, will serve as Mercury's interim Chief Financial Officer. On January 31, 2023, the Board of Directors announced the decision to initiate a review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a potential sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be approved or consummated.
Additional details are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on January 31, 2023.

OVERVIEW Mercury Systems, Inc. is a technology company that delivers commercial innovation to rapidly transform the global aerospace and defense industry. Headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, our end-to-end processing platform enables a broad range of aerospace and defense programs, optimized for mission success in some of the most challenging and demanding environments. Our Processing Platform includes signal solutions, display, software applications, networking, storage and secure processing. Our innovative solutions are mission-ready, trusted and secure, software-defined and open and modular to meet our customers’ most-pressing high-tech needs, including those specific to the aerospace and defense community. Customers access our solutions via the Mercury platform, which encompasses the broad scope of our investments in technologies, companies, products, services and the expertise of our people. Ultimately, we connect our customers to what matters most to them. We connect commercial technology to defense, people to data, partners to opportunities and the present to the future. And, at the most human level, we connect what we do to our customers’ missions; supporting the people for whom safety, security and protecting freedom are of paramount importance. As a leading manufacturer of essential components, products, modules and subsystems, we sell to defense prime contractors, the U.S. government and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) commercial aerospace companies. We have built a trusted, contemporary portfolio of proven product solutions purpose-built for aerospace and defense that we believe meets and exceeds the performance needs of our defense and commercial customers. Customers add their own applications and algorithms to our specialized, secure and innovative products and pre-integrated solutions. This allows them to complete their full system by integrating with their platform, the sensor technology and, increasingly, the processing from us. Our products and solutions are deployed in more than 300 programs with over 25 different defense prime contractors and commercial aviation customers. Our transformational business model accelerates the process of making new technology profoundly more accessible to our customers by bridging the gap between commercial technology and aerospace and defense applications. Our long-standing deep relationships with leading high-tech and other commercial companies, coupled with our high level of research and development (“R&D”) investments on a percentage basis and industry-leading trusted and secure design and manufacturing capabilities, are the foundational tenets of this highly successful model. We are leading the development and adaptation of commercial
24 technology for aerospace and defense solutions. From chip-scale to system scale and from data, including radio frequency (“RF”) to digital to decision, we make mission-critical technologies safe, secure, affordable and relevant for our customers.
Our capabilities, technology, people and R&D investment strategy combine to differentiate us in our industry. We maintain our technological edge by investing in critical capabilities and intellectual property (“IP” or “building blocks”) in processing, leveraging open standards and open architectures to adapt quickly those building blocks into solutions for highly data-intensive applications, including emerging needs in areas such as artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our mission critical solutions are deployed by our customers for a variety of applications including command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“C4ISR”), electronic intelligence, mission computing avionics, electro-optical/infrared (“EO/IR”), electronic warfare, weapons and missile defense, hypersonics and radar.
Since we conduct much of our business with our defense customers via commercial items, requests by customers are a primary driver of revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Customers specify delivery date requirements that coincide with their need for our products. Because these customers may use our products in connection with a variety of defense programs or other projects of different sizes and durations, a customer’s orders for one quarter generally do not indicate a trend for future orders by that customer. Additionally, order patterns do not necessarily correlate amongst customers and, therefore, we generally cannot identify sequential quarterly trends. As of December 30, 2022, we had 2,486 employees. We employ hardware and software architects and design engineers, primarily engaged in engineering and research and product development activities to achieve our objectives to fully capitalize upon and maintain our technological leads in the high-performance, real-time sensor processing industry and in mission computing, platform management and other safety-critical applications. Our talent attraction, engagement and retention is critical to execute on our long-term strategy. We invest in our culture and values to drive employee engagement that turns ideas into action, delivering trusted and secure solutions at the speed of innovation. We believe that our success depends on our ability to embrace diversity company-wide and realize the benefits of a diverse workforce that includes a greater variety of solutions to problems, a broader collection of skills and experiences and an array of viewpoints to consider. We are strongly focused on providing an inclusive environment that respects the diversity of the world. We believe that the workforce required to grow our business and deliver creative solutions must be rich in diversity of thought, experience and culture. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives focus on building and maintaining the talent that will create cohesive and collaborative teams that drive innovation. We believe that these values will help our employees realize their full potentials at work to provide Innovation That Matters®. Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net loss, diluted net loss per share, adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”), and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter ended December 30, 2022 were $229.6 million, $13.3 million, $(10.9) million, $(0.19), $0.26, and $35.7 million, respectively. Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net loss, diluted net loss per share, adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”), and adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 30, 2022 were $457.2 million, $25.1 million, $(25.3) million, $(0.45), $0.50, and $66.9 million. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: Results of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2022 includes full period results from the acquisitions of Atlanta Micro, Inc (“Atlanta Micro”) and Avalex Technologies, LLC. (“Avalex”). Results of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021 include only results from the acquisition dates for Atlanta Micro and Avalex. Accordingly, the periods presented below are not directly comparable. The second quarter ended December 30, 2022 compared to the second quarter ended December 31, 2021
The following table sets forth, for the second quarter ended indicated, financial data from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss: (In thousands) December 30, 2022 As a % of Total Net Revenue December 31, 2021 As a % of Total Net Revenue Net revenues $ 229,588  100.0  % $ 220,380  100.0  % Cost of revenues 148,628  64.7  133,158  60.4  Gross margin 80,960  35.3  87,222  39.6  Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 45,057  19.6  36,810  16.7  Research and development 26,906  11.7  28,335  12.9  Amortization of intangible assets 13,536  5.9  16,002  7.3  Restructuring and other charges 2,069  1.0  3,802  1.7  Acquisition costs and other related expenses 939  0.4  2,660  1.2  Total operating expenses 88,507  38.6  87,609  39.8  Loss from operations (7,547) (3.3) (387) (0.2) Interest income 220  0.1  5  —  Interest expense (6,590) (2.9) (1,094) (0.5) Other income (expense), net 846  0.4  (1,318) (0.6) Loss before income taxes (13,071) (5.7) (2,794) (1.3) Income tax benefit (2,151) (0.9) (155) (0.1) Net loss $ (10,920) (4.8) % $ (2,639) (1.2) % R EVENUES Total revenues increased $9.2 million, or 4.2%, to $229.6 million during the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, as compared to $220.4 million during the second quarter ended December 31, 2021, including “acquired revenue” which represents net revenue from acquired businesses that have been part of Mercury for completion of four full quarters or less (and excludes any intercompany transactions). After the completion of four full fiscal quarters, acquired businesses will be treated as organic for current and comparable historical periods. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to an additional $7.2 million of acquired revenues from the Atlanta Micro and Avalex businesses and an additional $2.0 million of organic revenues. These increases were driven by modules and sub-assemblies and components product groupings which increased $15.6 million and $13.7 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases to integrated subsystems of $20.1 million. The increase in total revenue was primarily from C4I, other sensor and effector and electronic warfare end applications which increased $12.8 million, $7.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases to radar end applications and other end applications of $7.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily across the airborne and other platforms which grew $9.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease to the naval platform of $3.0 million during the second quarter ended December 30, 2022. The largest program increases were related to the F-35, NDSA Tranche Tracking Layer, F-16, and LTAMDS programs. There were no programs comprising 10% or more of our revenues for the second quarters ended December 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

M ARGIN Gross margin was 35.3% for the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, a decrease of 430 basis points from the 39.6% gross margin realized during the second quarter ended December 31, 2021. The lower gross margin was primarily driven by program mix, incremental depreciation expense. Program mix was heavily impacted by a customer funding delay on a large FMS sale as well as a higher proportion of lower-margin development programs. These programs generally include higher engineering content evidenced by an increase of $1.9 million in Customer Funded Research and Development (“CRAD”) compared to the second quarter ended December 31, 2021. CRAD primarily represents engineering labor associated with long-term contracts for customized development, production and service activities. The nature of these efforts result in lower margin content, but serve as pre-cursors to higher margin production awards. These products are predominantly grouped within integrated subsystems and to a lesser extent modules and sub-assemblies. Incremental depreciation expense of $2.5 million was recorded in the second quarter ended December 30, 2022. In connection with our 1MPACT facility optimization efforts, we are exiting certain facilities prior to contractual lease terms and consolidating operations across other existing sites. As part of our assessment of future benefits of certain long-lived assets, we identified an immaterial correction of an error in the useful lives assigned to certain leasehold improvements resulting in a cumulative adjustment to depreciation expense.

The increase was primarily related to increased stock compensation expense of $3.0 million related to share-based matching contributions as well as changes to our performance factors associated with performance-based restricted stock awards. The increase was also driven by additional compensation costs and depreciation expense of $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

During the second quarter ended December 30, 2022, we recognized a tax benefit of $2.3 million related to a release of income tax reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The effective tax rate for the second quarters ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development credits, non-deductible compensation, stock compensation shortfalls and state taxes. The effective tax rate for the second quarter ended December 30, 2022 also differed from the federal statutory rate due to the release for previously unrecognized income tax benefits.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law which contained provisions that include a 15% corporate minimum tax effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks after December 31, 2022. We expect the impact of this legislation to be immaterial.
Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires companies to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditures over five years for tax purposes, and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years for tax purposes.

The increase in total revenue was primarily due to an additional $19.0 million of acquired revenues, partially offset by $7.3 million less organic revenues. The increase was driven by higher demand for modules and sub-assemblies and components which increased $36.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively, and were partially offset by decreases in integrated subsystems of $35.3 million during the six months ended December 30, 2022. The increase in total revenue was primarily from the C4I and electronic warfare end applications which increased $24.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, and were partially offset by decreases of $13.0 million and $3.1 million from radar and other sensor and effector end applications, respectively. The increase was primarily across the other and airborne platforms which grew $11.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease to the naval and land platforms which decreased $9.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the six months ended December 30, 2022.

R ESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity come from existing cash and cash generated from operations, our Revolver, our ability to raise capital under our universal shelf registration statement and our ability to factor our receivables. Our near-term fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. We plan to continue to invest in improvements to our facilities, continuous evaluation of potential acquisition opportunities and internal R&D to promote future growth, including new opportunities in avionics mission computers, secure processing, radar modernization and trusted custom microelectronics. We also expect to incur costs related to the Board of Directors' review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, our available Revolver, cash generated from operations and our financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Shelf Registration Statement On September 14, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC. The shelf registration statement, which was effective upon filing with the SEC, registered each of the following securities: debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants and units. We intend to use the proceeds from financings using the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, which may include the following: • the acquisition of other companies or businesses; • the repayment and refinancing of debt; • capital expenditures; • working capital; and • other purposes as described in the prospectus supplement. We have an unlimited amount available under the shelf registration statement.
Revolving Credit Facilities On February 28, 2022, we amended the Revolver to increase and extend the borrowing capacity to a $1.1 billion, 5-year revolving credit line, with the maturity extended to February 28, 2027. As of December 30, 2022, we had $511.5 million of outstanding borrowings on the Revolver. See Note I in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Revolver. Receivables Purchase Agreement On September 27, 2022, we entered into an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement (“RPA”) with Bank of the West, as purchaser, pursuant to which we may offer to sell certain customer receivables, subject to the terms and conditions of the RPA. The RPA is an uncommitted arrangement such that we are not obligated to sell any receivables and Bank of the West has no obligation to purchase any receivables from us. Pursuant to the RPA, Bank of the West may purchase certain of our customer receivables at a discounted rate, subject to a limit that as of any date, the total amount of purchased receivables held by Bank of the West, less the amount of all collections received on such receivables, may not exceed $20.0 million. The RPA has an indefinite term and the agreement remains in effect until it is terminated by either party. We factored accounts receivable and incurred factoring fees of approximately $20.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for the six months ended December 30, 2022.

These increases were partially offset by $30.6 million used in operating activities and $20.5 million invested in purchases of property and equipment. Operating Activities During the six months ended December 30, 2022, we had an outflow of $30.6 million in cash from operating activities and we generated $4.8 million in cash from operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to higher outflows for inventory as we continue to accelerate raw material purchases to support customer delivery schedules and mitigate supply chain risk in future quarters, particularly in light of the long lead times for semiconductors. The decrease was also driven by net changes in benefit for deferred income taxes, prepaid income taxes and income taxes payable, as well as increases in accounts receivables, including unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings, driven by contracting as well as supplier delays which impacted the timing of billing events and cash conversion. Higher outflows of accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by additional deferred revenues and customer advances as well as cash paid for income taxes. Investing Activities During the six months ended December 30, 2022, we invested $20.4 million, a decrease of $239.5 million, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the acquisitions of Avalex and Atlanta Micro. The decrease was also driven by $3.3 million less other investing activities partially offset by $7.1 million higher purchases of property and equipment as compared to the second quarter ended December 31, 2021. Financing Activities During the six months ended December 30, 2022, we had $60.0 million of net borrowings on our Revolver as compared to $251.5 million of net borrowings during the six months ended December 31, 2021. We also had $0.1 million of cash payments related to the purchase and retirement of common stock used to settle individual employees’ tax liabilities associated with the annual vesting of restricted stock awards, as compared to $7.5 million in the second quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the payments related to the purchase and retirement of common stock used to settle individual employees’ tax liabilities associated with vesting of restricted stock awards is due to a change in our incentive stock plan tax withholding methods.

Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the above table.
32 Our standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which we indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third-party with respect to our products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited. As part of our strategy for growth, we continue to explore acquisitions or strategic alliances. The associated acquisition costs incurred in the form of professional fees and services may be material to the future periods in which they occur, regardless of whether the acquisition is ultimately completed.

M EASURES In our periodic communications, we discuss certain important measures that are not calculated according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, organic revenue and acquired revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before other non-operating adjustments, interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third-party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, COVID related expenses, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. We use adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining the portion of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 33 The following table reconciles our net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to our adjusted EBITDA:   Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended (In thousands) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net loss $ (10,920) $ (2,639) $ (25,255) $ (9,779) Other non-operating adjustments, net (1,463) 226  334  643  Interest expense, net 6,370  1,089  10,888  1,675  Income tax benefit (2,151) (155) (3,173) (596) Depreciation 13,697  8,064  22,824  15,820  Amortization of intangible assets 13,536  16,002  28,110  29,736  Restructuring and other charges 2,069  3,802  3,577  16,076  Impairment of long-lived assets —  —  —  —  Acquisition, financing and other third-party costs 1,309  3,115  4,173  5,748  Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 177  (70) 1  (1,731) Litigation and settlement expense, net 70  506  1,375  882  COVID related expenses —  274  61  457  Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 13,003  7,892  23,943  17,465  Adjusted EBITDA $ 35,697  $ 38,106  $ 66,858  $ 76,396  Adjusted income and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We use these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define adjusted income as net income before other non-operating adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third-party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, COVID related expenses, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Adjusted income and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 34 The following tables reconcile net loss and diluted loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, to adjusted income and adjusted EPS:
Second Quarters Ended (In thousands, except per share data) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net loss and loss per share $ (10,920) $ (0.19) $ (2,639) $ (0.05) Other non-operating adjustments, net (1,463) 226  Amortization of intangible assets 13,536  16,002  Restructuring and other charges 2,069  3,802  Impairment of long-lived assets —  —  Acquisition, financing and other third-party costs 1,309  3,115  Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 177  (70) Litigation and settlement expense, net 70  506  COVID related expenses —  274  Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 13,003  7,892  Impact to income taxes (1) (3,039) (7,144) Adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share (2) $ 14,742  $ 0.26  $ 21,964  $ 0.39  Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 56,477  55,693  (1) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the items involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision.
(2) Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using diluted shares whereas Net loss is calculated using basic shares. There was no impact to the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as a result of this for the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Six Months Ended (In thousands, except per share data) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net loss and loss per share $ (25,255) $ (0.45) $ (9,779) $ (0.18) Other non-operating adjustments, net 334  643  Amortization of intangible assets 28,110  29,736  Restructuring and other charges 3,577  16,076  Impairment of long-lived assets —  —  Acquisition and financing costs 4,173  5,748  Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 1  (1,731) Litigation and settlement expense, net 1,375  882  COVID related expenses 61  457  Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 23,943  17,465  Impact to income taxes (1) (8,230) (14,973) Adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share (2) $ 28,089  $ 0.50  $ 44,524  $ 0.80  Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 56,445  55,653  (1) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the items involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes. The recalculation also adjusts for any discrete tax expense or benefit related to the items. (2) Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using diluted shares whereas Net loss is calculated using basic shares. There was no impact to the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as a result of this for the six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 35 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow adjustment described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of our obligations which require cash. The following table reconciles cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow:   Second Quarters Ended Six Months Ended (In thousands) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 35,392  $ 6,824  $ (30,647) $ 4,818  Purchase of property and equipment (13,176) (8,027) (20,504) (13,404) Free cash flow $ 22,216  $ (1,203) $ (51,151) $ (8,586) Organic revenue and acquired revenue are non-GAAP measures for reporting the financial performance of our business. We believe this information provides investors with insight as to our ongoing business performance. Organic revenue represents total company revenue excluding net revenue from acquired companies for the first four full quarters since the entities’ acquisition date (which excludes intercompany transactions). Acquired revenue represents revenue from acquired companies for the first four full quarters since the entities' acquisition date (which excludes intercompany transactions). After the completion of four full fiscal quarters, acquired revenue is treated as organic for current and comparable historical periods. The following tables reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure for the second quarters and six months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively: (In thousands) December 30, 2022 As a % of Total Net Revenue December 31, 2021 As a % of Total Net Revenue $ Change % Change Organic revenue $ 216,318  94  % $ 214,336  97  % $ 1,982  1  % Acquired revenue 13,270  6  % 6,044  3  % 7,226  100  % Total revenues $ 229,588  100  % $ 220,380  100  % $ 9,208  4  % (In thousands) December 30, 2022 As a % of Total Net Revenue December 31, 2021 As a % of Total Net Revenue $ Change % Change Organic revenue $ 432,099  95  % $ 439,349  99  % $ (7,250) (2) % Acquired revenue 25,068  5  % 6,044  1  % 19,024  100  % Total revenues $ 457,167  100  % $ 445,393  100  % $ 11,774  3  % R ECENTLY

ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2022. We continue to review our disclosure controls and procedures and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our Company’s business. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
37 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to those matters currently pending against us and intend to defend ourself vigorously. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial position. In June 2021, Embedded Reps of America, LLC (“ERA”), a former sales representative, and James Mazzola, a principal of ERA, filed for binding arbitration related to the termination of ERA’s sales representative agreement raising multiple claims that aggregate to approximately $9 million in direct damages, with treble damages requested on a number of those claims. ERA was a sales representative of Themis when Themis was acquired by Mercury. The sales representative agreement provided for termination by either party upon 30 days written notice with ERA entitled to commissions for orders obtained by ERA with product shipment occurring prior to termination. We responded to the complaint in July 2021. An arbitration proceeding was held during September 2022, with final motions in October 2022 and oral arguments in November 2022. The arbitrator issued its final ruling in January 2023, awarding ERA less than $0.1 million in damages and fees.
In December 2021, counsel for National Technical Systems, Inc. (“NTS”) sent us an environmental demand letter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A, and CERCLA 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, related to a site that NTS formerly owned at 533 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts. NTS received a Notice of Responsibility from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”) alleging trichloroethene, freon and 1,4-dioxane contamination in the groundwater emanating from NTS’s former site. NTS alleges in its demand letter that the operations of a predecessor company to Mercury that was acquired in our acquisition of the Microsemi carve-out business that once owned and operated a facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts contributed to the groundwater contamination. NTS is seeking payment from us of NTS’s costs for any required environmental remediation. In April 2022, we engaged in a meet and confer session with NTS pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A to discuss the status of the environmental review performed by NTS and its licensed site professional. In addition, in November 2021, we responded to a request for information from MassDEP regarding the detection of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroakyl substances) in the Acton, Massachusetts Water District’s Conant public water supply wells near the former facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts at a level above the standard that MassDEP published for PFAS in October 2020. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, we may have for these matters. ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2022. There have been no changes from the factors disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 16, 2022, although we may disclose changes to such factors from time to time in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 38 ITEM 6.     EXHIBITS The following Exhibits are filed or furnished, as applicable, herewith: 31.1    Certification of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 31.2    Certification of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 32.1+    Certification of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 101.INS eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) Instance Document - the instance document does not appear in the Interactive Data File because its XBRL tags are embedded within the Inline XBRL document 101.SCH XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Document 101.CAL XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase Document 101.DEF XBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase Document 101.LAB XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Document 101.PRE XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase Document 104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as inline XBRL and contained in Exhibit 101)  +    Furnished herewith.
