1.   Description of the Business ​ Stride, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Stride” or the “Company”) is an education services company providing virtual and blended learning. The brand reflects the Company’s continued growth into lifelong learning, regardless of a student’s age or location. The Company’s technology-based products and services enable its clients to attract, enroll, educate, track progress, and support students. These products and services, spanning curriculum, systems, instruction, and support services are designed to help learners of all ages reach their full potential through inspired teaching and personalized learning. The Company’s clients are primarily public and private schools, school districts, and charter boards. Additionally, it offers solutions to employers, government agencies and consumers. These products and services are provided through
two
lines of revenue: ​ ● Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge.  These programs provide an alternative to traditional school options and address a range of student needs including, safety concerns, increased academic support, scheduling flexibility, physical/health restrictions or advanced learning. Products and services are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. ​ ● Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, in-demand industries—including information technology, health care and general business.  The Company pr ovides middle and high school students with Career Learning programs that complement their core general education coursework in math, English, science and history. Stride offers multiple career pathways supported by a diverse catalog of Career Learning courses. The middle school program exposes students to a variety of career options and introduces career skill development. In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students also have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work-based learning experiences that facilitate success in today’s digital, tech-enabled economy.  A student enrolled in a school that offers Stride’s General Education program may elect to take Career Learning courses, but that student and the associated revenue is reported as a General Education enrollment and General Education revenue. A student and the associated revenue is counted as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue only if the student is enrolled in a Career Learning program or school . Like General Education products and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte.  The Company also offers focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, through Galvanize, Inc. (“Galvanize”), Tech Elevator, Inc. (“Tech Elevator”), and MedCerts, LLC (“MedCerts”). These include skills training in the
software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers . These programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies. ​ 2.   Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited.

The results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023, for any other interim period or for any other future fiscal year.

In the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present a fair statement of the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s latest annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 10, 2022, which contains the Company’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. ​ The Company operates in
one
operating and
reportable
business segment as a technology-based education company providing proprietary and third party curriculum, software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning for students and adults. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates profitability based on consolidated results. ​ 3.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ​ Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform
(Topic 848)
(“ASU 2020-04”) which provides relief to companies that will be impacted by the cessation of reference rate reform, e.g. LIBOR, that was tentatively planned for the end of fiscal year 2023. The ASU permitted an entity to consider contract modifications due to reference rate reform to be an event that did not require contract remeasurement. This ASU was applicable from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and adoption was permitted at any time during the period on a prospective basis. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the provisions of Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. The Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility includes the use of alternate rates when LIBOR is not available. The Company does not expect the change from LIBOR to an alternate rate will have a material impact to its condensed consolidated financial statements and, to the extent it enters into modifications of agreements that are impacted by the LIBOR phase-out, the Company will apply such guidance to those contract modifications. ​ Revenue Recognition ​ Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services using the following steps: ​ ● identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; ● identify the performance obligations in the contract; ● determine the transaction price; ● allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and ● recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. ​ Revenues related to the products and services that the Company provides to students in kindergarten through twelfth grade or adult learners are considered to be General Education or Career Learning based on the school or adult program in which the student is enrolled. General Education products and services are focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high- 10
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued growth, in-demand industries—including information technology, business, and health services, for students in middle school through high school and adult learners. ​ The majority of the Company’s contracts are with the following types of customers: ​ ● a virtual or blended school whereby the amount of revenue is primarily determined by funding the school receives; ● a school or individual who licenses certain curriculum on a subscription or course-by-course basis; or ● an enterprise who contracts with the Company to provide job training. ​ Funding-based Contracts ​ The Company provides an integrated package of systems, services, products, and professional expertise that is administered together to support a virtual or blended public school. Contractual agreements generally span multiple years with performance obligations being isolated to annual periods which generally coincide with the Company’s fiscal year. Customers of these programs can obtain administrative support, information technology, academic support services, online curriculum, learning systems platforms and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service agreement. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the state in which the public school or school district is located. Shipments of materials for schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter and for the upcoming school year are recorded in deferred revenue. ​ The Company generates revenues under contracts with virtual and blended public schools and include the following components, where required: ​ ● providing each of a school’s students with access to the Company’s online school and lessons; ● offline learning kits, which include books and materials to supplement the online lessons;
● the use of a personal computer and associated reclamation services; ● internet access and technology support services;
● instruction by a state-certified teacher; and ● management and technology services necessary to support a virtual or blended school. In certain contracts, revenues are determined directly by per enrollment funding. ​ To determine the pro rata amount of revenue to recognize in a fiscal quarter, the Company estimates the total expected funds each school will receive in a particular school year. Total funds for a school are primarily a function of the number of students enrolled in the school and established per enrollment funding levels, which are generally published on an annual basis by the state or school district. The Company reviews its estimates of funding periodically, and updates as necessary, by adjusting its year-to-date earned revenues to be proportional to the total expected revenues to be earned during the fiscal year. Actual school funding may vary from these estimates and the impact of these differences could impact the Company’s results of operations. Since the end of the school year coincides with the end of the Company’s fiscal year, annual revenues are generally based on actual school funding and actual costs incurred (including costs for the Company’s services to the schools plus other costs the schools may incur). The Company’s schools’ reported results are subject to annual school district financial audits, which incorporate enrollment counts, funding and other routine financial audit considerations. The results of these audits are incorporated into the Company’s monthly funding estimates for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Historically, aggregate funding estimates differed from actual reimbursements by less than
2 % of annual revenue, which may vary from quarter to quarter. ​ Each state and/or school district has variations in the school funding formulas and methodologies that it uses to estimate funding for revenue recognition at its respective schools. As the Company estimates funding for each school, it takes into account the state definition for count dates on which reported enrollment numbers will be used for per pupil funding. The parameters the Company considers in estimating funding for revenue recognition purposes include school district count definitions, withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, academic progress, historical completion, student location, funding caps and other state specified categorical program funding. ​ 11
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued Under the contracts where the Company provides products and services to schools, the Company is responsible for substantially all of the expenses incurred by the school and has generally agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools in a given school year. These school operating losses represent the excess of costs incurred over revenues earned by the virtual or blended public school (the school’s expected funding), as reflected in its respective financial statements, including Company charges to the schools. To the extent a school does not receive sufficient funding for each student enrolled in the school, the school would still incur costs associated with serving the unfunded enrollment. If losses due to unfunded enrollments result in a net operating loss for the year that loss is reflected as a reduction in the revenues and net receivables that the Company collects from the school. A school net operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean the Company anticipates losing money on the entire contract with the school. However, a school’s net operating loss may reduce the Company’s ability to collect its management fees in full and recognized revenues are constrained to reflect the expected cash collections from such schools. The Company records the school’s estimated net operating loss against revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year. Actual school net operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions, and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on results of operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s revenues included a reduction for net school operating losses at the schools of $ 6.4
million and $ 12.3
million, respectively, and $ 16.6
million and $ 25.2
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because the Company has agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools, the Company records the expenses incurred by the school as both revenue and expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amounts recorded as revenues and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 123.0
million and $ 117.7
million, respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 248.3
million and
231.6
million, respectively. ​ Subscription-based Contracts ​ The Company provides certain online curriculum and services to schools and school districts under subscription agreements. Revenues from the licensing of curriculum under subscription arrangements are recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Revenues from professional consulting, training and support services are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period. ​ In addition, the Company contracts with individual customers who have access for
one
to
two years
to company-provided online curriculum and generally prepay for services to be received. Adult learners enroll in courses that provide specialized training in a specific industry. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues pro rata over the maximum term of the customer contract based on the defined contract price. ​ Enterprise Contracts ​ The Company provides job training over a specified contract period to enterprises. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues based on the number of students trained during the term of the contract based on the defined contract price. ​ Disaggregated Revenues ​ The revenue recognition related to the types of contracts discussed above can span both of the Company’s lines of revenue as shown below. For example, a funding-based contract may include both General Education and Career Learning students. In total, there is one performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the Company’s fiscal year. The revenue is then disaggregated between General Education and Career Learning based on the Company’s estimated full-year enrollment totals of each category. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately
90 % and
88 %, respectively, of the Company’s General Education revenues, and
100 % and
99 %, respectively, of the Company’s Middle – High School Career Learning revenues, were from funding-based contracts. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately
90 % and
89 %, respectively, of the Company’s General Education revenues,

​ Contract Balances ​ The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing, and cash collection results in accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (a contract asset) and deferred revenue (a contract liability) in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable are recorded when there is an executed customer contract and the customer is billed. An allowance is recorded to reflect expected losses at the time the receivable is recorded. The collectability of outstanding receivables is evaluated regularly by the Company to determine if additional allowances are needed. Unbilled receivables are created when revenue is earned prior to the customer being billed. Deferred revenue is recorded when customers are billed or cash is collected in advance of services being provided.
​ The opening and closing balance of the Company’s accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue are as follows:
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ December 31,  ​ June 30, ​ ​ 2022      2022 ​ ​ ​ (In thousands) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accounts receivable ​ $

83,799 ​ ​
53,630 ​ Deferred revenue, long-term (included in other long-term liabilities) ​ ​
2,565 ​ ​
3,099 ​ ​ The difference between the opening and closing balance of the accounts receivable and unbilled receivables relates to the timing of the Company’s billing in relation to month end and contractual agreements. The difference between the opening and closing balance of the deferred revenue relates to the timing difference between billings to customers and the service periods under the contract. Typically, each of these balances are at their highest during the first quarter of the fiscal year and lowest at the end of the fiscal year. The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the previous October 1 st
deferred revenue balance was $ 42.8
million and $ 34.7
million, respectively. The amount of revenue recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the previous July 1 st
deferred revenue balance was $ 40.6
million and $ 33.0
million, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded revenues of $ 24.5
million and $ 4.6
million, respectively, and $ 24.0
million and $ 6.9
million, respectively, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. 13
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued ​ Performance Obligations ​ A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For the majority of its contracts, the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time, as the Company delivers, and the customer receives the services, over the service period of the contract. The Company’s payment terms are generally net
30
or net
45 , but can vary depending on the customer or when the school receives its funding from the state. ​ The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, not to report the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers that have an expected duration of one year or less. The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers which extend beyond
one
year as of December 31, 2022 was $ 2.6
million. ​ Significant Judgments ​ The Company determined that the majority of its contracts with customers contain one performance obligation. The Company markets the products and services as an integrated package building off its curriculum offerings. It does not market distinct products or services to be sold independently from the curriculum offering. The Company provides the significant service of integrating the goods and services into the operation of the school and education of its students, for which the customer has contracted. ​ The Company has determined that the time elapsed method is the most appropriate measure of progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Generally, the Company delivers the integrated products and services package over the course of the Company’s fiscal year. This package includes enrollment, marketing, teacher training, etc. in addition to the core curriculum and instruction. All of these activities are necessary and contribute to the overall education of its students, which occurs evenly throughout the year. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis. ​ The Company determined that the expected value method is the most appropriate method to account for variable consideration and the Company’s forecasting method is an estimation process that uses probability to determine expected funding. On a monthly basis, the Company estimates the total funds each school will receive in a particular school year and the amount of full-year school revenues and operating expenses to determine the amount of revenue the Company will recognize. Enrollment and state funding rates are key inputs to this estimate. The estimates are adjusted monthly, and a cumulative catch-up adjustment is recorded to revenue as necessary to reflect the total revenues earned to date to be proportional to the total revenues to be earned in the fiscal year. The Company builds in known constraints (i.e. enrollment, funding, net operating losses, etc.) into the estimate of the variable consideration to record the most probable amount. ​ Sales Taxes Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenues. Collected but unremitted sales tax is included as part of accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revenues do not include sales tax as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. ​ Consolidation ​ The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the wholly-owned and affiliated companies that the Company owns, directly or indirectly, and all controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. ​ Investments in Marketable Securities The Company’s marketable securities generally consist of bonds and other securities which are classified as held-to-maturity. The securities with maturities between three months and one year are classified as short-term and are included
14
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued in other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term and are included in deposits and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost. Interest income and dividends are recorded within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company reviews the held-to-maturity debt securities for declines in fair value below the amortized cost basis under the credit loss model of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(“ASC 326”). Any decline in fair value related to a credit loss is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, with the amount of the loss limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity debt securities was
zero . As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s marketable securities consisted of investments in corporate bonds, U.S. treasury notes and commercial paper. The short-term and long-term portions were $ 82.9
million and $ 21.0
million, respectively. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities range from
one
to
two
years.

The Company maintains an allowance under ASC 326 based on historical losses, changes in payment history, customer-specific information, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The allowance under ASC 326 is updated as additional losses are incurred or information becomes available related to the customer or economic conditions.
​
The Company writes-off accounts receivable based on the age of the receivable and the facts and circumstances surrounding the customer and reasons for non-payment. Actual write-offs might differ from the recorded allowance. ​ Inventories ​ Inventories consist primarily of textbooks and curriculum materials, a majority of which are supplied to virtual and blended public schools, and utilized directly by students. Inventories represent items that are purchased and held for sale and are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company classifies its inventory
15
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued as current or long-term based on the holding period. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $ 10.8
million and $ 11.2
million, respectively, of inventory, net of reserves, was deemed long-term and included in deposits and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory is established based upon the evaluation of the quantity on hand relative to demand. The excess and obsolete inventory reserve was $ 7.5
million and $ 6.5
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. ​ Other Current Assets ​ Other current assets consist primarily of textbooks, curriculum materials and other supplies which are expected to be returned upon the completion of the school year. Materials not returned are expensed as part of instructional costs and services. Additionally, other current assets include short-term marketable securities. ​ Property and Equipment ​ Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset (or the lesser of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the asset under the finance lease). Amortization of assets capitalized under finance lease arrangements is included in depreciation expense. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. The determination of the lease term is discussed below under “Leases.” ​ Property and equipment are depreciated over the following useful lives: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Useful Life Student and state testing computers and printers ​ 3

Leasehold improvements ​ Shorter of useful life or term of the lease ​ The Company makes an estimate of unreturned student computers and printers based on an analysis of recent trends of returns.  The Company recorded accelerated depreciation of $ 1.4
million and $ 1.3
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 3.1
million and $ 1.9
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to unreturned student computers and printers.
​ Depreciation expense, including accelerated depreciation, related to computers and printers provided to students reflected in instructional costs and services for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 10.3  million and $ 9.8
million, respectively, and $ 20.6
million and $ 17.9
million, respectively, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.0
million and $ 1.2
million, respectively and $ 2.6
million and $ 2.3
million, respectively, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
​ The Company fully expenses computer peripheral equipment (e.g., keyboards, mouses) upon purchase as recovery has been determined to be uneconomical. These expenses totaled $ 0.6
million and $ 2.5
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.8
million and $ 7.3
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are recorded as instructional costs and services. ​ Capitalized Software Costs ​ The Company develops software for internal use. Software development costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. The Company amortizes these costs over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally
three years . Capitalized software development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. 16
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued ​ Capitalized software additions totaled $ 21.4
million and $ 19.3
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded amortization expense related to capitalized software of $ 7.4  million and $ 5.9  million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 13.1
million and $ 12.1
million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, within instructional costs and services. Amortization expense related to capitalized software reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.3
million and $ 1.3
million, respectively and $ 2.7
million and $ 2.6
million, respectively, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ Capitalized Curriculum Development Costs ​ The Company internally develops curriculum, which is primarily provided as online content and accessed via the Internet. The Company also creates textbooks and other materials that are complementary to online content. ​ The Company capitalizes curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage, as well as the design and deployment phases of the project. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of its development efforts on the content of the courseware. Capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to its customers, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. The period of time over which these development costs are amortized is generally
five years . ​ Total capitalized curriculum development additions were $ 9.5
million and $ 7.5
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of amortization charges. Amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 4.1
million and $ 3.8
million, respectively, and $ 8.2
million and $ 8.0
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in instructional costs and services. ​ Leases ​ The Company’s principal leasing activities include student computers and peripherals, classified as finance leases, and facilities, classified as operating leases.
​ Leases are classified as operating leases unless they meet any of the criteria below to be classified as a finance lease: ​ ● the lease transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease; ● the lease grants an option to purchase the asset which the lessee is expected to exercise; ● the lease term reflects a major part of the asset’s economic life; ● the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds the fair value of the asset; or ● the asset is specialized with no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the term. ​ Finance Leases ​ The Company enters into agreements to finance the purchase of student computers and peripherals provided to students of its schools. Individual leases typically include
3-year
payment terms, at varying rates. The Company pledges the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases.
​ Operating Leases
​ The Company enters into agreements for facilities that serve as offices for its headquarters and school operations. Lease terms vary between
1
and
11 years . Certain leases include renewal options, usually based upon current market rates,
17
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued as well as termination rights. The Company performs an evaluation of each lease to determine if the lease payments included in the renewal option should be included in the initial measurement of the lease liability. ​ Discount Rate ​ The present value of the lease payments is calculated using either the rate implicit in the lease, or the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, over the lease term. For the Company’s finance leases, the stated rate is defined within the lease terms; while for the Company’s operating leases, the rate is not implicit. For operating leases, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate; determined as the Company’s borrowing rate on a collateralized basis for a similar term and amount to the term and amount of the lease. The Company’s current incremental borrowing rate of
4.42 % is based upon its agreements used for its finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is subsequently reassessed upon modification of its leasing arrangements or with the execution of a new lease agreement. ​ Policy Elections ​ Short-term Leases ​ The Company has elected as an on-going accounting policy election not to record a right-of-use asset or lease liability on its short-term facility leases of 12 months or less, and will expense its lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The accounting policy election is made by class of underlying asset to which the right of use relates. The Company has elected to apply the accounting policy election only to operating leases. ​ Income Taxes ​ Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. The net deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. ​ Goodwill and Intangible Assets ​ The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations subject to amortization are recorded at their fair value. Finite-lived intangible assets include trade names, acquired customers and distributors, developed technology and non-compete agreements. Such intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3.3
million and $ 3.2
million, respectively, and $ 6.6
million and $ 6.4
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Future amortization of intangible assets is expected to be $ 6.5
million, $ 12.1
million, $ 10.9
million, $ 9.7
million, and $ 8.1
million in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2023 through June 30, 2027, respectively, and $ 35.9
million thereafter. ​ The Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset.
​ The Company has
one
reporting unit. The process for testing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment is performed annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred. Companies are also allowed to qualitatively assess goodwill impairment through a screening process which would permit companies to forgo the quantitative impairment test as part of their annual goodwill impairment process. The Company performs its annual assessment on May 31 st
which is then updated for any changes in condition as of June 30 th . ​ During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill was impaired. 18

88.7 ​ Impairment of Long-Lived Assets ​ Long-lived assets include property, equipment, right-of-use assets, capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use. Management reviews the Company’s recorded long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company determines the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon its expectation of the asset’s future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
​ Fair Value Measurements ​ Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Measurements are described in a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ​ The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are: ​ Level 1:   Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. ​ Level 2:   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. ​ Level 3:   Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation. ​ The carrying values reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and short-term debt approximate their fair values, as they are largely short-term in nature. The Tallo, Inc. convertible note is discussed in more detail in Note 11, “Acquisitions and Investments.” As of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the long-term debt was $ 377.2
million. The Company estimated the fair value based on the quoted market prices in an inactive market on the last day of the reporting period (Level 2). The long-term debt, comprised of the Company’s convertible senior notes due 2027, is recorded at face value less the unamortized debt issuance costs on its condensed consolidated balance sheet, and is discussed in more detail in Note 6, “Debt.” As of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company’s marketable securities was $ 103.0
million. The Company estimated the fair value based on the

100 % of MedCerts in exchange for $ 70.0
million and estimated contingent consideration of $ 10.8
million. During fiscal year 2021 and 2022, the Company recorded an aggregate expense of $ 0.5
million to adjust its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration to $ 11.3
million. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company paid $ 7.0
million to settle the contingent consideration and recorded a gain of $ 4.3
million. The gain is recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. ​ There were

Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share ​ Basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes vested restricted stock awards. Diluted net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming conversion or exercise of all dilutive unexercised stock options and vesting of all dilutive unvested restricted stock awards. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock awards was determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock awards, the amount of compensation cost for future service not yet recognized by the Company and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded as income tax expense when the stock options become deductible for income tax purposes are all assumed to be used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Stock options and restricted stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share when they are antidilutive. Common stock outstanding reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets includes restricted stock awards outstanding. The dilutive effect of the Company’s convertible debt is determined using the if-converted method when the Company’s stock is trading above the conversion price. However, based on the structure of the instrument and how it is settled upon conversion, it would produce a similar result as the previously applied treasury stock method. ​ The following schedule presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to the expected reversal of the cumulative temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is measured by the change in the deferred income tax asset or liability during the period. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s effective income tax rate was
27.1 % and
27.5 %, respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the rate was
28.8 % and
26.5 %, respectively. ​ 21

​ Before June 1, 2027, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. After June 1, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until
two days
prior to the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying cash up to the outstanding principal amount, and at the Company’s election, will settle the conversion spread by paying or delivering cash or shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is
18.9109
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $ 52.88
per share of common stock (lower strike price). The Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option at any time after September 6, 2024 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain stock price hurdles as discussed in the Indenture. ​ In connection with the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The upper strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $ 86.174
per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was $ 60.4
million and was recorded within additional paid-in capital. ​ ​ 7.   Credit Facility ​ On January 27, 2020, the Company entered into a $ 100.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) to be used for general corporate operating purposes with PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Credit Facility has a
five-year
term and incorporates customary financial and other covenants, including but not limited to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The majority of the Company’s borrowings under the Credit Facility were at LIBOR plus an additional rate ranging from
0.875 % -
1.50 % based on the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facility is secured by the Company’s assets. The Credit Facility agreement allows for an amendment to establish a new benchmark interest rate when LIBOR is discontinued during the
five-year
term. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. As part of the proceeds received from the Notes, the Company repaid its $ 100.0
million outstanding balance and as of December 31, 2022, the Company had
no
amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also includes a $ 200.0
million accordion feature. ​ 8.   Equity Incentive Plan ​ On December 9, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2016 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “2016 Plan”). The amended and restated 2016 Plan reflects an increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by
1,045,000
shares, the removal of certain provisions that were otherwise required for awards to qualify as performance-based compensation under an exception to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue

Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued Code of 1986, as amended, prior to its repeal, an extension of the term of the amended and restated 2016 Plan to October 7, 2032, an increase to the limit on the number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options, and a prohibition on the payment of dividends and dividend equivalents on unvested awards.
​ The amended and restated 2016 Plan is designed to attract, retain and motivate employees who make important contributions to the Company by providing such individuals with equity ownership opportunities. Awards granted under the Plan may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards. Under the amended and restated 2016 Plan, unissued shares related to forfeited or cancelled awards granted under the amended and restated 2016 Plan or awards granted under the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “Prior Plan”) (to the extent such awards granted under the Prior Plan were outstanding as of December 15, 2016 and were forfeited or cancelled prior to September 19, 2022), will again be available for issuance under the amended and restated 2016 Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares tendered to pay the exercise price or tax withholding with respect to a stock option, or shares that are not issued in connection with the settlement of a stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, or shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options will not again be available for issuance under the amended and restated 2016 Plan. ​ As of December 31, 2022, the remaining aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for future issuance under the amended and restated 2016 Plan was
2,457,533 . As of December 31, 2022, there were
1,666,099
shares of the Company’s common stock that remain outstanding or nonvested under the amended and restated 2016 Plan and Prior Plan. ​ Compensation expense for all equity-based compensation awards is based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. The vesting of performance-based awards is contingent on the achievement of certain performance metrics. Compensation expense is recognized retroactively, through a cumulative catch-up adjustment, when the performance conditions are satisfied or when the Company determines that it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. The amount of compensation expense recognized for a performance-based award is affected by the level of achievement attained. Management has established three levels of attainment: threshold, target, and outperform. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. ​ Stock Options ​ Each stock option is exercisable pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth in the stock option agreement granting such stock option, generally over
four years .
No
stock option shall be exercisable after the expiration of its option term. The Company has granted stock options under the Prior Plan and the Company has also granted stock options to executive officers under stand-alone agreements outside the Prior Plan. ​ Stock option activity including stand-alone agreements during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​      ​ ​      Weighted      ​ ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ Average ​ ​ ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Remaining ​ Aggregate   ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercise ​ Contractual ​ Intrinsic   ​ ​ Shares ​ Price ​ Life (Years) ​ Value   Outstanding, June 30, 2022 ​

Under the Plan and Prior Plan, employees, outside directors and independent contractors are able to participate in the Company’s future performance through the awards of restricted stock. Each RSA vests pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth in the restricted stock agreement granting such RSAs, generally over
three years . Under the Plan and Prior Plan, there have been

performance-based restricted stock awards vested. Vesting of the performance-based restricted stock awards is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance goals and service vesting conditions. During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted
358,294
performance-based restricted stock awards to the Company’s then CEO with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $ 27.91
per share. These awards were granted pursuant to the Plan and are subject to the achievement of target free cash flow metrics in each of the fiscal years 2020 through 2022. The metrics are measured at the end of each fiscal year; however if either of the first two tranches are not achieved, the awards may still vest if the free cash flow metric in aggregate is met over the
three-year
life of the award. In August 2021, the second tranche was achieved at above target resulting in the vesting of
119,431
shares. In August 2022, the first and third tranches were achieved at target resulting in the vesting of
238,863
shares. Service-Based Restricted Stock Awards (included above) ​ During the six months ended December 31, 2022,

​ Performance Share Units (“PSU”) ​ The Company has approved grants of performance share units (“PSU”) pursuant to the Plan. Each PSU is earned through the achievement of a performance-based metric, combined with the continuation of employee service over a defined period. The level of performance determines the number of PSUs earned, and is generally measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels of the award. Each PSU represents the right to receive
one
share of the Company’s common stock, or at the option of the Company, an equivalent amount of cash, and is classified as an equity or liability award. When the grant is a fixed monetary amount, and the number of shares is not determined until achievement and the value of the Company’s stock on that day, the PSU is a liability-classified award. Each PSU vests pursuant to the vesting schedule found in the respective PSU agreement. ​ In addition to the performance conditions of the PSUs, there is a service vesting condition which is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company, unless the grantee is eligible for earlier vesting upon a change in control and qualifying termination, as defined by the PSU agreement. PSUs are generally subject to graduated vesting schedules and stock-based compensation expense is computed by tranche and recognized on a straight-line basis over the tranches’ applicable vesting period based on the expected achievement level. ​ Performance share unit activity (excluding liability-classified awards) during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ ​ ​ ​ Grant-Date ​      Shares      Fair Value Nonvested, June 30, 2022 ​

289,640
PSUs at target under a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which are tied to operating income targets and stock price performance. These PSUs had a grant date fair value of $ 10.0
million, or a weighted average grant-date fair value of $ 34.41
per share.
Fifty
percent of the earned award is based on operating income performance (“Tranche #1) and
fifty
percent is based on the performance of the Company’s stock price (“Tranche #2), both of which will vest after achievement is certified during the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The grant date fair value of Tranche #1 was remeasured in October 2022 as a result of a modification of the terms of the award. Originally, performance was tied to gross margin. The metric was changed to operating income to better align with shareholder feedback and technology industry and peer group common practice. The modification of the performance criteria from gross margin to operating income resulted in a new fair market value as of the modification date of $ 4.8
million, a decrease of $ 0.8
million. For Tranche #1, the level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. For Tranche #2, the number of PSUs will be earned based on the Company’s compounded annual stock price growth over a completed
three-year
performance period. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The fair value of Tranche #2 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Tranche #2 is a market-based award, and therefore is not subject to any probability assessment by the Company. The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance condition for Tranche #1 is not

percent is based on the performance of the Company’s stock price (“Tranche #2), both of which will vest after achievement is certified during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. For Tranche #1, the level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. For Tranche #2, the number of PSUs will be earned based on the Company’s compounded annual stock price growth over a completed
three-year
performance period. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The fair value of Tranche #2 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance condition for Tranche #1 is not able to be determined at this time. ​ Fiscal Year 2021 Tech Elevator MIP ​ During fiscal year 2021, the Company granted to the executive team of Tech Elevator a time-based award with a value of $ 4.0
million and a performance-based award with a target value of $ 4.0
million under a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”). The time-based award vests equally over
three years
on the anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition of Tech Elevator which was November 30, 2020. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022,
one -third vested and was settled with the issuance of
38,575
PSUs. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, an additional one-third vested and was settled with the issuance of
37,886
PSUs. The performance-based award is tied to the achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets of Tech Elevator.
Seventy
percent of the award is based on Tech Elevator’s revenues for the calendar year 2023 (“Tranche #1”) and
thirty
percent of the earned award is based on Tech Elevator’s EBITDA for the calendar year 2023 (“Tranche #2”), both of which are expected to vest after achievement is certified in January 2024. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold and target achievement levels. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The MIP is a liability-classified award. The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance conditions is not able to be determined at this time. ​ Fiscal Year 2021 LTIP ​ During fiscal year 2021, the Company granted

The fiscal year 2021 LTIP is an equity-classified award. ​ Fiscal Year 2020 Galvanize TRIP ​ During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted to the executive team of Galvanize a target level of $ 12.3
million under a Transaction Related Incentive Plan (“TRIP”) which is tied to the achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets of Galvanize.
Seventy
percent of the earned award is based on the performance of Galvanize for the calendar year 2021 (“Tranche #1”) and
thirty
percent of the earned award is based on the performance of Galvanize for the calendar year 2022 (“Tranche #2”), both of which are expected to vest after achievement is certified in January following each of the calendar year ends. The revenue and EBITDA targets are split
sixty
percent and
forty
percent, respectively, for both tranches. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. In January 2022, the Company determined that the metrics for calendar year 2021 were not met and Tranche #1

shares. ​ Summary of All Performance Share Units ​ As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 7.7
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested PSUs that are expected to vest based on the Company’s probability assumptions discussed above. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

Securities Litigation On November 19 and December 11, 2020, respectively,
two
putative securities class action lawsuits captioned Yun Chau Lee v. K12 Inc., et al, Case No. 1:20-cv-01419 (the “Lee Case”), and Jennifer Baig v. K12 Inc., et al, Case No. 1:20-cv-01528 (the “Baig Case”) were filed against the Company and two of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, purportedly on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s common stock between April 27, 2020 and September 18, 2020. On February 17, 2021, the District Court consolidated the Lee Case and the Baig Case under the caption In re K12 Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. 1:20-cv-01419 (the “Consolidated Securities Class Action”), and appointed a lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on April 5, 2021, alleging violations by the Company and the individual defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and violations by the individual defendants of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the Company and the individual defendants made false or misleading statements and/or omitted to disclose material facts concerning the Company’s technological capabilities and expertise to support increased demand for virtual and blended education related to the global emergence of COVID-19, its cybersecurity protocols and protections, and its administrative support and training to teachers, students, and parents. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on May 20, 2021, which the District Court granted, without prejudice, on September 16, 2021. The plaintiffs did not file a second amended complaint, but appealed the District Court’s dismissal decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on December 1, 2021. On November 22, 2022, the Fourth Circuit issued a published opinion affirming the District Court’s decision and upholding the dismissal of the case.

three
of the Company’s shareholders in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs purported to assert claims on the Company’s behalf against certain of its officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and for violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based on substantially the same facts alleged in the Consolidated Securities Class Action. By stipulation of the parties on May 14, 2021, the Court consolidated the Shemen Case and the Ahmed Case under the caption In re Stride Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No. 20-01731 (the “Consolidated Derivative Action”), designated as operative the complaint filed in the Ahmed Case, and stayed all proceedings pending final resolution of the Consolidated Securities Class Action. On December 29, 2022, upon stipulation of the parties, the Court approved the voluntary dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims, without prejudice, in light of the dismissal of the Consolidated Securities Class Action. 31

​ In addition, the Company contractually guarantees that certain schools under the Company’s management will not have annual operating deficits and the Company’s management fees from these schools may be reduced accordingly to cover any school operating deficits. ​ Other than these lease and operating deficit guarantees, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ​ Risks and Uncertainties ​ Impacts of COVID-19 on Stride’s Business ​ While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, in late fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2022, we experienced an increase in demand for our products and services. The effects of the pandemic or the ending of the pandemic on our business, are not estimable. ​ The Company continues to conduct business as usual with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain events. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that it determines is in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on the Company’s business, including the effects on its customers and prospects, or on its long-term financial results. 11.   Acquisitions and Investments   Investments in Limited Partnerships ​ The Company invested in
three
early stage funds focused on career education with a total commitment of $ 15.0
million. The Company invested in Rethink Education III, LP (“Rethink”) and New Markets Education Partners II, L.P. and New Markets Education Partners III, L.P. (collectively, “New Markets”) to support the development of new technologies that will advance online learning, to find early opportunities to adopt those new technologies at Stride, and to simultaneously achieve a reasonable return on investment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has contributed an aggregate $ 10.4
million to these funds: $ 3.2
million is an investment in New Markets and is recorded at cost and will be adjusted, as necessary, for impairment; and $ 7.2
million is an investment in Rethink and is recorded under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s investments in these funds are included in deposits and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. ​ 32
Table of Contents   STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued Investment in Tallo, Inc. and Acquisition of Assets ​ In August 2018, the Company made an initial investment of $ 6.7
million for a
39.5 % minority interest in Tallo, Inc. (“Tallo”). In August 2020, the Company invested an additional $ 2.3
million which increased its minority interest to
46.1 %. These investments in preferred stock, which contain additional rights over common stock and have no readily determinable fair value, were recorded at cost and will be adjusted, as necessary, for impairment.  In the event Tallo issues equity at a materially different price than what the Company paid, the Company would also assess changing the carrying value.  In conjunction with the Company’s initial investment in August 2018, Tallo also issued a convertible note to the Company for $ 5.0
million that is being accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security and adjusted to fair value quarterly. The note bears interest at the mid-term Applicable Federal Rate plus
25
bps per annum with a maturity of
48 months . The note is convertible at the Company’s option into
3.67
million Series D Preferred Shares that, combined with the shares resulting from the conversion of the accrued interest, would give the Company an effective ownership of
55 % if exercised. In October 2021, the Company agreed to loan Tallo up to $ 3.0
million. This promissory note bears interest at
5 % and has a maturity date of
five years . The promissory note does not contain any means of conversion into additional ownership by the Company. During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2022, the Company funded $ 3.0
million under the promissory note.
​ During fiscal year 2022, the Company adjusted its investment in Tallo preferred stock to fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $ 4.5
million to other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Also, during fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded a credit loss expense of $ 4.1
million to reduce the carrying amount of the convertible note and $ 3.0
million to reduce the carrying amount of the promissory note. The credit loss expenses were recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company reversed an aggregate $ 0.4
million of accrued interest on both instruments and made an accounting policy election to record this within interest income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s investment in Tallo, the convertible note, and promissory note were included in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. ​ On July 8, 2022, the Company purchased the assets of Tallo in exchange for $ 1.0
million, plus $ 0.4
million in working capital.  As part of the closing of the transaction, the promissory note was cancelled and the convertible note was converted into additional equity. That additional equity and previously held equity interests were cancelled, and combined with the cash, resulted in a purchase price of $ 7.3
million. The acquisition of Tallo further expands the Company’s ability to match students to internships, jobs, and scholarships with colleges and companies looking for talent. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which results in acquired assets and assumed liabilities being measured at their fair values as of July 8, 2022, the acquisition date. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in goodwill of $ 5.7
million and intangible assets of $ 1.3
million, both of which are deductible for income tax purposes. The recognized goodwill is primarily associated with future customer relationships and an acquired assembled work force. The intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships which will be amortized over
10 years . During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company made an adjustment to the allocation of the purchase price resulting in an increase of goodwill from $ 5.2
million to $ 5.7
million. ​ ​ 33

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report, as well as the consolidated financial statements and MD&A of our Annual Report. The following overview provides a summary of the sections included in our MD&A: ​ ● Executive Summary —

Our technology-based products and services enable our clients to attract, enroll, educate, track progress, and support students. These products and services, spanning curriculum, systems, instruction, and support services are designed to help learners of all ages reach their full potential through inspired teaching and personalized learning.   ​ Our clients are primarily public and private schools, school districts, and charter boards. Additionally, we offer solutions to employers, government agencies and consumers.   ​ We offer a wide range of individual products and services, as well as customized solutions, such as our most comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which supports our clients in operating full-time virtual or blended schools.  More than three million students have attended schools powered by Stride curriculum and services since our inception. In our most recent academic year ended June 30, 2022, we graduated 11,775 high school students. ​ Our solutions address two growing markets: General Education and Career Learning.   ​ 35

​ ●     Adult Learning ​ ​ ​ Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. These programs provide an alternative to traditional school options and address a range of student needs including safety concerns, increased academic support, scheduling flexibility, physical/health restrictions or advanced learning. Products and services are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. ​ Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, in-demand industries—including information technology, health care and general business. We
provide
middle and high school students with Career Learning programs that complement their core general education coursework in math, English, science and history. Stride offers multiple career pathways supported by a diverse catalog of Career Learning courses. The middle school program exposes students to a variety of career options and introduces career skill development. In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students also have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work - based learning experiences that facilitate success in today’s digital, tech-enabled economy. A student enrolled in a school that offers
Stride’s
General Education program may elect to take Career Learning courses ,
but that student and
the
associated revenue is reported as
a
General Education enrollment
and General Education
revenue. A student and the associated revenue is counted as
a
Career Learning
enrollment or Career Learning revenue only
if
the student is
enrolled in a Career Learning program or school .
Like General Education products and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte.  We also offer focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, through Galvanize, Inc. (“Galvanize”), Tech Elevator, Inc. (“Tech Elevator”), and MedCerts, LLC (“MedCerts”). These include skills training in the
software engineering, healthcare ,
and medical fields,
as well as providing
staffing and talent development
services to employers . These programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies. ​ For both the General Education and Career Learning markets, the majority of revenue is derived from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which includes an integrated package of curriculum, technology systems, instruction, and support services that we administer on behalf of our customers. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification of non-renewal. During any fiscal year, we may enter into new agreements, receive non-automatic renewal notices, negotiate replacement agreements, terminate such agreements or receive notices of termination, or customers may transition a school to a different offering. For the 2022-2023 school year, we provide our school-as-a-service offering for 85 schools in 31 states and the District of Columbia in the General Education market, and 52 schools or programs in 27 states and the District of Columbia in the Career Learning market. ​ We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum, administration support and technology services to virtual and blended public schools. The amount of revenue generated from these contracts is impacted largely by the number of enrollments, the mix of enrollments across grades and states, state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirement, among other items. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a
36
Table of Contents   negotiated time frame. ​ The two key financial metrics that we use to assess financial performance are revenues and operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, revenues increased to $883.6 million from $809.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 9.1%. Over the same period, operating income decreased to $39.4 million from $49.9 million in the prior year, a decrease of 21.0%. The decrease in operating income was driven by increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses; partially offset by increases in revenue. Additionally, we use the non-financial metric of total enrollments to assess performance, as enrollment is a key driver of our revenues. Total enrollments for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were 176.6 thousand, a decrease of 11.4 thousand, or 6.1%, over the prior year. Our revenues are subject to annual school district financial audits, which incorporate enrollment counts, funding and other routine financial audit considerations. The results from these audits and other routine changes in funding estimates are incorporated into the Company’s monthly funding estimates for the current and prior periods. Historically, aggregate funding estimates differed from actual reimbursements by less than 2% of annual revenue, which may vary from quarter to quarter. ​ While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, in late fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2022, we experienced an increase in demand for our products and services. The effects of the pandemic or the ending of the pandemic on our business, are not estimable. ​ Environmental, Social and Governance ​ As overseers of risk and stewards of long-term enterprise value, Stride’s Board of Directors plays a vital role in assessing our organization’s environmental and social impacts.  They are also responsible for understanding the potential impact and related risks of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues on the organization’s operating model. Our Board and management are committed to identifying those ESG issues most likely to impact business operations and growth. We craft policies that are appropriate for our industry and that are of concern to our employees, investors, customers and other key stakeholders. Our Board ensures that the Company’s leaders have ample opportunity to leverage ESG for the long-term good of the organization, its stakeholders, and society. Each Committee of the Board monitors ESG efforts in their respective areas, with the Nominating and Governance Committee coordinating across all Committees. ​ Since our inception twenty years ago, we have removed barriers that impact academic equity. We provide high-quality education for anyone—particularly those in underserved communities—as a means to foster economic empowerment and address societal inequities from kindergarten all the way through college and career readiness. We reinforced our commitment in this area by launching several initiatives including initially offering scholarships to advance education and career opportunities for students in underserved communities, expanding career pathways in socially responsible law enforcement and increasing employment of teachers in underserved communities at Stride-powered schools.  We developed interactive, modular courses focused on racial equity and social justice that are being made available for free to every public school. ​ Among the many ESG issues we support within the Company, we endeavor to promote diversity and inclusion across every aspect of the organization. We sponsor employee resource groups to provide support for female, minority, differently abled, LGBTQ+, and veteran employees and support employee volunteer efforts.  Our commitment is evident in the make-up of our leadership team.  We have more minorities in executive management and more women in executive management than the representative population. Importantly, our Board of Directors is also diverse with female, Hispanic, and black or African American members. ​ Our commitment to ESG initiatives is an endeavor both the Board and management undertake for the general betterment of those both inside and outside of our Company. ​ The nature of our business supports environmental sustainability.  Most of our employees work from home and most students at Stride-powered schools attend virtual classes, even prior to the COVID-19 crisis, reducing the carbon output from commuting in cars or buses. Our online curriculum reduces the need for paper.  Our meetings are most often held virtually using digital first presentations rather than paper. ​ Critical Accounting Estimates ​ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our
37
Table of Contents   condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in our Annual Report. There have been no significant updates to our critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report. ​ Results of Operations Impacts of COVID-19 on Stride’s Business ​ While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, in late fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2022, we experienced an increase in demand for our products and services. The effects of the pandemic or the ending of the pandemic on our business, are not estimable. ​ We continue to conduct business as usual with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain events. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects, or on our long-term financial results. ​ Lines of Revenue ​ We operate in one operating and reportable business segment as a technology-based education company providing proprietary and third-party curriculum, software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates profitability based on consolidated results. We have two lines of revenue: (i) General Education and (ii) Career Learning.
Enrollment Data ​ The following table sets forth total enrollment data for students in our General Education and Career Learning lines of revenue.  Enrollments for General Education and Career Learning only include those students in full service public or private programs where Stride provides a combination of curriculum, technology, instructional and support services inclusive of administrative support. No enrollments are included in Career Learning for Galvanize, Tech Elevator or MedCerts. This data includes enrollments for which Stride receives no public funding or revenue. If the mix of enrollments changes, our revenues will be impacted to the extent the average revenue per enrollment is significantly different. We do not award or permit incentive compensation to be paid to our public school program enrollment staff or contractors based on the number of students enrolled.

​ Revenues.   Our revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $458.4 million, representing an increase of $48.9 million, or 11.9%, from $409.5 million for the same period in the prior year. General Education revenues decreased $38.5 million, or 12.3%, year over year. The decrease in General Education revenues was primarily due to the 23.6% decrease in enrollments, school mix (distribution of enrollments by school), and other factors. Career Learning revenues increased $87.4 million, or 90.8%, primarily due to a 58.2% increase in enrollments and school mix. ​ Instructional costs and services expenses.   Instructional costs and services expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $288.3 million, representing an increase of $26.3 million, or 10.0%, from $262.0 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase in expense was due to the timing of hiring of personnel and salary increases. Instructional costs and services expenses were 62.9% of revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease from 64.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. ​ Selling, general, and administrative expenses.   Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $102.0 million, representing an increase of $11.4 million, or 12.6% from $90.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million in personnel and related benefit costs, including stock-based compensation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 22.3% of revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase from 22.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. ​ Income tax expense.   Income tax expense was $18.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, or 27.1% of income before income taxes, as compared to an expense of $15.9 million, or 27.5% of income before income taxes for
40
Table of Contents   the same period in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible compensation.   ​ Comparison of the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 ​ Revenues.   Our revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $883.6 million, representing an increase of $73.9 million, or 9.1%, from $809.7 million for the same period in the prior year. General Education revenues decreased $73.2 million, or 11.8%, year over year. The decrease in General Education revenues was primarily due to the 23.7% decrease in enrollments, school mix (distribution of enrollments by school), and other factors. Career Learning revenues increased $147.0 million, or 77.3%, primarily due to a 55.4% increase in enrollments and school mix. ​ Instructional costs and services expenses.   Instructional costs and services expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $583.8 million, representing an increase of $48.0 million, or 9.0%, from $535.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase in expense was due to the timing of hiring of personnel and salary increases. Instructional costs and services expenses were 66.1% of revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease from 66.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. ​ Selling, general, and administrative expenses.   Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $260.4 million, representing an increase of $36.4 million, or 16.3% from $224.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $24.6 million in professional services and marketing expenses and $14.4 million increase in personnel and related benefit costs, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in operating lease expense.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 29.5% of revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase from 27.7% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. ​ Income tax expense.   Income tax expense was $11.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, or 28.8% of income before income taxes, as compared to an expense of $13.0 million, or 26.5% of income before income taxes for the same period in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the reserve related to the capital losses that resulted from the Tallo transaction.   ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources ​ As of December 31, 2022, we had net working capital, or current assets minus current liabilities, of $679.6 million. Our working capital includes cash and cash equivalents of $318.3 million and accounts receivable of $442.2 million. Our working capital provides a significant source of liquidity for our normal operating needs. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the fiscal year based on the timing of customer billings and collections and tends to be highest in our first fiscal quarter as we begin billing for students. In addition, our cash and accounts receivable were significantly in excess of our accounts payable and short-term accrued liabilities at December 31, 2022. ​ During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued $420.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (“Notes”). The Notes are governed by an indenture (the “Indenture”) between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $408.6 million after deducting the underwriting fees and other expenses paid by the Company. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 st
and September 1 st
of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on September 1, 2027. In connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The upper strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $86.174 per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was $60.4 million and was recorded within additional paid-in capital. Before June 1, 2027, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. After June 1, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until two days prior to the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying cash up to the outstanding principal amount, and at our election, will settle the conversion spread by paying or delivering cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The initial conversion rate is 18.9109 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which
41
Table of Contents   represents an initial conversion price of approximately $52.88 per share of common stock. The Notes will be redeemable at our option at any time after September 6, 2024 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain stock price hurdles as discussed in the Indenture. ​ On January 27, 2020, we entered into a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) to be used for general corporate operating purposes with PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Credit Facility has a five-year term and incorporates customary financial and other covenants, including but not limited to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The majority of our borrowings under the Credit Facility were at LIBOR plus an additional rate ranging from 0.875% - 1.50% based on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facility is secured by our assets. The Credit Facility agreement allows for an amendment to establish a new benchmark interest rate when LIBOR is discontinued during the five-year term. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. As part of the proceeds received from the Notes, we repaid our $100.0 million outstanding balance and as of December 31, 2022, we had no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also includes a $200.0 million accordion feature. ​ We are a lessee under finance leases for student computers and peripherals under agreements with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC (“BALC”) and CSI Leasing, Inc. (“CSI Leasing”). As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the finance lease liability was $73.3 million and $66.3 million, respectively, with lease interest rates ranging from 1.52% to 5.83%. ​ We entered into an agreement with BALC in April 2020 for $25.0 million (increased to $41.0 million in July 2020) to provide financing for our leases through March 2021 at varying rates. We entered into additional agreements during fiscal year 2021 to provide financing of $54.0 million for our student computers and peripherals leases through October 2022 at varying rates. Individual leases with BALC include 36 month payment terms, fixed rates ranging from 1.52% to 5.83%, and a $1 purchase option at the end of each lease term. We pledged the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases. ​ We entered into an agreement with CSI Leasing in August 2022 to provide financing for our leases. Individual leases under the agreement with CSI Leasing include 36-month payments terms, at varying rates. We did not enter into any individual leases under the agreement through December 31, 2022. ​ Our cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses, capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to interest on our Notes, office facility leases, capital equipment leases and other operating leases. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We believe that the combination of funds to be generated from operations, borrowing on our Credit Facility and net working capital on hand will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, we continue to explore acquisitions, strategic investments and joint ventures related to our business that we may acquire using cash, stock, debt, contribution of assets or a combination thereof. ​ Operating Activities ​ Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $21.2 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $11.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $32.9 million was primarily due to improved collections of accounts receivable during the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year. ​ Investing Activities ​ Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $55.0 million compared to $59.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $4.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable securities of $12.3 million, partially offset by $5.2 million in proceeds related to the sale of a minority investment during the six months ended December 31, 2021 and an increase in capital expenditures year over year of $4.2 million. ​ 42
Table of Contents   Financing Activities ​ Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $37.3 million compared to $57.8 million during the six months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the repurchase of restricted stock for income tax withholding of $25.1 million and a $7.9 million payment of deferred purchase consideration in fiscal year 2022, partially offset by a payment of contingent consideration of $7.0 million and an increase in the repayment of finance lease obligations incurred for the acquisition of student computers of $5.2 million. ​ Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. ​ Inflation Risk
​ Current inflation has resulted in higher personnel costs, marketing expenses and supply chain expenses. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse or material impact on our operating results and financial condition. ​ Interest Rate Risk ​ As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $318.3 million and $389.4 million, respectively. Our excess cash has been invested in money market funds, government securities, corporate debt securities and similar investments. At December 31, 2022, a 1% gross increase in interest rates for our variable-interest instruments would result in a $3.2 million annualized increase in interest income. Additionally, the fair value of our investment portfolio is subject to changes in market interest rates. ​ Our short-term debt obligations under our Credit Facility are subject to interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance on our Credit Facility. ​ Foreign Currency Exchange Risk ​ We currently operate in several foreign countries, but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency. If we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operations in a foreign currency, we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and/or currency translation risk. Exchange rates between U.S. dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations. ​ Item 4.         Controls and Procedures. ​ Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures ​ We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. ​ We carried out an evaluation, required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this review, our
