HOME FEDERAL BANCORP, INC.
OF LOUISIANA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
1.   Summary of Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the “Company”) and its subsidiary, Home Federal Bank (“Home
Federal Bank” or the “Bank”). These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”). The FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in these
footnotes are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification” or the “ASC”).
In accordance with the subsequent events topic of the ASC, the Company evaluates
events and transactions that occur after the statement of financial condition date for potential recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The effect of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed
at the statement of financial condition date are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2022.  In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluated the events and transactions that occurred
through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.
Use of Estimates
In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for
loan losses.
Nature of Operations
Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana, a Louisiana corporation, is the fully public stock holding company for Home Federal Bank
located in Shreveport, Louisiana.  The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings and loan association and is subject to federal regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The
Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Services are provided to the Bank’s customers by
nine
full-service banking offices and home office, located in Caddo, Bossier and Webster Parishes, Louisiana. The area served by the Bank is primarily the Shreveport-Bossier City-Minden
combined statistical area; however, loan and deposit customers are found dispersed in a wider geographical area covering much of northwest Louisiana. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had
one
wholly-owned subsidiary, Metro Financial Services, Inc., which previously engaged in the sale of annuity contracts and does not currently engage in a meaningful amount of business.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, balances due from banks, and federal funds sold, all of which mature within ninety days.

Securities are
being accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 320’s,
Investments,
which requires the classification of securities into one of three categories: Trading, Available-for-Sale, or
Held-to-Maturity.  Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates this classification periodically.
Investments in non-marketable equity securities and debt securities, in which the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of the related premiums and accretion of discounts, using the interest method. Investments in debt
securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and marketable equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities.
Securities that are acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling in the
near term are classified as trading securities. Investments in securities not classified as trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Trading account and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings, while net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive loss.
The Company held
no
trading securities as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the term of the securities.   Securities
are periodically reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment. For debt securities, management considers whether the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference
defined as the credit loss), the magnitude and duration of the decline, the reasons underlying the decline and the Company’s intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the
security before its anticipated recovery in market value, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, if the Company does not intend to sell the security, and
it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss. Any remaining difference between fair value and
amortized cost (the difference defined as the non-credit portion) is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within noninterest
income in the consolidated statements of income.
The Bank has invested in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, and other
similar correspondent banks, which is reflected at cost in these
consolidated
financial statements. As a member of the FHLB System,
the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in an amount determined by the FHLB. The FHLB stock is redeemable at par value at the discretion of the FHLB.
Loans Held-for-Sale
Loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income.
Loans
Loans receivable are stated as unpaid principal balances less allowances for loan
losses and unamortized deferred loan fees. Net nonrefundable fees (loan origination fees, commitment fees, discount points) and costs associated with lending activities are being deferred and subsequently amortized into income as an adjustment of
yield on the related interest earning assets using the interest method. Interest income on contractual loans receivable is recognized on the accrual method. Unearned discount on property improvement and automobile loans is deferred and amortized
on the interest method over the life of the loan.

Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is established as
losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed.
Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and
is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value
of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. A loan is considered
impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is
impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the present value of future cash flows or fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the Bank will
recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings. A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial
difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions granted under a TDR typically involve a temporary or permanent reduction in payments or interest rate or an extension of a loan’s stated
maturity date at less than a current market rate of interest. Loans identified as TDRs are designated as impaired.
An allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans
classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received.
When, in management’s judgment, the borrower’s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status.
It should be understood that estimates of future loan losses involve an exercise of judgment.  While it is possible that in particular periods the Company may
sustain losses which are substantial relative to the allowance for loan losses, it is the judgment of management that the allowance for loan losses reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition is adequate to
absorb known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio both probable and reasonable to estimate. All loans greater than 90 days past due are generally placed on nonaccrual status.
Off-Balance Sheet Credit Related Financial Instruments
In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into commitments to
extend credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
Foreclosed Assets
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held-for-sale and are transferred to other real estate owned at the lower of cost or current fair
value minus estimated costs to sell as of the date of foreclosure.  Cost is defined as the lower of the fair value of the property or the recorded investment in the loan.  Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by
management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Premises and Equipment
Land is carried at cost.  Buildings and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings and Improvements

-

Bank-Owned Life Insurance
The Bank has purchased life insurance contracts on the lives of certain key
employees. The Bank is the beneficiary of these policies. These contracts are reported at their cash surrender value and changes in the cash surrender value are included in non-interest income.
Income Taxes
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary file a consolidated Federal income tax
return on a fiscal year basis. Each entity pays its pro-rata share of income taxes in accordance with a written tax-sharing agreement.
The Company accounts for income taxes on the asset and liability method.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces
deferred tax assets to the expected amount most likely to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income and recoverable taxes paid in prior years.  Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Current taxes are measured by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income to determine the amount of
taxes receivable or payable.
The Company follows the provisions of the
Income
Taxes
Topic of the FASB ASC 740.  ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides
guidance on various related matters such as derecognition, interest, penalties, and disclosures required.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
While the Company is exempt from Louisiana income tax, it is subject to the
Louisiana Ad Valorem Tax, commonly referred to as the Louisiana Shares Tax, which is based on stockholders’ equity and net income.
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share were $ 1.10
and $ 1.05 , respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $ 0.79
and $ 0.73 , respectively, for
the six months ended December 31, 2021.  The Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share were $ 0.57
and $ 0.55 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $ 0.36
and $ 0.34 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Stock-Based Compensation
GAAP requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options and recognition and retention share awards, to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of income based on their fair values.  The amount of compensation is measured at the fair value of the options or recognition and
retention share awards when granted, and this cost is expensed over the required service period, which is normally the vesting period of the options or recognition and retention awards.
Reclassification
Certain financial statement balances included in the prior
year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Comprehensive Income
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, are reported
as a separate component of the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial condition along with net income, they are components of comprehensive loss.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments
in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss
estimates.  For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods with those fiscal years.  The extent of the impact upon
adoption is not known and will depend on the characteristics of the Company’s loan portfolio and economic conditions on that date as well as forecasted conditions thereafter.  Utilizing a third party vendor model, a preliminary CECL calculation
was completed with the December 31, 2022 quarter end call report information.  The bank is continuing to evaluate the current model and methodology as well as consideration of any necessary qualitative adjustments.  The Bank will continue to work
with the third-party each quarter to ensure it is conforming with the ASU at adoption date and plans to present to the Board a parallel to the existing incurred loss model with March 31, 2023 call report information.
ASU 2022-02, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (“ASU 2022-02”) eliminates the guidance on troubled debt restructurings and requires entities to
evaluate all loan modifications to determine if they result in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. ASU 2022-02 also requires that entities disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for loans and leases. ASU
2022-02 is effective January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statement disclosures.

The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in
mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were caused by interest rate changes. The contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. Government and Municipal Goverment. Accordingly,
it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company’s investment. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and
because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022.
The Company’s investment in equity securities
consists primarily of FHLB stock and shares of First National Bankers Bankshares, Inc. (“FNBB”). Management monitors its investment portfolio to determine whether any investment securities which have unrealized losses should be considered
other than temporarily impaired.
At December 31, 2022, securities with a carrying
value of $ 500 ,000 were pledged to secure public deposits and securities and mortgage loans with a carrying value of $ 182.5
million were pledged to secure FHLB advances.

Credit Quality Indicators
The Company segregates loans into risk categories based on the pertinent information about the
ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes loans
individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. Once a loan has been classified as substandard or identified as special mention, management will conduct a quarterly review to evaluate the level of deterioration, improvement,
and impairment, if any, as well as assign the appropriate risk category. The delinquent loan report is monitored monthly to determine if any loan needs to be evaluated for classification or impairment.
Loans excluded from the scope of the quarterly review process above are generally identified as
pass credits until: (a) they become past due; (b) management becomes aware of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower; or (c) the customer contacts the Company for a modification.  In these circumstances, the loan is
specifically evaluated for potential classification and the need to allocate reserves or charge-off. All loans greater than 90 days past due are generally placed on nonaccrual status. The Company uses the following definitions for risk
ratings:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
3.            Loans Receivable
(continued)
Credit Quality Indicators (continued)
Pass - Loans classified as pass are well
protected by the current net worth or paying capacity of the obligor or by the fair value, less costs to acquire and sell the underlying collateral in a timely manner.
Pass Watch - Loans are considered
marginal, meaning some weakness has been identified which could cause future impairment of repayment. However, these relationships are currently protected from any apparent loss by collateral.
Special Mention - Loans identified as
special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Bank’s credit position at some
future date.
Substandard - Loans classified as
substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the
debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful
have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable
and improbable.
Loss - This classification includes
those loans which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted.  Even though partial recovery may be possible in the future, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these
basically worthless loans.  Accordingly, these loans are charged-off before period end.

Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when contractually due.  Loans that experience
insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls are generally not classified as impaired.  On a case-by-case basis, management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls, taking into consideration all of the
circumstances related to the loan, including the length of the payment delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.

For purposes of the determination of an allowance for loan losses on these TDRs,
as an identified TDR, the Company considers a loss probable on the loan and, as a result, the loan is reviewed for specific impairment in accordance with the Company’s allowance for loan loss methodology.  If it is determined losses are probable
on such TDRs, either because of delinquency or other credit quality indicator, the Company establishes specific reserves for these loans.  As of December 31, 2022, there were
no
commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing sums to the Company whose terms have been modified in TDRs.
The Company had
no
TDR that has subsequently defaulte d in the last 12 months.
There was

7.   Related Party Transactions
Certain directors and executive officers
were indebted to the Bank in the approximate aggregate amount of $ 4.1
million at December 31, 2022 and $ 4.2
million June 30, 2022.
8.   Fair Value Disclosures
The following disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of ASC 825,
Financial Instruments. Financial instruments are defined as cash and contractual rights and obligations that require settlement, directly or indirectly, in cash. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values have been
estimated using the present value of future cash flows or other valuation techniques. The results of these techniques are highly sensitive to the assumptions used, such as those concerning appropriate discount rates and estimates of future cash
flows, which require considerable judgment. Accordingly, estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current settlement of the underlying financial instruments.
ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments
from its disclosure requirements. These disclosures should not be interpreted as representing an aggregate measure of the underlying value of the Company.
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
fair values of financial instruments:
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
The carrying amount approximates the fair
value of cash and cash equivalents.
Investment Securities
Fair values for investment securities, including
mortgage-backed securities, are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. The carrying values of restricted or
non-marketable equity securities approximate their fair values. The carrying amount of accrued investment income approximates its fair value.
Mortgage Loans
Held-for-Sale
Because these loans are normally disposed of within
ninety days
of origination, their carrying value closely approximates the fair value of such loans.
Loans Receivable
For variable-rate loans that re-price
frequently and with no significant changes in credit risk, fair value approximates the carrying value. Fair values for other loans are estimated using the discounted value of expected future cash flows. Interest rates used are those being
offered currently for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.
Deposit Liabilities
The fair values for demand deposit accounts are, by
definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date, that is, their carrying amounts. Fair values for other deposit accounts are estimated using the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The discount rate is
estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar maturities.
Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates
their fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar borrowing arrangements.
Off-Balance Sheet Credit-Related
Instruments
Fair values for outstanding mortgage loan commitments to
lend are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining term of the agreements, customer credit quality, and changes in lending rates.

The Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”).  ASC 820 affirms a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 was issued to establish a uniform
definition of fair value. The definition of fair value is market-based as opposed to company-specific and includes the following:
•
Defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in either case, through an orderly transaction between market participants at a measurement date and establishes a framework for measuring fair value;
•
Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements
based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date;
•
Nullifies the guidance in EITF 02-3, which required the deferral
of profit at inception of a transaction involving a derivative financial instrument in the absence of observable data supporting the valuation technique;
•
Eliminates large position discounts for financial instruments
quoted in active markets and requires consideration of the company’s creditworthiness when valuing liabilities; and
•
Expands disclosures about instruments that are measured at fair
value.
The standard establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for
disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy favors the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 – Fair value is based upon quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets in which the Company can participate.
27
Index
HOME FEDERAL BANCORP, INC. OF LOUISIANA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
8.            Fair Value Disclosures
(continued)
•
Level 2 –
Fair value is based upon (a) quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not
current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (d)
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
•
Level 3 – Fair value is based upon   inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the Company’s
own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). These inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances,
which include the Company’s own data. The Company’s own data used to develop unobservable inputs are adjusted if information indicates that market participants would use different assumptions.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based
upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not
be indicative of the net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Fair values of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at December
31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows:

9.           Leases
A lease is defined as a contract,
or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On July 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02  “Leases” (Topic 842)  and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 842. For the Company, Topic 842 primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee. Substantially all
of the leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate property for branches with terms extending through 2058. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, and therefore, were previously
not recognized on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition.
With the adoption of Topic 842, operating lease agreements are required to be recognized on the consolidated statements of
financial
condition as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and corresponding lease liabilities. See table;

The calculated amount of the ROU
assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at
the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding
the discount rate, Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a
collateralized basis, over a similar term.

Immediately after closing and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, First National Bank of Benton (“FNBB”), which had been the wholly owned subsidiary of NWB, was merged with and into Home Federal Bank, the Company’s wholly owned
subsidiary, with Home Federal Bank as the surviving institution.
The
Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of NWB for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $ 10.2
million
($ 128.16
per NWB common share). In addition to the merger consideration, the Merger Agreement provided that, prior to consummation of
the merger, NWB would pay a special distribution in cash to its stockholders in an aggregate amount which would reduce the ratio of NWB’s total stockholders’ equity to total consolidated assets to
8.0 %. The amount of the special distribution was approximately $ 9.3
million.

HOME FEDERAL BANCORP, INC. OF LOUISIANA
ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
The Company’s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of Home Federal Bank (the “Bank”), its wholly owned subsidiary. The Bank’s results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest
income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  Results of operations are also affected by provisions for loan
losses and loan sale activities.  Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, and other expenses.  Our results of operations are also significantly
affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies, and actions of regulatory authorities.  Future changes in applicable law, regulations, or government policies may materially
impact our financial condition and results of operations.
The Bank operates from its main office in Shreveport, Louisiana and nine full service branch offices located in Shreveport, Bossier City and Minden, Louisiana.  The Company’s primary market area is the
Shreveport-Bossier City-Minden combined statistical area.
Critical Accounting Policies
Allowance for Loan Losses.   The Company has identified the calculation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy, due to the higher degree of judgment
and complexity than its other significant accounting policies.  Provisions for loan losses are based upon management’s periodic valuation and assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, trends in non-performing loans,
current economic conditions, and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level believed by management to represent all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonably
estimable.  Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
Income Taxes.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method.  Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or
liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws.  The realization of our deferred tax
assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income.  We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors.  We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances, if our
judgments change.
Discussion of Financial Condition Changes from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022
General
At December 31, 2022, the Company reported total assets of $576.5 million, a decrease of $13.9 million, or 2.4%, compared to total assets of $590.5 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in assets was comprised
primarily of decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $43.6 million, or 68.1%, from $64.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $20.4 million at December 31, 2022, loans held-for-sale of $1.7 million, or 43.5%, from $4.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $2.2
million at December 31, 2022, investment securities of $699,000, or 0.6%, from $108.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $107.4 million at December 31, 2022, and premises and equipment of $161,000, or 1.0%, from $16.2 million at June 30, 2022 to $16.1
million at December 31, 2022.   These decreases were partially offset by increases in loans receivable, net of $31.3 million, or 8.1%, from $387.9 million at June 30, 2022 to $419.2 million at December 31, 2022, deferred tax asset of $318,000, or
27.8%, from $1.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $1.5 million at December 31, 2022, real estate owned of $269,000 from none at June 30, 2022 to $269,000 at December 31, 2022, accrued interest receivable of $260,000, or 23.1%, from $1.1 million at June
30, 2022 to $1.4 million at December 31, 2022, other assets  of $59,000, or 4.2%, from $1.4 million at June 30, 2022 to $1.5 million at December 31, 2022, and bank owned life insurance of $52,000, or 0.8%, from $6.6 million at June 30, 2022 to $6.7
million at December 31, 2022.

Discussion of Financial Condition Changes from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022 (continued)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash   and cash equivalents decreased $43.6 million, or 68.1%, from $64.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $20.4 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash and cash
equivalents was primarily due to an increase in commercial loan originations and security purchases.
Loans Receivable, Net
Loans receivable, net, increased by $31.3 million, or 8.1%, to $419.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $387.9 million at June 30, 2022.  The increase in loans receivable, net, was primarily due to increases
in commercial real estate loans of $17.6 million, one-to-four-family residential loans of $13.0 million, equity line-of-credit loans of $2.6 million, commercial non-real estate loans of $2.5 million, multi-family residential loans of $75,000, and
equity and second mortgage loans of $14,000, partially offset by decreases in construction loans of $3.7 million, land loans of $523,000, and consumer loans of $45,000.
Loans Held-for-Sale
Loans held-for-sale decreased $1.7 million, or 43.5%, from $4.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $2.2 million at December 31, 2022.  The decrease in loans held-for-sale resulted primarily from the decrease in the
origination volume during the first six months of fiscal year end 2023.
Investment Securities
Investment securities amounted to $107.4 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $108.0 million at June 30, 2022, a decrease of $699,000, or 0.6%.  The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to
principal repayments on mortgage backed securities of $6.5 million and a $1.1 million increase in market value losses on available-for-sale securities offset by security purchases of $6.9 million.
Premises and Equipment, Net
Premises and equipment, net, decreased $161,000, or 1.0%, to $16.1 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $16.2 million at June 30, 2022.  The decrease in premises and equipment was primarily due to depreciation
expense for the six month period.
Asset Quality
At December 31, 2022, the Company had $2.2 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to $2.2 million on
non-performing assets at June 30, 2022, consisting of six single-family residential loans and two single family residences in other real estate owned at December 31, 2022, compared to six single-family residential loans and one line of credit loan
at June 30, 2022.  At December 31, 2022,  the Company had four single family residential loans and two commercial real estate loans classified as substandard compared to five single family residential loans and two commercial real estate loans
classified as substandard at June 30, 2022.  There were two one-to-four family residential loans moved to real estate owned during the quarter ending December 31, 2022.  There were no loans classified as doubtful at December 31, 2022 or June 30,
2022.
Total Liabilities
Total liabilities decreased $10.3 million, or 1.9%, from $538.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $527.9 million at December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in total deposits of $13.8 million, or 2.6%, to $518.2
million at December 31, 2022 compared to $532.0 million at June 30, 2022, other accrued expenses and liabilities of $505,000, or 19.4%, to $2.1 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $2.6 million at June 30, 2022, advances from borrowers for
taxes and insurance of $176,000, or 49.7%, to $178,000 at December 31, 2022 compared to $354,000 at June 30, 2022, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of $18,000 or 2.2%, to $814,000 at December 31, 2022 compared to $832,000 at June 30,
2022, partially offset by an increase in other borrowings of $4.2 million, or 178.7%, to $6.6 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $2.4 million at June 30, 2022.  The decrease in deposits was primarily due to a $28.7 million, or 21.6%, decrease
in savings deposits from $133.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $104.3 million at December 31, 2022, a $9.7 million, or 6.0%, decrease in non-interest bearing deposits from $161.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $151.5 million at December 31, 2022, a $2.4
million, or 2.5%, decrease in money market deposits from $98.6 million at June 30, 2022 to $96.2 million at December 31, 2022, and a decrease of $2.2 million, or 3.7%,  in NOW accounts from $59.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $56.8 million at
December 31, 2022, partially offset by an increase of $29.2 million, or 36.4%, in certificates of deposit from $80.3 million at June 30, 2022 to $109.5 million at December 31, 2022. The Company had $3.0 million in brokered deposits at December 31,
2022 compared to $6.0 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank was primarily due to principal paydowns on amortizing advances.  The entire balance in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank at December 31,
2022 were short-term due to our only advance with a balloon maturity in January 2023.  We will be paying off this debt with funds from our FHLB demand account.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity decreased $3.7 million, or 7.0%, to $48.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $52.3 million at June 30, 2022. The primary reasons for the changes in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2022 were the repurchase of Company stock
of $6.0 million, a decrease in the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income of $878,000, and dividends paid totaling $781,000, partially offset by net income of $3.4 million, the vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options, and the
release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling $381,000, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of $198,000.
The Company repurchased 291,000 shares of its common stock during the six months ended December 31, 2022 at an average price per share of $19.99. On February 16, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of
Directors approved an eleventh stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 170,000 shares. The eleventh stock repurchase program was completed on August 2, 2022.
Regulatory Capital
The Bank is required to meet minimum capital standards promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  At December 31, 2022, Home Federal Bank’s regulatory capital was well in excess of the
minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 9.99%, 14.08%, 9.99%, and 15.25%,
respectively.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General
The increase in net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year quarter resulted primarily from a $1.1 million, or 27.2%, increase in net interest income,  a decrease of
$128,000, or 3.5%, in non-interest expense, partially offset by a decrease of $497,000, or 48.1%, in non-interest income, a $144,000, or 47.9%, increase in provision for income taxes  and an $89,000, or 145.9%, increase in provision for loan
losses. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to loan growth. The increase in net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from a $2.2 million, or
26.4%, increase in net interest income, a decrease of $200,000, or 30.6%, in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease of $966,000, or 47.1% in non-interest income, an increase of $507,000, or 831.1%, in provision for loan losses,
and an increase of $91,000, or 1.3%, in non-interest expense. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to loan growth.

HOME FEDERAL BANCORP, INC. OF LOUISIANA
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (continued)
Net Interest Income
The increase in net interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a $1.4 million, or 29.9%, increase in total interest income, partially offset by an increase of $263,000, or
52.5%, in total interest expense.  The Company’s average interest rate spread was 3.67% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.99% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.91% for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.15% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in net interest income for the six-month period was primarily due to a $2.4 million, or 25.5%, increase in total interest income, partially offset by a $189,000, or 18.0%, increase in total interest expense. The Company’s average
interest rate spread was 3.70% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.99% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.91% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.15% for the
six months ended December 31, 2021.
Provision for Loans Losses
Based on an analysis of historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by Home Federal Bank, the status of past due principal and interest payments, general economic conditions, particularly as such
conditions relate to our market area, and other factors related to the collectability of Home Federal Bank’s loan portfolio, the provision for loan losses was $150,000 for the three month period ended December 31, 2022 and $568,000 for the  six
month period ended December 31, 2022, compared to $61,000 in provisions made for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $4.8 million, or 1.14% of total loans receivable, at December 31, 2022
compared to $4.2 million, or 1.14% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2021.  At December 31, 2022, Home Federal Bank had $1.9 million in non-performing loans and $269,000 in other real estate owned which totaled $2.2 million in
non-performing assets.
Non-interest Income
The $497,000 decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year quarterly period, was primarily due to a decrease of $568,000 in gain on sale of loans, a $4,000
decrease in other non-interest income, and a $2,000 decrease in income from bank owned life insurance partially offset by an increase of $77,000 in service charges on deposit accounts.
The $966,000 decrease in non-interest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year six-month period was primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 million in gain on sale of loans, a decrease
of $5,000 in other non-interest income, and a $3,000 decrease in income from bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a $145,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts. The decreases in gain on sale of loans for both the quarter and
six-month periods were primarily due to a decrease in refinance activity causing a decrease in mortgage loan originations.  The Company sells most of its long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations primarily in order to manage
interest rate risk.
Non-interest Expense
The $128,000 decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily attributable to decreases of $213,000 in compensation and benefits expense,
$33,000 in audit and examination fees, $31,000 in legal fees, $20,000 in franchise and bank shares expense, $6,000 in loan and collection expense, and $2,000 in advertising expense. The decreases were partially offset by increases of $64,000 in
other non-interest expense, $55,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, $44,000 in data processing expense, and $14,000 in deposit insurance premium expense.
The $91,000 increase in non-interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same six month period in 2021, is primarily attributable to increases of $158,000 in other non-interest
expense, $128,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, $23,000 in deposit insurance premium expense, $16,000 in data processing expense, partially offset by decreases of $141,000 in compensation and benefits expense, $30,000 in audit and examination
fees, $30,000 in franchise and bank shares expense, $26,000 in loan and collection expense, $5,000 in legal fees, and $2,000 in advertising expense.  The Louisiana bank shares tax is assessed on the Bank’s equity and earnings.  For the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized franchise and bank shares tax expense of $122,000 and $241,000, respectively, compared to $142,000 and $271,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2021.

Income Taxes
Income taxes amounted to $444,000 and $453,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.6% and 11.8%. Income taxes amounted to $300,000 and $653,000
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in provision for income taxes was due to an adjustment in taxes related to stock option exercises.
Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned, and Rates Paid.
The following tables show for the periods indicated the
total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Tax-exempt
income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. All average balances are based on monthly balances. Management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (continued)
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Bank maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management.  The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay its borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. The Bank also adjusts
liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.
The Bank’s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales, and earnings
and funds provided from operations.  While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates,
economic conditions, and competition.  The Bank sets the interest rates on its deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits.  In addition, the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets which
provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.  The Bank’s deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $638,000 at December 31, 2022.
A significant portion of the Bank’s liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. The Bank’s primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans
and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts.  If the Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas which provides an additional
source of funds.  At December 31, 2022, the Bank had $814,000 in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas
and had $182.5 million in additional borrowing capacity.
Additionally, at December
31, 2022, the Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed $20.4 million. There were no amounts
purchased under this agreement as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company had available a $10.0 million line of credit agreement at December 31, 2022 with First National Bankers Bank. At December 31, 2022, there was a $6.6 million balance
in the credit line.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank had outstanding loan commitments of $58.4 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of $13.9 million. At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit
scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $77.8 million.   Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no
assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment.    If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, Home Federal Bank intends
to sell its securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 9.99%, 14.08%, 9.99%, and 15.25%,
respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms
of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation.
Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s
performance than does the effect of inflation.

including the effects of the Tax Reform Act; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, the cost of funds, demand for loan products and the demand for financial services, in each case as may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, competition, changes
in the quality or composition of the Company’s loans, investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios; geographic concentration of the Company’s business; fluctuations in real estate values; the adequacy of loan loss reserves; the risk that
goodwill and intangibles recorded in the Company’s financial statements will become impaired; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company’s
