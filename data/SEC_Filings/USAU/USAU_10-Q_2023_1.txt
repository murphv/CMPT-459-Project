FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
Some
information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include comments relating
to (i) the ability of available cash reserves at January 31, 2023 to be sufficient for greater than the next twelve months; and (ii)
royalties to be paid to U.S. Gold Corp. upon future exploration success at the Maggie Creek project.
We
use the words “anticipate,” “continue,” “likely,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,”
“could,” “will,” “project,” “should,” “believe” and variations of such words
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Statements that contain these words discuss our future expectations and
plans, or state other forward-looking information. Although we believe the expectations and assumptions reflected in those forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. Our actual results
could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in,
or incorporate by reference in this report, including:
●
the
timing, duration and overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and exploration activities;
●
deviations
from the projections set forth in the prefeasibility study for the CK Gold Project due to unanticipated variations in grade, unexpected
challenges with potential mining of the deposit, volatility in commodity prices, variations in expected recoveries, increases in
projected operating or capital costs, or delays in our permitting plans;
●
the
strength of the world economies;
●
fluctuations
in interest rates and inflation rates;
●
changes
in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities;
●
the
impact of geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine;
●
our
ability to maintain compliance with the NASDAQ Capital Market’s (the “NASDAQ”) listing standards;
●
volatility
in the market price of our common stock;
●
our
ability to fund our business with our current cash reserves based on our currently planned activities;
●
our
ability to raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to us or at all;
●
our
expected cash needs and the availability and plans with respect to future financing;
●
our
ability to retain key management and mining personnel necessary to successfully operate and grow our business; and
●
the
factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022.
Many
of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect
future events or developments. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us and persons acting on our
behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization
U.S.
Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey
in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed
its name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation.
On
June 13, 2016, Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), a private Nevada corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Gold King Merger Agreement”) with the Company, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Dataram Acquisition Sub,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Acquisition Sub”), and all of the principal shareholders of Gold King. Upon closing of the transactions
contemplated under the Gold King Merger Agreement (the “Gold King Merger”), Gold King merged with and into Acquisition Sub
with Gold King as the surviving corporation and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Gold King Merger was treated as
a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company. The financial statements
are those of Gold King (the accounting acquirer) prior to the merger and include the activity of the Company (the legal acquirer) from
the date of the Gold King Merger. Gold King is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development opportunities
primarily in Nevada and Wyoming. The Company has a wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Gold Acquisition Corporation, formerly Dataram Acquisition
Sub, Inc. (“U.S. Gold Acquisition”), a Nevada corporation which was formed in April 2016.
On
May 23, 2017, the Company closed the Gold King Merger with Gold King. The Gold King Merger constituted a change of control and the majority
of the board of directors changed with the consummation of the Gold King Merger. The Company issued shares of common stock to Gold King
which represented approximately
90 %
of the combined company.
On
September 10, 2019, the Company, 2637262 Ontario Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“NumberCo”),
and all of the shareholders of NumberCo (the “NumberCo Shareholders”), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share
Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue to the NumberCo Shareholders
200,000
shares
of the Company’s common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of NumberCo, with NumberCo becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.
On
March 17, 2020, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company approved a
1-for-10 reverse stock split of the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”) , and on March 18, 2020, the Company filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock
Split. The Reverse Stock Split became effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 19, 2020, and the Company’s common stock
began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on March 20, 2020. Accordingly, all common stock and per share data are
retrospectively restated to give effect of the split for all periods presented herein.
On
August 10, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Gold King Acquisition
Corp. (“Acquisition Corp.”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Northern Panther Resources Corporation (“Northern
Panther” or “NPRC”) and the Stockholder Representative named therein, pursuant to which Acquisition Corp. merged with
and into NPRC, with NPRC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The
Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property,
as defined in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”) promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable mineral reserves and all activities are
exploratory in nature.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation and principles of consolidation
The
accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-Q, and the rules
and regulations of SEC for interim financial information, which includes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
presents the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of January 31,
2023. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accounting policies and procedures used in the preparation
of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company
for the year ended April 30, 2022, which are contained in the Form 10-K filed on August 15, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of January 31, 2023 was derived from those financial statements. It is management’s opinion that all material
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.
Operating results during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
year ending April 30, 2023.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions
In
preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period
then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not
limited to, valuation of mineral rights, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock, valuation of warrant liability, asset
retirement obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
(“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition
for fair value to be applied in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
These
inputs are prioritized below:
Level
1:
Observable
inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2:
Observable
market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level
3:
Unobservable
inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s
(“FASB”) accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in
their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The
Company’s warrant liability for warrants issued in March 2022 (see Note 9) was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using
Level 3 inputs.
Prepaid
expenses and other current assets
Prepaid
expenses and other current assets of $ 463,928
and $ 787,902
at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, consist primarily of
costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments
for consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance premiums, mining claim fees, drilling fees, easement fees, options
fees, and mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.
Property
Property
is carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized.
When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains
or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life of the assets, generally
three
to
five years .

Impairment
of long-lived assets
The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s
estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not recognize any impairment during the three and nine months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022.
Mineral
Rights
Costs
of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral
exploration costs as incurred. Where the Company has identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of its properties, development
costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) the Company receives the requisite operating permits, b)
completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from the Board authorizing the development of the ore body. Until all these
criteria have been met the Company records pre-development costs to expense as incurred.
When
a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven
and probable reserves following the commencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties
for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”, and evaluates its carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive
Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount
of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value.
To
date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above
for capitalization.
ASC
930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights
consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include
mineral rights.
Acquired
mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value
as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral
rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.
ASC
930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:
●
The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining
the fair value of the assets.
●
The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of
market participants.
Leases
to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASU 2016-02, “Leases”.
Share-Based
Compensation
Share-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”),
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award.

Accounting
for Warrants
Warrants
are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC
815”) as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments, depending on the specific terms of the agreements. The Company
classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of
net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as assets or
liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs
and if that event is outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement
in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Instruments that are classified as liabilities are recorded at fair value at
each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the
consolidated statements of operations.
The
Company assessed the classification of its outstanding common stock purchase warrants except for the warrants issued in March 2022 (see
below) as of the date of issuance and determined that such instruments met the criteria for equity classification under the guidance
in ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Feature”. The Company has no outstanding warrants that
contain a “down round” feature under Topic 815 of ASU 2017-11.
Warrant
Liability
The
Company accounts for the 625,000 warrants issued in March 2022 in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. ASC 815 concluded
that the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company
classifies these warrant instruments as a liability at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period.
This liability will be re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value
will be recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo
simulation model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.
Offering
Costs
Offering
costs incurred consisted of legal, placement agent fees and other costs that were directly related to registered direct offerings. Offering
costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the registered direct offering based on a relative fair value basis,
compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs associated with warrant liability were expensed as incurred, presented as offering
costs related to warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the sale of common shares
were charged against equity.
Remediation
and Asset Retirement Obligation
Asset
retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated reclamation costs at the Company’s CK Gold, Keystone
and Maggie Creek properties, are recognized in the period incurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities
at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over
time through charges to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. AROs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company
reviews and evaluates its AROs annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary.
Foreign
Currency Transactions
The
reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains and
losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency included
in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments, and transaction gains or losses, have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company and are included in general and administrative expenses.

Leases
The
Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), the Company has elected the ‘package of practical
expedients’, which permits it not to reassess under the standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification
and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company elects not to apply ASC Topic 842 to arrangements with lease terms of 12 months or
less. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represent the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating
lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional
years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be reviewed for re-measurement. Lease expense for minimum
lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the
statements of operations.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”),
which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets
for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.
The
Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions” (“ASC 740-10”).
When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be
ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements
in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions.
Tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than
50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with
tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company
has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed
penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense.
The
Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine
whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a
tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished.
For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position
is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations
remains open. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and
state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
–
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which
is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general
principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This ASU became effective and
the Company adopted the guidance during fiscal 2022. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have
an effect on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security
and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account,
recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities
subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had cash
of approximately $ 5.3
million, working capital of approximately $ 5.2
million which consists primarily of cash and an accumulated deficit
of approximately $ 63.6
million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in operating activities of approximately $ 5.7
million and $ 6.4
million, respectively, for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities,
and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company’s primary source
of operating funds since inception has been equity financings. As of the date of filing the Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31,
2023, the Company has sufficient cash to fund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken
project activities related to permitting and engineering studies. However, in order to advance any of its projects past the aforementioned
objectives, the Company does not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES
On
May 1, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for its lease facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The term of the lease is for a two-year
period from May 2021 to May 2023 starting with a monthly base rent of $ 1,667 . The Company has an option to renew the lease for an additional
three years
beyond the primary term. The Company typically excludes options to extend the lease in a lease term unless it is reasonably
certain that the Company will exercise the option and when doing so is in the Company’s sole discretion. The base rent is subject
to an annual increase as defined in the lease agreement. In addition to the monthly base rent, the Company is charged separately for
common area maintenance which is considered a non-lease component. These non-lease component payments are expensed as incurred and are
not included in operating lease assets or liabilities.
On January 30, 2023, the Company entered into a lease amendment effective as of
May 1, 2023 to extend this lease for a period of one year expiring April 30, 2024 with an option to renew the lease for an additional
one year term.
The monthly base rent will be $ 1,768 . The Company accounted for the lease extension as a lease modification under ASC
842. On January 30, 2023, the effective date of modification, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease
liability in the amount of $ 20,472
based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of
8 % .
On
September 1, 2021, the Company entered into another lease agreement for its lease facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The term of the lease
is for a two-year period from September 2021 to August 2023.
The monthly base rent was $ 3,100
and was lowered to $ 2,950
starting in March
2022. The Company has an option to renew the lease for an additional

WARRANT LIABILITY
As
of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company’s warrants liability was valued at $ 1,675,000
and $ 2,440,000 , respectively.
Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. As such, these warrants are recorded
at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations as “Change in fair value of warrant liability” until the warrants are exercised, expired
or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders’ equity. The Company utilized a
Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair value of the March 2022 warrants, which incorporates significant inputs that are not
observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring
the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value by using the following key inputs to the Monte
Carlo Simulation Model:

NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY
31, 2023
At
any time during the Option Term, the Company may exercise the Option by providing a written notice to the Landowner and the Company shall
pay a one-time right of way payment of $ 26,240
at closing and shall execute a lease agreement. The exclusive option to lease (the “Lease”)
and right of way (the “Right of Way”) is for a term of ten years with the right to extend for an additional ten years and
requires an annual lease payment of $ 50,000 , compensation for loss of grazing of $ 40.00
per acre impacted land and annual Right of Way
payments of $ 13,120 .
In
consideration for the option rights, lease rights and right of way rights under this Agreement, the Company agreed to grant the Landowner
shares of the Company’s common stock worth $ 50,000 , which shares will not vest, or be issued, until the Company executes the Lease.
Currently, the Company has not executed the Lease.
At
any time during the Option Term, the Company may terminate this Agreement by providing a written notice to the Landowner. Upon termination,
the Landowner is entitled to retain any payments already made and the Company shall have no further obligation after the date of termination.
The Agreement, including the Option and the Exploration Access Rights, may be extended for a period of five years upon written notice
from the Company. In the absence of such notice, the Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the Option Term. Currently,
the Company has not exercised the Option.
Legal
Matters
From
time to time the Company may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To the Company’s
knowledge, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of the Company’s property
is the subject.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by U.S. Gold Corp. (the “Company”,
“we”, “us”, or “our”) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in interim unaudited
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”), which are duplicate to the disclosures in the audited consolidated financial statement have been omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto in the Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 filed with the Commission.
In
the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring adjustments and consolidating entries, necessary
to present fairly the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial position of us and our subsidiaries as of January 31, 2023,
the results of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022. The results of unaudited interim condensed consolidated operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results for the full year.
The
preparation of interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Forward-Looking
Statements
In
addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our results and the timing of selected events may
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including the risk factors
described in this report and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April
30, 2022.
Overview
U.S.
Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey
in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed
its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”),
in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company.
We are a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. We own certain mining leases and
other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold project in Idaho.
Our CK Gold Project contains proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 where we are conducting exploration and pre-development
activities, and all of our activities on our other properties are exploratory in nature.
On
March 17, 2020, we filed a certificate of amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to
effectuate a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock per share on a one-for-ten basis, effective as of 5:00 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on March 19, 2020. All share and per share values of our common stock for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the reverse stock splits.
Summary
of Activities for the three months ended January 31, 2023
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023, we focused primarily on continued progress in the preparation and support of necessary permits
for our CK Gold Project and further engineering studies towards the completion of a feasibility study.
An
overview of certain significant events during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 are as follows:
●
On
November 9, 2022, we assigned our interest in the Exploration Earn-in Agreement for the Maggie Creek property to NGM and received
$2.75 million in cash from NGM plus we have the potential to retain a 0.5% Net Smelter Returns royalty on the Maggie Creek property
if certain conditions are met.
23
●
On
November 16, 2022, we received notification from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) that they had
successfully performed the requisite completeness review of our application submission. Accordingly, the steps of public notice and
WDEQ’s technical review will commence.
●
On
November 22, 2022, Ryan Zinke notified us of his intent to resign from our Board effective December 31, 2022 (the “Effective
Date”). Mr. Zinke was re-elected to our Board at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 16, 2022 and served as
a director until the Effective Date. Following the Effective Date, our board is comprised of five members.
●
On
December 20, 2022, we announced the re-election of the then current six directors (Luke Norman, George Bee, Ryan Zinke, Robert Schafer,
Tara Gilfillan and Michael Waldkirch), to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors
have been duly elected and qualified.

offset by an increase in legal fees of $17,000 and an increase in accounting fees of $10,000 and (iv) a decrease in general and administrative

We reported loss from operations of approximately $2,268,000 and $4,335,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Other

2023 and 2022, respectively. We reported an increase in the fair value of the warrant liability of approximately $389,000 and $0 for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We
also reported gain from sale of asset of $763,393 for each of the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 related to the Assignment
and Assumption Agreement dated on November 9, 2022.
24
Net
Loss
We
reported a net loss of approximately $5,736,000 and $12,178,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We
reported a net loss of approximately $1,894,000 and $4,335,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at January 31, 2023 compared to April 30, 2022, and
the changes between those periods:
January 31, 2023
April 30, 2022
Increase (decrease)
Current Assets
$ 5,746,512
$ 9,899,414
$ (4,152,902 )
Current Liabilities
$ 515,346
$ 1,136,035
$ (620,689 )
Working Capital
$ 5,231,166
$ 8,763,379
$ (3,532,213 )
As
of January 31, 2023, we had working capital of $5,231,166, as compared to working capital of $8,763,379 as of April 30, 2022, a decrease
of $3,532,213.
We
are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently
implemented by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies,
including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between $175,000 and $250,000 in legal and accounting
expenses annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results
of operations.
Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP
and have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses in the amounts
of approximately $5.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $5.3 million, working
capital of approximately $5.2 million, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $63.6 million. Our primary source of operating funds
since inception has been equity financings. As of January 31, 2023, we have sufficient cash to fund our corporate activities and general
and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve
months. However, in order to advance any of our projects past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will
need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve
months following the issuance of these financial statements.
We
have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including potential acquisitions, changes in exploration programs
and related studies and other operating strategies. In addition, we continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may
adversely affect our ability to obtain additional future capital. To the extent we require additional funding, we cannot be certain that
additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities,
our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact
our ability to conduct business. If unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, scale
back or discontinue the exploration activities or programs.
Cash
Used in Operating Activities
Net
cash used in operating activities totaled $6.4 million and $9.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 decreased primarily due to net changes in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities as compared to the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the decrease in fair value of the warrant liability
of $765,000 and gain from sale of asset of $763,000. Additionally, we expensed approximately $1,385,000 in total stock-based compensation
for shares, RSU’s, stock options issued to officers, employee, and consultants during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as
compared to approximately $1,686,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. Net changes of approximately $609,000 in operating assets
and liabilities are primarily due to a decrease of approximately $600,000 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
25
Cash
Used in Investing Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities was $2,572,487 primarily from proceeds received from the sale of Maggie Creek of $2,750,000 related
to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated on November 9, 2022 offset by $177,513 primarily for the purchase of property and equipment
for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to approximately $178,972 primarily for purchase of property and equipment for
the nine months ended January 31, 2022.
Cash
Provided by Financing Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were both $0.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
As
of January 31, 2023, we did not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently
issued accounting pronouncements.
Critical
Accounting Policies
There
have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended January 31, 2023. Critical accounting
policies and the significant accounting estimates made in accordance with such policies are regularly discussed with the Audit
Committee of the Company’s Board. Those policies are discussed under “Critical Accounting Policies” in our
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7, as
well as Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year
ended April 30, 2022, filed with the Commission on August 15, 2022 and amended on August 29, 2022.
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of, and with the participation
of, the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a–15(e) and Rule 15d–15(e)
of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in applicable rules and forms due to the material
weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in the Company’s
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, under the heading “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting”.
(b)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; however, management has determined that for
the sake of transparency and conservancy, it cannot state that internal controls over financial reporting are effective at this time.
While
present in the Company’s design of internal controls, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure
are not written; however, the operation of many controls are in place and are applied on a consistent basis. Company personnel perform
controls standards to: 1) approve all Company expenditures, 2) approve and sign contractual obligations, 3) reconcile bank accounts and
other general ledger accounts, 4) review of complex accounting items, and 5) many other similar rudimentary controls applied as best
practice. Historically, management has concluded that due to the Company’s small size and limited personnel available to perform
control functions, the Company is precluded from applying adequate segregation of duties in financial transactions. These are material
weaknesses common to companies of similar size and staffing in the Company’s industry. The Company has engaged an independent firm
to assist with the design, implementation, documentation and testing of internal controls. The Company expects these material weakness
conditions to continue for the foreseeable future, or until significant Company growth results in additional personnel to perform financial
functions.

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are
no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.
Item
1A. RISK FACTORS .
As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.
Item
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
There
were no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that were not previously reported on a Current Report
on Form 8-K.
Item
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES .
None.
Item
4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Pursuant
to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other
mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These
reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration
(“MSHA”). During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company and its properties or operations were not subject to
regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
