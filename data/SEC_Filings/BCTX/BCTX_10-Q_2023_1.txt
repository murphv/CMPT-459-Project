Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
NOTE
1:
GENERAL
a.
BriaCell
Therapeutics Corp. (“BriaCell” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British
Columbia) on July 26, 2006 and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “BCT” and
on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “BCTX” and “BCTXW”.
b.
BriaCell
is an immuno-oncology biotechnology company. BriaCell owns the US patent to Bria-IMT™, a whole-cell cancer vaccine (US Patent
No.7674456) (the “Patent”). The Company is currently advancing its immunotherapy program, Bria-IMT™, to complete
a 24-subject Phase I/IIa clinical trial and by research activities in the context of BriaDx™, a companion diagnostic test to
identify patients likely benefitting from Bria-IMT™.
c.
Basis
of presentation of the financial statements:
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain
information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or
omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management,
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature,
which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report
for the year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on October 28 , 2022. The interim period results do not necessarily indicate the
results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year.
Prior
to 2021, the Company prepared its financial statements, including its condensed financial statements, in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as permitted in the United States
based on the Company’s qualification as a “foreign private issuer” under the rules and regulations of the SEC. In connection
with the loss of the Company’s status as a foreign private issuer effective on August 1, 2022, the Company, as a domestic filer,
prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and restated its condensed consolidated financial statements
as of January 31, 2022 to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
d.
The
Company continues to devote substantially all of its efforts toward research and development activities. In the course of such activities,
the Company has sustained operating losses and expects such losses to continue in the foreseeable future. The Company’s accumulated
deficit as of January 31, 2023 was $ 73,338,140
and negative cash flows from operating activities during the six-month period ended
January 31, 2023 was $ 7,494,122 . The Company is planning to finance its operations from its existing and future working capital resources
and to continue to evaluate additional sources of capital and financing. The Company believes that its existing capital resources
will be adequate to satisfy its expected liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the issuance of the condensed consolidated
financial statements.
8
e.
The
Company has a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (“BTC”), which was incorporated in April 3, 2014,
under the laws of the state of Delaware. BTC has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapientia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Sapientia”
and together with BTC the “Subsidiaries”), which was incorporated in September 20, 2012, under the laws of the state
of Delaware. The Company has one operating segment and reporting unit.
f.
Since
January 2020, the Coronavirus outbreak has dramatically expanded into a worldwide pandemic creating macro-economic uncertainty and
disruption in the business and financial markets. Many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States have been
taking measures designated to limit the continued spread of the Coronavirus, including the closure of workplaces, restricting travel,
prohibiting assembling, closing international borders and quarantining populated areas. Such measures present concerns that may dramatically
affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business effectively.
The
Company may face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials if patients are affected
by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the outbreak of COVID-19. In the event
that clinical trial sites are slowed down or closed to enrolment in our trials, this could have a material adverse impact on our
clinical trial plans and timelines. The Company is continuing to assess its business plans and the impact COVID-19 is having on the
Company’s clinical trial timelines and the Company’s ability to recruit candidates for clinical trials. The extent to
which COVID-19 and global efforts to contain its spread will impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions
taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak. The Company currently believes that the execution of our clinical trials and
research programs are delayed by at least one quarter due to COVID-19.
NOTE
2:
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a.
Use of estimates :
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company’s management believes
that the estimates, judgment and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements,
and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
b.
Recently issued and adopted accounting standards :
As
an “emerging growth company,” the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) allows the Company to delay
adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to
private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below
reflects this election. The pronouncements below relate to standards that impact the Company.
1.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326), Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and requires
a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The guidance will be effective
for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. Effective August 1, 2021, the Company
early adopted ASU 2016-13. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
9
2.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). The final guidance issued by the FASB for convertible instruments eliminates two of the three
models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Separate accounting is still required in
certain cases. Additionally, among other changes, the guidance eliminates some of the conditions for equity classification in ASC
815-40-25 for contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance also requires entities to use the if-converted method for all
convertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and include the effect of share settlement for instruments
that may be settled in cash or shares, except for certain liability-classified share-based payment awards. ASU 2020-06 is effective
for the company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Effective August 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2020-06.
Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
3.
In
November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government
Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring
the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of
the assistance on a business entity’s financial statements. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for
annual periods beginning after 15 December 2021. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material
impact on the financial statements.
NOTE

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS
a.
Legal
proceedings:
On
May 19, 2021, Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”) filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court, Commercial Division, New
York County against BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (“BriaCell”), alleging that BriaCell breached a loan contract when it refused
to reprice and extend the term of warrants purported held by Alpha in spring 2021, seeking monetary and injunctive relief for delivery
of those amended warrants. Counterclaiming and defending against Alpha’s complaint, BriaCell alleges that Alpha’s loan to
BriaCell is unenforceable both because the loan is criminally usurious under New York law and because Alpha acted as an unregistered
securities dealer in violation of American securities law. BriaCell also has alleged that Canadian securities law, regulation, and rules
prohibited it from amending the warrants to comply with Alpha’s spring 2021 demands. On May 11, 2022, Alpha moved to dismiss BriaCell’s
operative Amended Counterclaim. At oral argument on January 19, 2023, Justice Cohen granted in part and
denied in part Alpha’s partial motion to dismiss BriaCell’s Amended Counterclaim and Affirmative Defenses. In relevant part,
Justice Cohen refused to dismiss any of BriaCell’s substantive counterclaims, allowing BriaCell to continue to prosecute its Unjust
Enrichment, Money Had and Received, Recovery of Excess, and Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing claims against Alpha. At this
time, the parties cannot estimate the value of their respective claims and damages.

The
Company is currently on a month-to-month lease arrangement for office and lab space in Philadelphia, PA, in the amount of approximately

We
classify our cash and cash equivalents and the liability in respect of publicly traded warrants within Level 1 because we use quoted
market prices in active markets.
The
fair value of the warrant liability for non-public warrants is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that
are observable for the liability either directly or indirectly, and thus are classified as Level 2 financial instruments.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
a.
On
August 2, 2022, the Company approved an omnibus equity incentive plan (“Omnibus Plan), which will permit the Company to grant
incentive stock options, preferred share units, restricted share units (“RSU’s”), and deferred share units (collectively,
the “Awards”) for the benefit of any employee, officer, director, or consultant of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company. The maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan shall not exceed
15 % of the issued and outstanding
Shares, from time to time, less the number of Shares reserved for issuance under all other security-based compensation arrangements
of the Company, including the existing Stock Option Plan. On February 9, 2023, the Omnibus Plan was approved by the shareholders
and remains subject to final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic
net income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for each reporting period by the weighted-average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) for each reporting period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, plus
dilutive potential ordinary shares considered outstanding during the period, in accordance with ASC No. 260-10 “Earnings Per
Share”. The Company experienced a loss in three and six month ended January 31, 2023 and for the six months ended January 31,
2022; hence all potentially dilutive ordinary shares were excluded during those periods due to their anti-dilutive
effect.

Overview
BriaCell (the “ Company ”) is an
immuno-oncology biotechnology company with a strong focus on cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight
against cancer since they harness the body’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. BriaCell owns the U.S. patent
to SV-BR-1-GM (“ Bria-IMT™ ”), a whole-cell targeted immunotherapy for cancer (U.S. Patent No. 7,674,456), as well
as patents related to PKCδ inhibitors (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,364,460 and 9,572,793). The Company is currently advancing our targeted
immunotherapy program by prioritizing a Phase I/IIa clinical trial with Bria-IMT™ in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor
and a companion diagnostic test, BriaDx™, to identify patients most likely to benefit from Bria-IMT™. The Bria-IMT™
regimen was evaluated in four patients in a prior study in 2004-2006 by Dr. Charles Wiseman, the scientific founder, former member of
the board of directors of the Company (the “ Board ”) and principal scientific advisor. Encouraging results were obtained,
especially in a patient who matched Bria-IMT™ at HLA alleles and had a grade II tumor. In 2017-2018 BriaCell evaluated 23 patients
with advanced breast cancer with the Bria-IMT™ regimen and obtained confirmation of the ability of the Bria-IMT™ regimen to
induce regression of metastatic breast cancer in patients who match Bria-IMT™ at least at one HLA allele and/or if they had grade
I or grade II tumors. A combination study with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) was initiated on September
2018. BriaCell purchased the KEYTRUDA® for this study as BriaCell does not have an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. for the supply
of KEYTRUDA®. Eleven patients were dosed in the combination therapy trial with Bria-IMT™ and the immune checkpoint inhibitor
KEYTRUDA® and subsequently dosing with this combination was discontinued. The study was modified under an amended protocol which evaluates
the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with Incyte Corporation experimental drugs retifanlimab (anti-PD-1 antibody similar to
pembrolizumab). The study is ongoing.
16
It
is estimated by the National Cancer Institute that in 2022, approximately 287,500 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the United
States. That means that every two minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 43,000 died in 2022. Although
about 100 times less common than in women, breast cancer also affects men. It is estimated that the lifetime risk of men getting breast
cancer is about 1 in 1,000, and the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 2,710 new cases of invasive male breast cancer
will be diagnosed and approximately 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2022.
According to the May 2019 “Global Oncology Trends
2021” report by the IQVIA Institute, the global market for cancer drugs (including immunotherapy drugs) is expected to reach nearly
$269 billion by the end of 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“ CAGR ”) of 10% between 2021 and 2025, of
which about 20% is expected to be immuno-oncology drugs.
About 12.9% percent of women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. In 2018, there were an estimated 3,676,262 women living with female breast cancer in
the United States. Approximately 81% of cases present as invasive breast cancer. Approximately 6% of new breast cancer diagnoses are Stage
IV (metastatic breast cancer (“ MBC ”), which has already spread to other organs). Twenty to thirty percent of all women
diagnosed with breast cancer will develop MBC. Breast cancer can be subdivided based on receptor status - the hormone receptors for estrogen
(ER) and progesterone (PR), collectively referred to as hormone receptors (HR), and the Her2/neu growth factor co-receptor (HER2). Based
on the latest SEER statistics, 74.6% were found to be HR+/HER2−, 10.8% were triple-negative (HR−/HER2−), 10.5% were
HR+/HER2+, and 4.0% were HR−/HER2+. 1
It
is estimated that over 150,000 women in the US are living with MBC. For those with metastatic disease at diagnosis, their 5-year survival
rate is 27%. For patients who develop MBC after initially having localized disease, if they had a good response to treatment (i.e. a
disease-free interval of more than 24 months), their survival rate is similar to that of patients with MBC at initial diagnosis, but
if their disease-free interval is less than 24 months, their prognosis is worse. 4
We currently propose that the Bria-IMT™
indication will be for the treatment of patients with MBC who have failed other approved therapies. Similarly, another study showed that
the median overall survival among patients with de novo stage IV MBC was 39.2 months, while for patients with relapsed disease it was
27.2 months. Median progression free survival after first-line therapy is only 9 months and the survival benefit decreases with subsequent
lines of therapy. One study showed that of 386 patients with MBC, 374 (97%) received first-line therapy, 254 (66%) received second-line
therapy, 175 (45%) received third-line therapy, and 105 (27%) received therapy beyond third-line.
Recent
Developments
On
August 4, 2022, the Company announced that it has secured an exclusive license from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) to
develop and commercialize Soluble CD80 (sCD80) as a biologic agent for the treatment of cancer.
The novel technology, originally developed by Suzanne
Ostrand-Rosenberg, Ph.D., Emeritus Faculty at UMBC, and member of BriaCell’s scientific advisory board, is titled “Soluble
CD80 as a Therapeutic to Reverse Immune Suppression in Cancer Patients” and covered under USPN 8,956,619 B2, USPN 9,650,429 B2,
and USPN 10,377,810 B2. In animal models, sCD80 was well-tolerated and stopped tumor growth by potentially restoring natural anti-tumor
immunity (see Lucas A Horn, et al. and Samuel T Haile et al. in collaboration with Dr. Ostrand-Rosenberg). Additionally, strong anti-tumor
activity of sCD80 has been reported in multiple tumor types (see Lucas A Horn, et al.). Importantly, as demonstrated in the same studies,
sCD80’s unique actions may involve both awakening and boosting the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells.
17
Under
the terms of the agreement, BriaCell gains the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize sCD80, while UMBC maintains ownership of
the patents. BriaCell will pay royalties to UMBC upon the commercialization of the product plus patent management costs. The licensing
agreement was coordinated by UMBC’s Office of Technology Development.
Bria-IMT™
regimen combined with Incyte’s retifanlimab
The
Company’s data showed clinical benefit including extended survival time and tumor reductions in heavily pre-treated advanced breast
cancer patients who matched our lead candidate, Bria-IMT™, at HLA type/s, and these findings guided the development of further
optimized off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies for advanced breast cancer and other cancers.
On
September 14, 2022, the Company signed an agreement with Caris Life Sciences® (Caris), a leading molecular
science and technology company actively developing and delivering innovative solutions to revolutionize healthcare.
The
goal is to develop immunotherapies that are personalized for each patient, and Caris’ extensive library of clinical data, cutting-edge
biomarker technology, and expertise will be invaluable in achieving our objectives,” The Company expects Caris’ unique platform
to help us identify patients who do not respond to existing treatments and are more likely to benefit from the Company’s immunotherapy
treatments.
Under
the terms of the agreement, Caris will help BriaCell with efficient patient identification, accelerating enrollment for its current Phase
I/II clinical trial in advanced metastatic breast cancer of certain genetically defined subgroups. The partnership between BriaCell and
Caris leverages Caris’ Right-In-Time (RIT) Clinical Trial Network, a group of over 495 oncology sites that are able to quickly
identify and enroll eligible patients in biomarker-directed clinical trials. This service offers patients and physicians access to the
most cutting-edge precision medicine in development. Additionally, through Caris’ comprehensive molecular profiling (Whole Exome
and Whole Transcriptome Sequencing), Caris will perform tumor profiling for the patients enrolled in the clinical trial.
On
October 12, 2022, the Company added Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida as a clinical site in the Phase I/II study of
BriaCell’s lead candidate, Bria-IMT™, with Incyte’s PD-1 inhibitor, retifanlimab, in advanced breast cancer.
On
November 10, 2022, the Company announced positive initial efficacy data in its 2021-2022 cohort of 12 advanced breast cancer patients.
Disease control, tumor shrinkage, and potential survival benefit were observed amongst 12 patients in the Phase I/IIa clinical study
of Bria-IMT™ in combination with Incyte’s retifanlimab.
●
Bria-IMT™
regimen in combination with Incyte’s retifanlimab produced evidence of disease control, tumor shrinkage, and potential survival
benefit amongst BriaCell’s recent 12 patient cohort in advanced breast cancer.
●
The
regimen remains well tolerated as recently reported in Phase I evaluation.
●
70%
of patients showed either disease control or progression-free survival (PFS) benefits compared with their last therapy.
●
Prior
to enrollment, the 12 patients in the cohort had already been unsuccessfully heavily pre-treated with at least 2 prior therapy regimens,
further underscoring BriaCell’s positive patient outcomes.
18
In
summary, these findings show evidence of clinical and survival benefits in heavily pre-treated advanced breast cancer patients, suggesting
an additive or synergistic effect of Bria-IMT™ in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, and supporting the strategy of using the Bria-IMT™
combination regimen with retifanlimab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer patients.
Evidence
of immune system activation by Bria-OTS+™ and Bria-PROS™
BriaCell’s
poster presentation highlights the development details and activities of BriaCell’s next generation (enhanced version) off-the-shelf
personalized immunotherapies.
BriaCell
has recently developed its novel next generation off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies, including Bria-OTS+™, and Bria-PROS™,
that are designed to produce several immune activating molecules in addition to their original immune activating mechanisms for increased
efficacy. This represents a significant advancement in BriaCell’s novel off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy technology.
Both
Bria-OTS+™ for advanced breast cancer, and Bria-PROS™ for advanced prostate cancer, were able to activate naïve T cells,
suggesting their potential capabilities to produce very strong immune responses in patients. Results show that the very strong immune
responses observed may be due to: 1) direct activation of the components of the immune system such as naïve T cells, and 2) indirect
activation of the immune system components via production of immune activating molecules.
BriaCell
is impressed with the data showing very strong immune responses for both Bria-OTS+™ and Bria-PROS™. We expect both Bria-OTS+™
and Bria-PROS™ to boost the immune system response and produce strong anti-tumor responses in patients with advanced breast cancer
and prostate cancer, respectively.

Issuance
On
January 10, 2023, the Company announced that it received an Issue Notification from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for
the composition of matter and method of use of its personalized off-the-shelf cell-based immunotherapy for cancer. The patent issued
on January 24, 2023 as US Patent No. 11,559,574 with the term extending to May 25, 2040. Additionally, BriaCell was awarded an Australian
patent (Patent No. 2017224232, extends to February 27, 2037) covering composition of matter and method of use for its whole-cell cancer
immunotherapy technology in Australia.
Intellectual Property:
US
Patent No. 11,559,574, titled “Whole-cell cancer vaccines and methods for selection thereof,” will issue on January 24, 2023,
and covers the composition of matter and method of use of BriaCell’s personalized off-the-shelf whole-cell immunotherapies. The
novel technology involves the development of several HLA specific whole-cell immunotherapies in advance, and selection of the appropriate
off-the-shelf (i.e. pre-made) immunotherapies for each patient (i.e. personalized therapy) based on the patient’s HLA type using
a fast and easy saliva test. Once issued, the patent will provide intellectual property protection through May 25, 2040, and a patent
term extension under Hatch-Waxman potentially applies (which would extend such protection for an additional five years).
Additionally, BriaCell was awarded
Australian Patent No. 2017224232, titled “Whole-cell cancer vaccines and methods for selection thereof,” for claims covering
composition of matter and method of use for BriaCell’s whole-cell immunotherapy for cancer in Australia.

End
of Phase II Meeting with the Food and Drug Administration
On
January 18, 2023 BriaCell received agreement and positive feedback from its End of Phase II meeting with the FDA regarding
BriaCell’s lead clinical candidate, Bria-IMT™ in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (under Fast Track designation),
in advanced metastatic breast cancer.
BriaCell
and the FDA have agreed on the primary end point, the essential elements of the study design, and the type of patients to be enrolled
in BriaCell’s upcoming pivotal clinical study. This pivotal registration study will be enrolling advanced metastatic breast cancer
patients for whom no approved treatment options exist.
Registration
study success could lead to a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for the approval of the combination regimen for commercialization
in advanced metastatic breast cancer.
Updated
Clinical Data
On
Feb. 23, 2023 BriaCell reported updated survival data from its previously disclosed group of 12 patients (11 patients enrolled in 2021/2022)
in the ongoing Phase II clinical trial evaluating Bria-IMT™ in combination with Incyte’s retifanlimab for the treatment of
advanced metastatic breast cancer.
9
of 11 (82%) patients remain alive from 2021/2022 dosing, suggesting strong survival benefits.
7
of 11 (64%) patients showed either disease control or progression-free survival (“PFS”) benefits compared with their
most recent prior therapy regimen suggesting clinical benefit, including survival and delayed cancer progression in this very
difficult to treat patient population.
Median PFS of 3.5 months (with one subject ongoing)
compares favorably with other recent studies of patients with advanced disease including other approved agents in earlier lines of therapy
(Tripathy “ATTAIN” 2022, Perez 2015 “BEACON”, Cortes 2018, O’Shaughnessy 2022 “ASCENT”).
Regimen
remains well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities.
This
clinical data from BriaCell’s combination regimen highlights survival benefits in a cohort (3 rd
line or later) with
a life expectancy of merely months or weeks in some cases. Patients in this cohort had failed a median of 5 other treatments prior to
enrolling in BriaCell’s study. Other reportable benefits such as less pain and better quality of life were also observed in these
patients.
Subsets
of top-responding patients: 4 of 5 patients with Grade I/II cancer, and 6 of 8 hormone receptor positive (HR+) patients had either disease
control or improved PFS suggesting potentially better responding subgroup/s of patients. These subgroups represent large segments of
the advanced breast cancer patient population.
Enrollment
update: 9 additional patients have been screened/enrolled in the study, incremental to the 12 patients announced in December 2022. With
patients continuing to enroll and remain on the treatment, more data including overall survival data will be disclosed at regular intervals.

Going
Concern Uncertainty
The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The continuing operations of the Company are dependent
upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future.
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company has total assets of $34,161,267 (July 31, 2022 - $42,577,041) and a positive working capital balance
of $33,268,148 (July 31, 2022 -$41,405,613).
The
Company is planning to finance its research and developmental activities from its existing and future working capital resources and will
continue to evaluate additional sources of capital and financing. The Company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate
to satisfy its expected liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company has working capital of $33,268,148 (July 31, 2022 - $41,405,613) and an accumulated deficit of $73,338,140
(July 31, 2022 - $60,349,837).
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company’s capital resources consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, comprising mostly of cash
on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities,
and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting
our liquidity requirements.
Historically,
the Company has financed its operation through private and public placement of equity securities, as well as debt financing. The Company’s
ability to fund its longer-term cash requirements is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company intends
to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes
that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so.
There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a
going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement
a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be
no assurance that such a plan will be successful
During
the six-month period ended January 31, 2023, the Company’s overall position of cash and cash equivalents decreased by $14,481,449
from the six-month period ended January 31, 2022 (including effects of foreign exchange). This decrease in cash can be attributed to
the following:
The
Company’s net cash used in operating activities during the six-month period ended January 31, 2023, was $7,494,122, as compared
to $4,334,808 for the six-month period ended January 31, 2022.
Cash
used in financing activities for the six-month period ended January 31, 2023, was $47,294, as compared to $4,952,192 for the six-month
period ended January 31, 2022.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
The
Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable, investments, trade payable , and accrued
expenses and other payables. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant
interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying
values, unless otherwise noted.
Management
understands that the Company is exposed to financial risk arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility
of these rates as a portion of the Company’s transactions occur in Canadian Dollars (mainly costs relating to being a public company
in Canada), and the Company’s functional and presentation currency is the US dollar. The Company does not use derivative instruments
to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The
Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of Directors approves and monitors
the risk management process. The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Company’s competitiveness and flexibility.
The
type of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is as follows:
Credit
risk
The
Company has no significant concentration of credit risk arising from operations. Management believes that the credit risk concentration
with respect to financial instruments is remote.
Liquidity
Risk
The
Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities as they come
due. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has total assets of $34,161,267 (July 31, 2022 - $42,577,041) and a positive working capital
balance of $33,368,149 (July 31, 2022 –$41,405,613).
Market
Risk
Interest
rate risk
Interest
Rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company
does not believe it is exposed to material interest rate risk as it has no interest-bearing debt.
Price
risk
As
the Company has no revenues, price risk is remote.
26
Exchange
risk
The
Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a portion of the Company’s transactions occur in Canadian Dollars (mainly costs
relating to being a public company in Canada) and, therefore, the Company is exposed to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting
period through its Canadian denominated trade payable and cash. As of January 31, 2023, a 5% depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian
dollar against the US dollar would not have a material effect on the in total loss and comprehensive loss.
Fair
Values
The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable, trade payable, and accrued expenses and other payables approximate
their fair values due to their short terms to maturity.
The
cash and cash equivalents are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.

management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer have concluded that as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We continue to
implement plans that are improving these material weaknesses, including implementation of independent review and approval of transactions
and reconciliations in certain processes through hiring additional personnel and segregating duties amongst our team. We are instituting
processes to document and retain evidence to support reviews and reconciliations.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2023, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except for our remediation
efforts described above.
PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings.
On May 19, 2021, Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”)
filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court, Commercial Division, New York County against BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (“BriaCell”),
alleging that BriaCell breached a loan contract when it refused to reprice and extend the term of warrants purported held by Alpha in
spring 2021, seeking monetary and injunctive relief for delivery of those amended warrants. Counterclaiming and defending against Alpha’s
complaint, BriaCell alleges that Alpha’s loan to BriaCell is unenforceable both because the loan is criminally usurious under New
York law and because Alpha acted as an unregistered securities dealer in violation of American securities law. BriaCell also has alleged
that Canadian securities law, regulation, and rules prohibited it from amending the warrants to comply with Alpha’s spring 2021
demands. On May 11, 2022, Alpha moved to dismiss BriaCell’s operative Amended Counterclaim. At oral argument on January 19, 2023, Justice Cohen granted in part and
denied in part Alpha’s partial motion to dismiss BriaCell’s Amended Counterclaim and Affirmative Defenses. In relevant part,
Justice Cohen refused to dismiss any of BriaCell’s substantive counterclaims, allowing BriaCell to continue to prosecute its Unjust
Enrichment, Money Had and Received, Recovery of Excess, and Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing claims against Alpha. At this
time, the parties cannot estimate the value of their respective claims and damages.
27
The
Company disagrees with Alpha’s claims, is defending these claims, and has filed a counter claim. At this time, whilst it is impossible
to provide any guarantee as to the outcome of the lawsuit, it is the Company’s assessment, based on advice from the Company’s
legal counsel at this time, and based on the information known by the Company, that it is more likely than not that BriaCell will not
have to pay Alpha in the litigation.
