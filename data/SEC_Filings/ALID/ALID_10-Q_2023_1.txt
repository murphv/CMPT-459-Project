Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   1. Nature of operations, reverse take-over transaction and going concern   a) Nature of operations   Allied Corp. (the “Company or Allied”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 3, 2013. On July 1, 2019, the Company changed its name to Allied Corp. The head office and the registered office of the Company are located at 1405 St. Paul Street, Kelowna BC V1Y 2E4.   The Company’s business plan is to discover new medical technologies some of which are cannabis derived to target full scope therapy and support for trauma survivors, military veterans and first responders, however the Company has not begun such operations nor obtained the required permits to begin such operations.   On February 18, 2020, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding share capital of a Colombian company, Allied Colombia S.A.S (“Allied Colombia”). The assets, liabilities and results of Allied Colombia are consolidated in these financial statements beginning from the February 18, 2020 acquisition date. As at November 30, 2022, Allied Colombia has a licensed cannabis farm in Colombia.   b) Going concern   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended November 30, 2022 of $ 1,309,541 , has generated minimal revenue and as at November 30, 2022 has a working capital deficit of $ 5,813,082 . These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to raise sufficient financing to acquire or develop a profitable business. Management intends on financing its operations and future development activities largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including related party loans until such time that funds provided by future planned operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.   c) COVID-19 impact   In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and the related adverse public health developments have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to uncertainty and an economic downturn. Although some product distribution was delayed by COVID-19, management has determined that there has been no significant impact to the Company’s operations, however management continues to monitor the situation.   d) Business Risks   While some states in the United States have authorized the use and sale of cannabis, it remains illegal under federal law and the approach to enforcement of U.S. federal laws against cannabis is subject to change. The Company plans to engage in cannabis-related activities in the United States, only if and when cannabis operations are federally legalized.     9 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   On January 4, 2018, the then United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to United States district attorneys (the “Sessions Memorandum”) which rescinded previous guidance from the United States Department of Justice specific to cannabis enforcement in the United States, including the Cole Memorandum. With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, United States federal prosecutors no longer have guidance relating to the exercise of their discretion in determining whether to prosecute cannabis related violations of United States federal law. Since that time, United States district attorneys have taken no legal action against state law compliant entities, and the Biden administration is generally anticipated to seek federal decriminalization of state legal cannabis activity. Nevertheless, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to the Company. The Company may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change.   Given the current illegality of cannabis under United States federal law, the Company’s ability to access both public and private capital may be hindered by the fact that certain financial institutions are regulated by the United States federal government and are thus prohibited from providing financing to companies engaged in cannabis related activities. The Company’s ability to access public capital markets in the United States is directly hindered as a result. The Company may, however, be able to access public and private capital markets in the United States through institutions which are not regulated by the United States federal government, in Canada, and in many other countries in order to support continuing operations.
2. Significant accounting policies   Business Presentation   These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), and are expressed in United States dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is August 31.   These interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended August 31, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.   The consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at November 30, 2022, and the results of its operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and cash flows for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The results of operations for the period ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year.   The significant accounting policies followed are:   a) Principles of consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include accounts of Allied Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including AM Biosciences, Allied US Products LLC, Tactical Relief LLC, Baleno Ltd. and Allied Colombia. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition and control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee. All intercompany balances, income, expenses, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation.     10 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)
b) Cash and cash equivalents   Cash is comprised of cash on hand, cash held in trust accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities within three months when acquired. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022.   c) Property, plant and equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates and methods:     Farm facility and equipment
1
-
10
years straight-line basis   Office and computer equipment
5
-
10
years straight-line basis   Land equipment 10
years straight-line basis
d) Inventory   Inventory is comprised of raw materials, supplies, vegetative and flowering plants, dried flower, diluted crude and CBD isolates available for sale, and purchased cannabis products.   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined using weighted average cost. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of inventory and records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand, production requirements, market conditions, regulatory environment, and spoilage. Actual inventory losses may differ from management’s estimates and such differences could be material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of net loss and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows.   e) Intangible assets   Intangible assets include licenses which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of
10
years. The Company’s licenses are amortized over their economic or legal life on a straight-line basis, whichever is shorter. The licenses have been amortized from the date of acquisition.   The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.   For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.     11 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)
f) Long-lived assets   In accordance with ASC 360,
Property, Plant and Equipment , the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.   g) Foreign currency translation and functional currency conversion   Items included in these consolidated financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate (the “functional currency”).   Prior to September 10, 2019, the Company’s functional currency was the Canadian dollar. Translation gains and losses from the application of the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency during the period that the Canadian dollar was the functional currency are included as part of cumulative currency translation adjustment, which is reported as a component of shareholders’ equity under accumulated other comprehensive loss.   The Company re-assessed its functional currency and determined as at September 10, 2019, its functional currency changed from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar based on management’s analysis of changes in our organization. The change in functional currency was accounted for prospectively from September 10, 2019 and prior period financial statements were not restated for the change in functional currency.   For periods commencing September 10, 2019, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Opening balances related to non-monetary assets and liabilities are based on prior period translated amounts, and non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities incurred after September 10, 2019 are translated at the approximate exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Revenue and expense transactions are translated at the approximate exchange rate in effect at the time of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as foreign exchange gains.   The Company assessed the functional currency for Allied Colombia to be the Colombian peso. The functional currency for all other subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.   h) Share issuance costs   Costs directly attributable to the raising of capital are charged against the related share capital. Costs related to shares not yet issued are recorded as deferred share issuance costs. These costs are deferred until the issuance of the shares to which the costs relate, at which time the costs will be charged against the related share capital or charged to operations if the shares are not issued.   i) Research and development costs   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.     12 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)
j) Advertising costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred advertising costs of $ 3,026
(November 30, 2021 – $ 258,683 ) which was included as a part of office and miscellaneous expense.   k) Revenue recognition   The Company’s revenue is comprised of sales of cannabis products.   The Company’s revenue-generating activities have a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product transfers and the Company’s obligations have been fulfilled. This generally occurs when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms set forth in the customer contract. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the sale of the Company’s product. Certain of the Company’s customer contracts may provide the customer with a right of return. In certain circumstances the Company may also provide a retrospective price adjustment to a customer. These items give rise to variable consideration, which is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon the expected amounts of the product returns and price adjustments at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that the Company make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue recognized.   Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. The Company’s payment terms vary by location and customer; however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. The Company estimates and reserves for its bad debt exposure based on its experience with past due accounts and collectability, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and an analysis of customer data.   l) Net income (loss) per common share   Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share . The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding to the extent the effect would not be antidilutive. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.   Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.   m) Income taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,
Income Taxes . Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.     13 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   n) Related party transactions   Related parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment, ownership or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. The Company discloses related party transactions that are outside of normal compensatory agreements, such as salaries. Related party transactions are measured at the exchange amounts.   o) Significant accounting estimates and judgments   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although management uses historical experience and its best knowledge of the amount, events or actions to for the basis for judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.   The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future periods.   Significant estimates and assumptions included in these financial statements relate to the valuation assumptions related to the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Judgments are required in the assessment of the Company’s ability to continue to as going concern as described in Note 1.   p) Financial instruments   ASC 825,
Financial Instruments , requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:   Level 1 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.   Level 3 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   The financial instruments consist principally of cash, due from related parties, accounts payable, note payable, and convertible notes payable. The fair value of cash when applicable is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all other financial instruments which are categorized as loans and receivables approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or current market rates of interest for similar instruments.   For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts payable, due from related parties, notes and loans payable, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to the short maturities.   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.     14 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   q) Leases   The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease in whole or in part at the inception of the contract. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. All leases with terms greater than twelve months result in the recognition of a ROU asset and a liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Unless a lease provides all of the information required to determine the implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company uses the implicit interest rate in the lease when readily determinable.   Our lease terms include all non-cancelable periods and may include options to extend (or to not terminate) the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with terms of twelve months or less at the commencement date are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability. See Note 7 – Leases.   r) Embedded Conversion Features   The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion features. On September 1, 2022 the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method and reviewed and calculated the impact on the outstanding financial instruments as of this adoption date concluding there was no impact.   s) Reverse Acquisitions   Identification of the accounting acquirer   The Company considers factors in ASC 805-10-55-10 through 55-15 in identifying the accounting acquirer. The Company uses the existence of a controlling financial interest to identify the acquirer - the entity that obtains control of the acquiree. Other pertinent facts and circumstances also shall be considered in identifying the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity interests, including the following: (a) The relative voting rights in the combined entity after the business combination, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined entity taking into consideration the existence of any unusual or special voting arrangements and options, warrants, or convertible securities; (b) the existence of a large minority voting interest in the combined entity if no other owner or organized group of owners has a significant voting interest, and where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose single owner or organized group of owners holds the largest minority voting interest in the combined entity; (c) the composition of the governing body of the combined entity, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners have the ability to elect or appoint or to remove a majority of the members of the governing body of the combined entity; (d) the composition of the senior management of the combined entity, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose former management dominates the management of the combined entity; and (e) the terms of the exchange of equity interests, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity that pays a premium over the pre-combination fair value of the equity interests of the other combining entity or entities, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose relative size (measured in, for example, assets, revenues, or earnings) is significantly larger than that of the other combining entity or entities.     15 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 805-40-05-2, as one example of a reverse acquisition, a private operating entity may arrange for a public entity to acquire its equity interests in exchange for the equity interests of the public entity. In this situation, the public entity is the legal acquirer because it issued its equity interests, and the private entity is the legal acquiree because its equity interests were acquired. However, application of the guidance in ASC 805-10-55-11 through 55-15 results in identifying: (a) The public entity as the acquiree for accounting purposes (the accounting acquiree); and (b) the private entity as the acquirer for accounting purposes (the accounting acquirer).   Measuring the consideration transferred   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-30-2 and 30-3 in a reverse acquisition, the accounting acquirer usually issues no consideration for the acquiree. Instead, the accounting acquiree usually issues its equity shares to the owners of the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree. The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts (see ASC 805-40-45-2(a)).   Presentation of consolidated financial statements post reverse acquisition   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-45-1 and 45-2, consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) but described in the notes as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer), with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree). The consolidated financial statements reflect all of the following: (a) The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts; (b) the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in Topic 805 “Business Combinations”; (c) the retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination; (d) the amount recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) determined in accordance with the guidance in this topic applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the combination.   Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition; and (e) the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the legal subsidiary’s (accounting acquirer’s) pre-combination carrying amounts of retained earnings and other equity interests as discussed in ASC 805-40-25-2 and 805-40-30-3.   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-45-4 and 45-5, in calculating the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings-per-share (“EPS”) calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs: (a) The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of that period to the acquisition date shall be computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of the legal acquiree (accounting acquirer) outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement; and (b) the number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of that period shall be the actual number of common shares of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree) outstanding during that period.     16 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition shall be calculated by dividing (a) by (b): (a) The income of the legal acquiree attributable to common shareholders in each of those periods; and (b) the legal acquiree’s historical weighted average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement.   As a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholders of AMBI, for financial statement reporting purposes, the asset acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition with AMBI deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-10-55 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The reverse acquisition is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of AMBI (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company (the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the acquisition. The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of AMBI which are recorded at their historical cost. The equity of the Company is the historical equity of AMBI.   These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, AM Biosciences effective from the date of the reverse take—over transaction on September 10, 2019 and Allied Colombia (from the date of acquisition, February 18, 2020). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.   t) Recent accounting pronouncements   The Company does not expect that recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended November 30, 2022, are of significance or potential significance to the Company.   3. Inventory   Inventory is comprised of the following items:       November 30,
2022     August 31,
2022                 Work in progress   $ 258,666     $ 326,556   Finished goods     592,838       383,459   Inventory in transit     337,459       288,973   Total inventory   $ 1,188,963     $ 998,988     The costs of inventory include but are not limited to labor, utilities, nutrition and irrigation, overhead and the depreciation of manufacturing equipment and production facilities, and amortization of licenses determined at normal capacity. Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and rent of grow facility. The Company began production in Colombia in late 2020, when the Company obtained approval for its strains of products. During the current period, certain costs were determined based on the actual usage of production space as compared to the normal predetermined operational production of the facility based on capacity as the Company gradually started to grow products and prepared the facility ready. Management determined that during the current period, the Company was operating at 57% of predesigned capacity and as a result 57% of rent, amortization expenses, and certain overhead costs are included in costs of inventory.   During the current period, the Company recorded a $nil (August 30, 2022 - $ 31,737 ) write-off of inventory costs for products purchased for resale to reduce inventory to its net realizable value of $ 1,188,963
(August 30, 2022 - $ 998,988 ).     17 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   4. Deposits and advances       November 30,

(August 31, 2022 - $ 2,656,695 ) to purchase prefabricated buildings. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had not yet received the buildings and the amounts have been recorded as deposits.   b) At November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company had paid $ 150,000
to acquire a license through an asset purchase agreement as described in Note 20(a). At November 30, 2022, the asset purchase has not closed and the amount paid has been recorded as a deposit.   c) The Company paid certain vendors for the construction of farm facilities in Colombia in advance. As at November 30, 2022, the prepayments totaled $ 47,460 .

Net carrying value
$     August 31, 2022

of licenses as part of the acquisition of Allied Colombia. The licenses acquired are issued by the Republic of Colombia and include the use of seeds for growing Cannabis, production of derivatives from Cannabis for medicinal and scientific use, cultivation of Cannabis plants, and producer of seeds. The Company recorded amortization of these licenses of $ 658,836
for the year ended August 31, 2021, of which $ 158,121
was included in cost of inventory.   Management acquired the licenses with a plan to operate in Colombia and believed the amounts paid for the licenses would be recovered from future operations. The Company has only recently started its operations in Colombia and has limited history on which to base future outcomes from operations including cash flows. Cannabis and hemp are considered to be an emerging industry and Colombia does not yet have a sufficiently established observable legal market in which the Company could sell its Cannabis or hemp flower and CBD or THC extracts. Laws and regulations in Colombia are evolving and there is uncertainty in what will be legally permissible in a future market and what prices and demand there would be in Colombia for the Company’s products. At the present, the Company’s export activities are regulated and restricted by Colombian law and it is uncertain whether future changes in law would favorably impact the Company’s operations. Due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future cash flows from operations the Company has written down its licenses to the estimated recoverable amount. During the year ended August 31, 2021, the Company recorded impairment of intangible assets in the amount of $ 2,687,695 .   During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded amortization of $ 2,951
(COP 13,860,163) (2021 - $ 1,436
(5,499,837 COP)).   7. Leases   The Company accounts for leases under ASC 842,
Leases , which establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The Company also elected to keep all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet.   The Company did not have any leases until the acquisition of Allied Colombia during the year ended August 31, 2020. The acquisition resulted in the addition of $ 82,398
of operating lease assets and liabilities. During the year ended August 31, 2021, the Company re-measured its lease liabilities under this lease as the criteria was met for additional monthly payment when the Company started production as outlined in the lease agreement, resulting in additional lease liabilities of $ 70,705 .   On August 10, 2021, the Company entered into another lease for additional land in Colombia with monthly payment of $ 2,647
(COP9,970,675) for 12.5 hectares which is intended for use of outdoor cultivation, resulting in additional lease liabilities of $ 104,902 . The lease is for
5
years, and expires in July 2026. Management has assessed the lease as an operating lease.     19 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)
The Company entered into an agreement to lease the land described in 14(e) with a commencement date of June 1, 2020. The lease requires the Company to make monthly payments of $ 4,501
(CAD$5,870) per month. The lease is for a 10-year term, expiring on
May 31, 2030 , with one
10 -year renewal option and an option for the Company to purchase the land for approximately $ 920,000
(CAD$1,200,000). Effective November 1, 2020, the Company terminated the lease. Pursuant to ASC 842-20 upon the termination of the lease, the Company derecognized the lease related asset and liability and included any consideration paid or received upon termination that was not already included in the lease payments in the gain or loss on termination of the lease. After recording the proceeds from the landlord and derecognizing the capitalized building costs as well as the right of use asset and liability, the Company recorded a loss of $ 65,565
on the termination of the lease.   ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the ROU asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the ROU asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the ROU asset results in front-loaded expense over the lease term. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. At November 30, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases.   At November 30, 2022, the weighted average remaining operating lease term was
6
years and the weighted average discount rate associated with operating leases was

Secured convertible notes payable
The Company has granted each and every of the secured convertible note holders a continuing security interest in, a general lien upon, and a right of set-off against all existing and future assets and property under the terms of a security agreement.     a) On January 23, 2020, the Company issued two convertible notes with principal amounts of $ 400,000
and $ 200,000 , respectively, with a total face value of $ 600,000
(the “Notes”) and warrants to purchase
240,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at $ 1.25
per share for
1
year. The Notes were issued with an original discount of $ 12,000 , and bear interest at 10% per annum compounded monthly. The notes mature on July 20, 2020 and are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $ 1.25
per share.     21 Table of Contents   ALLIED CORP. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   The Company determined that there was no derivative liability associated with the Notes or warrants under ASC 815-15,
Derivatives and Hedging . Per ASC 815-10-15-74(a), contracts that are both indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity in its statement of financial position are not considered to be derivative instruments. The conversion features are indexed to the Company’s own stock and are classified in stockholders’ equity in the Company’s statement of financial position. As the conversion features would meet the scope exception as described in paragraphs ASC 815-15-74(a), the conversion features are not required to be separated from the host instrument and accounted for separately. As a result, at November 30, 2022, the conversion features and warrants do not meet derivative classification.   The relative fair values of the convertible notes and the warrants were $ 470,467
and $ 117,533
respectively. The effective conversion price was then determined to be $ 0.98 . As the stock price at the issuance date was greater than the effective conversion price, it was determined that there was a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). The Company recognized the relative fair value of the BCF of $ 115,383
and an equivalent discount. The Company then recognized the relative fair value of the warrants of $ 108,100
as additional-paid-in capital and an equivalent discount that further reduced the carrying value of the convertible debt to $ 364,517 . The beneficial conversion feature of $ 115,383 , the original issue discount of $ 12,000
and the relative fair value of the warrants of $ 108,100
discounted the carrying value of the convertible debt on the date of issue. The discount is being expensed over the term of the loan to increase the carrying value to the face value of the loan using effective interest rate method. On June 30, 2020, the Company repaid $ 200,000
of the $ 600,000
note which left $ 200,000
outstanding on each note.   i. First Modification:   On July 1, 2020, the Company entered into amendments to the convertible notes. Pursuant to the amendments, the convertible notes bear simple interest at
5 % per annum. The maturity date of the convertible notes was amended to due on demand on or before October 31, 2020. In consideration for extending the maturity date, the Company issued to the convertible note holders
16,000
common shares of the Company and warrants to purchase additional
320,000
common shares of the Company at $ 1.25
per share expiring October 31, 2021. Each note holder received

As the common shares and warrants were issued as consideration for extending the convertible notes, the fair value of the common share and warrants of $ 218,397
were expensed under extinguishment accounting. The fair value of these costs were included in the calculation of the loss on extinguishment of $ 220,065 .   ii. Second Modification:   On November 1, 2020, the Company entered into amendments to the convertible notes.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements November 30, 2022 (Expressed in US dollars)   12. Financial risk factors   The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of Directors approves and monitors the risk management processes, inclusive of documented investment policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:   a) Credit risk:   Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash account. Cash accounts are held with major banks in Canada. The Company has deposited its cash with a bank from which management believes the risk of loss is low.   b) Liquidity risk:   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. Accounts payable are due within the current operating period. The Company has a working capital deficit and requires additional financing to meet its current obligations (see Note 1).   c) Market risk:   Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. The Company is not exposed to market risk.   d) Interest rate risk:   Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk, from time to time, on its cash balances. Surplus cash, if any, is placed on call with financial institutions and management actively negotiates favorable market related interest rates.   e) Foreign exchange risk:   Foreign currency risk is limited to the portion of the Company’s business transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The Company has not entered into any foreign currency contracts to mitigate risk, but manages the risk my minimizing the value of financial instruments denominated in foreign currency. The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that the following monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars:       November 30, 2022   Balance in Canadian dollars:     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 20,119   Accounts receivable     5,088   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities     ( 759,049 ) Net exposure     ( 733,842 ) Balance in US dollars:   $ ( 543,264 )   A
10 % change in the US dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate would impact the Company’s net loss by approximately $ 54,326
for the three months ended November 30, 2022 (August 31, 2022 – $ 53,595 ).

for the three months ended November 30, 2022 (August 31, 2022 - $ 49,281 ).   13. Capital management   The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, based on the funds available to the Company, in order to support the business and continue as a going concern. The Company considers capital to be all accounts in equity. The Board of Directors does not establish quantitative return on capital criteria for management, but rather relies on the expertise of the Company’s management to sustain future development of the business. The Company has a working capital deficit and requires additional capital to finance is future business plans. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.   14. Commitments
a) As of November 30, 2022, the Company recorded a contingent liability of $ 547,190

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report.   The following discussion highlights the Company’s results of operations and the principal factors that have affected its consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based upon Allied Corp’s unaudited financial statements contained in this Current Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.   Overview   Allied Corp. (“Allied” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation, based in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. Allied is an international medical cannabis production company with a mission to address today’s medical issues by researching, creating and producing targeted cannabinoid health solutions. Allied uses what it considers to be an evidence-informed scientific approach to make this mission possible, through cutting-edge pharmaceutical research and development, innovative plant-based production and unique development of therapeutic products.   References in this periodic report on Form 10-Q to “Allied” or the “Company” may include references to the operations of our subsidiaries AM (Advanced Micro) Biosciences, Inc., Allied Colombia S.A.S., Baleno Ltd., Tactical Relief, LLC, and Allied US Products, LLC. Each of these corporations is a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of Allied and consequentially reports quarterly financials up to a consolidated quarterly submission.   Allied’s focus is on the development of medicinal cannabis and psilocybin products for patients with conditions potentially suitable for treatment therewith. Such conditions include anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, chronic pain, epilepsy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Parkinson’s disease, Tourette syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI)1.   Allied’s objective is to be a company that controls its own international vertically integrated supply chain or CBD, cannabis, and psilocybin products in order to maximize cash flow and profit margins. Our management team believes that having control over our supply chain should enable us to provide a consistent, rolling-harvest supply to the global cannabis community.   Given the average cost of production in North America being approximately $1.00 to $2.00 per gram, we believe our anticipated significantly lower cash cost of cannabis production based on historical production of our operations and other companies growing raw flowers in Columbia afforded by our Colombian production and cultivation should provide us a competitive advantage.   In addition to what we consider our demonstrated ability to cultivate low-cost, high margin cannabis in Colombia primarily for use in proprietary cannabinoid drug and natural health products for international distribution, we have hemp derived CBD natural health products for sale in the United States, have received commercial approval for sale of medical cannabis being produced in Colombia for export to nations other than the United States, and have initiated human clinical phase I trial for our psilocybin-based pharma products ALID 11, ALID 12 and Psilonex™ which are protected under provisional patent and trademarks in the United States.     51 Tables of Contents   Effects of COVID-19   In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and the related adverse public health developments have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. While COVID-19 delayed shipment of some of our products, management has determined that there has been no significant impact to the Company’s operations, however management continues to monitor the situation.   Critical Accounting Policies
Business Presentation   The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), and are expressed in United States dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is August 31.   The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended August 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.   The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at November 30, 2022, and the results of its operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and cash flows for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The results of operations for the period ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year.   The significant accounting policies followed are:   Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include accounts of Allied Corp. and its majority owned subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition and control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee. All intercompany balances, income, expenses, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation.   Cash and cash equivalents   Cash is comprised of cash on hand, cash held in trust accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities within three months when acquired. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022.   Property, plant and equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates and methods:     Equipment
10 years straight-line basis   Office and computer equipment 5 years straight-line basis   Land equipment
10 years straight-line basis
Inventory   Inventory is comprised of raw materials, supplies, vegetative and flowering plants, dried flower, diluted crude and CBD isolates available for sale, and purchased cannabis products.   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined using weighted average cost. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of inventory and records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand, production requirements, market conditions, regulatory environment, and spoilage. Actual inventory losses may differ from management’s estimates and such differences could be material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of net loss and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows.     52 Tables of Contents   Intangible assets   Intangible assets include licenses which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. The Company’s licenses are amortized over their economic or legal life on a straight-line basis, whichever is shorter. The licenses have been amortized from the date of acquisition.   The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.   For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.   Long-lived assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.   Foreign currency translation and functional currency conversion   Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate (the “functional currency”).   Prior to September 10, 2019, the Company’s functional currency was the Canadian dollar. Translation gains and losses from the application of the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency during the period that the Canadian dollar was the functional currency are included as part of cumulative currency translation adjustment, which is reported as a component of shareholders’ equity under accumulated other comprehensive loss.   The Company re-assessed its functional currency and determined as at September 10, 2019, its functional currency changed from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar based on management’s analysis of changes in our organization. The change in functional currency was accounted for prospectively from September 10, 2019 and prior period financial statements were not restated for the change in functional currency.   For periods commencing September 10, 2019, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Opening balances related to non-monetary assets and liabilities are based on prior period translated amounts, and non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities incurred after September 10, 2019 are translated at the approximate exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Revenue and expense transactions are translated at the approximate exchange rate in effect at the time of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as foreign exchange gains.   The Company assessed the functional currency for Allied Colombia to be the Colombian peso. The functional currency for all other subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.   Share issuance costs   Costs directly attributable to the raising of capital are charged against the related share capital. Costs related to shares not yet issued are recorded as deferred share issuance costs. These costs are deferred until the issuance of the shares to which the costs relate, at which time the costs will be charged against the related share capital or charged to operations if the shares are not issued.   Research and development costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.     53 Tables of Contents   Advertising costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.   Revenue recognition   The Company’s revenue is comprised of sales of cannabis products.   The Company’s revenue-generating activities have a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product transfers and the Company’s obligations have been fulfilled. This generally occurs when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms set forth in the customer contract. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the sale of the Company’s product. Certain of the Company’s customer contracts may provide the customer with a right of return. In certain circumstances the Company may also provide a retrospective price adjustment to a customer. These items give rise to variable consideration, which is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon the expected amounts of the product returns and price adjustments at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that the Company make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue recognized.   Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. The Company’s payment terms vary by location and customer; however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. The Company estimates and reserves for its bad debt exposure based on its experience with past due accounts and collectability, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and an analysis of customer data.   Net income (loss) per common share   Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding to the extent the effect would not be antidilutive. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.   Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.   Income taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.   Related party transactions   Related parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment, ownership or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. The Company discloses related party transactions that are outside of normal compensatory agreements, such as salaries. Related party transactions are measured at the exchange amounts.   Significant accounting estimates and judgments   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although management uses historical experience and its best knowledge of the amount, events or actions to for the basis for judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.   The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future periods.   Significant estimates and assumptions included in these financial statements relate to the valuation assumptions related to the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Judgments are required in the assessment of the Company’s ability to continue to as going concern.     54 Tables of Contents   Financial instruments   ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:   Level 1 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.   Level 3 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   The financial instruments consist principally of cash, due from related parties, accounts payable, note payable, and convertible notes payable. The fair value of cash when applicable is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all other financial instruments which are categorized as loans and receivables approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or current market rates of interest for similar instruments.   For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts payable, due from related parties, notes and loans payable, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to the short maturities.   The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented on the Company’s balance sheet as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022 other than cash.   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.   Leases   The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease in whole or in part at the inception of the contract. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. All leases with terms greater than twelve months result in the recognition of a ROU asset and a liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Unless a lease provides all of the information required to determine the implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company uses the implicit interest rate in the lease when readily determinable.   Our lease terms include all non-cancelable periods and may include options to extend (or to not terminate) the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with terms of twelve months or less at the commencement date are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability.   Embedded Conversion Features   The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion features. On September 1, 2022 the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method and reviewed and calculated the impact on the outstanding financial instruments as of this adoption date concluding there was no impact.     55 Tables of Contents   Reverse Acquisitions   Identification of the accounting acquirer   The Company considers factors in ASC 805-10-55-10 through 55-15 in identifying the accounting acquirer. The Company uses the existence of a controlling financial interest to identify the acquirer - the entity that obtains control of the acquiree. Other pertinent facts and circumstances also shall be considered in identifying the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity interests, including the following: (a) The relative voting rights in the combined entity after the business combination, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined entity taking into consideration the existence of any unusual or special voting arrangements and options, warrants, or convertible securities; (b) the existence of a large minority voting interest in the combined entity if no other owner or organized group of owners has a significant voting interest, and where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose single owner or organized group of owners holds the largest minority voting interest in the combined entity; (c) the composition of the governing body of the combined entity, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners have the ability to elect or appoint or to remove a majority of the members of the governing body of the combined entity; (d) the composition of the senior management of the combined entity, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose former management dominates the management of the combined entity; and (e) the terms of the exchange of equity interests, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity that pays a premium over the pre-combination fair value of the equity interests of the other combining entity or entities, where the acquirer usually is the combining entity whose relative size (measured in, for example, assets, revenues, or earnings) is significantly larger than that of the other combining entity or entities.   Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 805-40-05-2, as one example of a reverse acquisition, a private operating entity may arrange for a public entity to acquire its equity interests in exchange for the equity interests of the public entity. In this situation, the public entity is the legal acquirer because it issued its equity interests, and the private entity is the legal acquiree because its equity interests were acquired. However, application of the guidance in ASC 805-10-55-11 through 55-15 results in identifying: (a) The public entity as the acquiree for accounting purposes (the accounting acquiree); and (b) the private entity as the acquirer for accounting purposes (the accounting acquirer).   Measuring the consideration transferred   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-30-2 and 30-3 in a reverse acquisition, the accounting acquirer usually issues no consideration for the acquiree. Instead, the accounting acquiree usually issues its equity shares to the owners of the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree. The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts (see ASC 805-40-45-2(a)).   Presentation of consolidated financial statements post reverse acquisition   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-45-1 and 45-2, consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) but described in the notes as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer), with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree). The consolidated financial statements reflect all of the following: (a) The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts; (b) the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in Topic 805 “Business Combinations”; (c) the retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination; (d) the amount recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) determined in accordance with the guidance in this topic applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the combination.   Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition; and (e) the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the legal subsidiary’s (accounting acquirer’s) pre-combination carrying amounts of retained earnings and other equity interests as discussed in ASC 805-40-25-2 and 805-40-30-3.     56 Tables of Contents   Pursuant to ASC 805-40-45-4 and 45-5, in calculating the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings-per-share (“EPS”) calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs: (a) The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of that period to the acquisition date shall be computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of the legal acquiree (accounting acquirer) outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the merger agreement; and (b) the number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of that period shall be the actual number of common shares of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree) outstanding during that period.   The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition shall be calculated by dividing (a) by (b): (a) The income of the legal acquiree attributable to common shareholders in each of those periods; and (b) the legal acquiree’s historical weighted average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement.   As a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholders of AMBI, for financial statement reporting purposes, the asset acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition with AMBI deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-10-55 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The reverse acquisition is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of AMBI (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company (the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the acquisition. The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of AMBI which are recorded at their historical cost. The equity of the Company is the historical equity of AMBI.   These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, AM Biosciences effective from the date of the reverse take—over transaction on September 10, 2019 and Allied Colombia (from the date of acquisition, February 18, 2020). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.   Recent accounting pronouncements   The Company does not expect that recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended November 30, 2022, are of significance or potential significance to the Company.   Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended November 30, 2022 of $1,315,436, has generated minimal revenue and as at November 30, 2022 has a working capital deficit of $5,818,977. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to raise sufficient financing to acquire or develop a profitable business. Management intends on financing its operations and future development activities largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including related party loans until such time that funds provided by future planned operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.   Results of Operations   Comparison of Unaudited Results for the Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 compared to the Three Months Ended November 30, 2021   Sales
For the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, we had $69,625 in revenue compared to $19,178 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021. This reflects an increase in the sale of our cannabis flower products as part of our current plan for growth and revenues.   Gross margin   For the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, the Company had a gross margin of $43,667 compared to a negative gross margin of $243,739 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021. The negative gross margin was due to an inventory write-off of 252,639 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021.     57 Tables of Contents   Expenses   For the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, we had total expenses of $1,239,916, compared to total expenses of $10,048,903 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021. Of the total expenses for 2022, a total of $1,242,966 (2021 – $9,635,577) was operating expenses and the remainder was non-recurring expenses which included, interest expense of $83,199 (2021 – $56,732), and loss on debt extinguishment of $27,043 (2021 – nil). The operating expenses consisted principally of consulting fees in the development of the Company’s cannabis business, general office expenses, professional fees and rent.   Net Loss   For the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $1,309,541 compared to a net loss of $10,068,081 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021. This was principally related to the expenses referenced in the previous paragraph.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table sets forth the major components of our statements and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented.       Three Months

Such formation could be through additional equity offerings, debt, bank financings or a combination of any source of financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in completion of such financings.     59 Tables of Contents   Plan of Operations   As noted above, the continuation of our current plan of operations requires us to raise significant additional capital. If we are successful in raising capital through the sale of convertible notes or common shares, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our plan of operations through 2023. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail and possibly cease some operations. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for operating capacity in Colombia, Canada and the United States, regulatory compliance, intellectual property, working capital and general corporate purposes.   We continually evaluate our plan of operations to determine the manner in which we can most effectively utilize our limited cash resources. The timing of completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the availability of cash to implement that aspect of the plan and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain the required capital or revenues, or, if obtained, that the amounts will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations.   Capital Expenditures   As of November 30, 2022 the company had purchased property plant and equipment of $1,397,466 and paid net cash of $2,854,155 in deposits for an asset acquisition. As of August 31, 2022 the company had purchased property plant and equipment of $1,444,038 and paid net cash of $2,869,825 in deposits for an asset acquisition.   MediColombias Acquisition (Colombia Licensed Producer)
On August 29, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with Dorson Commercial Corp. (“Dorson”) as the sole owner of Baleno Ltd. to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Baleno Ltd., the sole owner of Medicolombia Cannabis S.A.S. (“Medicolombia”). Medicolombia is based in Colombia with a full set of licenses and a lease agreement in place to begin production on a 5 hectare parcel of land. We have the ability to scale production to over hundreds of hectares. This is located in the area of Bucamaranga, Colombia.   This acquisition includes a team of experts and significant expenditures spent on an irrigation holding pond, security towers, fencing, etc. to meet the Colombia minister of justice and minister of agriculture requirements.   Pursuant to the agreement the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Medicolombia in exchange for $700,000 and 4,500,000 shares of Allied. The Company closed and completed the acquisition on February 17, 2020. Medicolombia has subsequently changed its name to Allied Colombia S.A.S.   Natural Health Products Acquisition
In May 2019 the management team of AM Biosciences were able to negotiate the inclusion of a natural health products catalogue of products. This includes 50 products in the natural health vertical market. Three of these products are of particular interest as they have Natural Health Products registration numbers with Health Canada. AM Biosciences can add these to the product offerings both in Canada and the United States.   Xtreme Cubes Building
In June 2019, AM Biosciences signed the production and manufacturing contract to begin the manufacturing of the full building initially intended for the Canada extraction and production facility.   The Company determined to utilize these building assets in connection with our potential United States operations in the State of Nevada upon on the occurrence or waiver of the changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event”). In connection with that determination, our wholly owned subsidiary, Allied US Products LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, entered into a contingent asset purchase agreement (the “Contingent Asset Purchase Agreement”) which allows for the purchase of a Nevada State US-based cannabis license from a subsidiary of Fiore Cannabis, Ltd. (“Fiore Subsidiary”). We also entered into a 25 year land lease with the Fiory Subsidiary which we intended to use for this operation.   We will only conduct business activities related to growing or processing cannabis in jurisdictions, including the United States, when it is federally permissible to do so. While we have several arrangements with United States based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve us in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis.   When complete, the building will be a fully scalable, modular building. A portion of the building was delivered to the property on the land lease. In early December 2022, the Company was advised that the Fiore Subsidiary had become insolvent and that a trustee’s sale had been scheduled for the property which the Company had leased. In order to protect the Company’s interests, the Company filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada again the Fiore Subsidiary, the creditor bringing the trustee’s sale and the trustee, seeking injunctive relief to terminate the trustee’s sale or alternatively money damages. The Company filed a lis pendens against the property to reflect this complaint and to protect its interests in the building. The Trustee’s sale went forward and the successful bidder was the underlying creditor. Subsequently the Company has been amicably working with that bidder to enable return of the building and equipment on the property.     60 Tables of Contents   The Company made an upfront payment of $230,000 USD in June 2019, an additional payment of $903,385 in August 2019 and an additional payment of$92,000 in March 2020. At November 30, 2022, Company had deposits of $2,656,695 (August 31, 2022 - $2,656,695) to purchase prefabricated buildings. As of November 30, 2022, the building had not yet been fully delivered and the amounts have been recorded as deposits.   Commitments and Contractual Obligations   As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.   Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.   Going Concern   As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $36,242,206 at November 30, 2022 and a net loss of $1,309,541 for the three months ended November 30, 2022.   The Company does not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of convertible notes and equity securities. In addition, the Company has generated no revenues since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   The ability of the Company to continue operations is dependent on the success of Management’s plans, which include the raising of capital through the issuance of equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.   The Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.   Our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of November 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Because of limitations in our operations in Colombia there were significant and material adjustments for audits and reviews of financial statements, and most of them are recurring adjustments. These adjustments indicate material weaknesses in certain cycles, including but not limited to inventory and costing, and financial reporting.    This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permits us to provide only management’s report in this quarterly report.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .   As a result of accounting issues in Colombia, we have engaged new accounting personnel in Colombia to improve our accounting and controls and procedures in that segment of our operations. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period from August 31, 2022 through November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     61 Tables of Contents   PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   In June 2019, AM Biosciences signed the production and manufacturing contract to begin the manufacturing of the full building initially intended for the Canada extraction and production facility.   The Company had determined to utilize these building assets in connection with our potential United States operations in the State of Nevada upon on the occurrence or waiver of the changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event”). In connection with that determination, our wholly owned subsidiary, Allied US Products LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, entered into a contingent asset purchase agreement (the “ Contingent Asset Purchase Agreement”) which allows for the purchase of a Nevada State US-based cannabis license from a subsidiary of Fiore Cannabis, Ltd. (“Fiore Subsidiary”). We also entered into a 25 year land lease with the Fiory Subsidiary which we intended to use for this operation.   We will only conduct business activities related to growing or processing cannabis in jurisdictions, including the United States, when it is federally permissible to do so. While we have several arrangements with United States based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve us in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis.   When complete, the building will be a fully scalable, modular building. A portion of the building was delivered to the property on the land lease. In early December 2022, the Company was advised that the Fiore Subsidiary had become insolvent and that a trustee’s sale had been scheduled for the property which the Company had leased. In order to protect the Company’s interests, the Company filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada again the Fiore Subsidiary, the creditor bringing the trustee’s sale and the trustee, seeking injunctive relief to terminate the trustee’s sale or alternatively money damages. The Company filed a lis pendens against the property to reflect this complaint and to protect its interests in the building. The Trustee’s sale went forward and the successful bidder was the underlying creditor. Subsequently the Company has been amicably working with that bidder to enable return of the building and equipment on the property.   We are not aware of any other legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties,   As of the date of this report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings.
