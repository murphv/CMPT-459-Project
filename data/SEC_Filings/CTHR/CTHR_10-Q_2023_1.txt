NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Charles & Colvard, Ltd. (the “Company”), a North Carolina corporation, was founded in 1995. The Company manufactures, markets, and distributes
Charles
& Colvard Created Moissanite ®
(hereinafter referred to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and finished jewelry featuring
moissanite, including
Forever One™ , the Company’s premium moissanite gemstone brand, for sale in the worldwide fine jewelry market. The Company also markets and distributes
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds and finished jewelry featuring lab grown diamonds for sale in the worldwide fine jewelry market. Moissanite, also known by its chemical name silicon carbide (“SiC”), is a rare mineral first
discovered in a meteorite crater. Because naturally occurring SiC crystals are too small for commercial use, larger crystals must be grown in a laboratory. Lab grown diamonds are also grown using technology that replicates the natural diamond
growing process. The only differentiation between that of a lab grown diamond and a mined diamond is its origin. The result is a man-made diamond that is chemically, physically, and optically the same as those grown beneath the earth’s surface.
The Company sells loose moissanite jewels, loose lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry featuring both moissanite and lab grown diamonds at wholesale prices to distributors,
manufacturers, retailers, and designers, including some of the largest distributors and jewelry manufacturers in the world. The Company’s finished jewelry and loose moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds that are mounted into fine jewelry by
other manufacturers are sold at retail outlets and via the Internet. The Company sells at retail prices to end-consumers through its own
Charles & Colvard
Signature Showroom , which opened in October 2022, and also through its wholly owned operating subsidiary, charlesandcolvard.com, LLC, third-party online marketplaces, drop-ship, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce outlets. The
Company also sells at discount retail prices to end-consumers through moissaniteoutlet.com, LLC, a wholly owned operating subsidiary of charlesandcolvard.com, LLC, and third-party online marketplaces.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
–
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. However, certain
information or footnote disclosures normally included in complete financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed, or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the results for
the interim periods presented. The results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
The condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
are unaudited. The balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 is derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The accompanying statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes contained in
Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2022 Annual Report”) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 2, 2022.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and as of the fiscal year ended June
30, 2022, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries charlesandcolvard.com, LLC, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, moissaniteoulet.com, LLC, which was formed and incorporated as of February 24, 2022; Charles &
Colvard Direct, LLC; and Charles & Colvard (HK) Ltd., the Company’s Hong Kong subsidiary, which was entered into dormancy as of September 30, 2020 following its re-activation in December 2017. Charles & Colvard (HK) Ltd. previously became
dormant in the second quarter of 2009 and has had no operating activity since 2008. Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC, had no operating activity during the six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. All intercompany accounts have been
eliminated.
Significant Accounting Policies
–
In the opinion of the
Company’s management, the Company’s significant accounting policies used for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are consistent with those used for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Accordingly, please refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Annual Report for the Company’s significant accounting policies.

Table of Contents
Use of Estimates
– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. As
future events and their effects, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses, cannot be fully determined with precision, actual results of operations, cash flow, and financial position could differ significantly from
estimates. The most significant estimates impacting the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements relate to valuation and classification of inventories, accounts receivable reserves, deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, and
revenue recognition. Changes in estimates are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents –
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date
of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash –
In accordance with the terms of the Company’s cash collateralized $ 5.00
million credit facility from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan Chase”), which expires by its terms on July 31, 2023, the Company is required
to keep $ 5.05
million in a cash deposit account held by JPMorgan Chase. Such amount is held as security for the Company’s credit
facility from JPMorgan Chase. Accordingly, this cash deposit held by JPMorgan Chase is classified as restricted cash for financial reporting purposes on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. For additional information regarding
the Company’s cash collateralized credit facility, see Note 10, “Debt.”
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company’s broker-dealer agreement with Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (“Oppenheimer”), with whom the Company has engaged to transact common
stock share repurchases in connection with its stock repurchase program, the Company is required to maintain a funded liquid margin account held by Oppenheimer for the benefit of the Company. The purpose of this account is to fund the Company’s
common stock purchases and any underlying transaction costs and fees. Depending upon the level and timing of stock repurchase activity, the funded margin account cash balance will fluctuate from time to time. At December 31, 2022 and June 30,
2022, cash in the amount of approximately $ 30
and approximately $ 461 ,000, respectively, was held by Oppenheimer. Such cash amount held by Oppenheimer was classified as restricted cash for financial reporting purposes on the Company’s
condensed consolidated balance sheets. For additional information regarding the Company’s stock repurchase program, see Note 11, “Shareholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation.”
The reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consist of the following as of the dates
presented:
December 31,
2022
June 30,
2022

Reclassification
–
Certain
amounts in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly
period ended December 31, 2022 have been reclassified to conform to current presentation, principally amounts presented in Note 7, “Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities”, relating to the combination of accrued sales taxes and accrued
franchise taxes, which had previously been presented separately. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial position or condensed consolidated results of operations as of or for the three and six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and as of the year ended June 30, 2022.
Recently Adopted/Issued Accounting Pronouncements
–
In March 2020, and as updated
in January 2021, in response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (“IBORs”), and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB ”)
issued
Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU ”)
2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)
(“ASU 2020-04”), which provides guidance to ease the burden in accounting for or recognizing
the effects of referenced interest rate reform on financial reporting. ASU 2020-04 is elective and may be applied as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. As described in more detail in Note 10, “Debt”, borrowings under the Company’s line
of credit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 would have been based on a rate equal to the

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making operating decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s operating and reportable segments.
The Company manages its business through
two
operating and reportable
segments based on its distribution channels to sell its product lines, loose jewels and finished jewelry: its “Online Channels” segment, which consists of e-commerce outlets including charlesandcolvard.com, moissaniteoutlet.com, third-party
online marketplaces, drop-ship retail, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce outlets; and its “Traditional” segment, which consists of wholesale and retail customers , including
its own
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom . The accounting policies of the Online Channels segment and Traditional segment are the same as
those described in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Annual Report.
The Company evaluates the financial performance of its segments based on net sales; product line gross profit, or the excess of product line sales over product line cost of goods sold;
and operating income. The Company’s product line cost of goods sold is defined as product cost of goods sold, excluding non-capitalized expenses from the Company’s manufacturing and production control departments, comprising personnel costs,
depreciation, leases, utilities, and corporate overhead allocations; freight out; inventory write-downs; and other inventory adjustments, comprising costs of quality issues, and damaged goods.
The Company allocates certain general and administrative expenses between its Online Channels segment and its Traditional segment based on net sales and number of employees to arrive at
segment operating income. Unallocated expenses remain in its Traditional segment.
Summary financial information by reportable segment is as follows:

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. U.S. GAAP also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when
available. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value
hierarchy consists of three levels based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:
Level 1.
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
Level 2.
Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3.
Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The Company evaluates assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each
reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made by management of the Company. The financial instruments identified as subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis are cash and cash equivalents, notes
receivable, trade accounts receivable, and trade accounts payable. All financial instruments are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the nature of these financial
instruments. Assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include property and equipment, leasehold improvements, and intangible assets comprising patents, license rights, and trademarks. These items are recognized at fair
value when they are considered to be impaired.  For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no
impairment was
recorded.

The Company’s work-in-process inventories include raw SiC crystals on which processing costs, such as labor and sawing, have been incurred; and components, such as metal castings and
finished goods set with moissanite jewels, that have been issued to jobs in the manufacture of finished jewelry. The Company’s moissanite jewel manufacturing process involves the production of intermediary shapes, called “preforms,” that vary
depending upon the expected size and shape of the finished jewel. To maximize manufacturing efficiencies, preforms may be made in advance of current finished inventory needs but remain in work-in-process inventories. As of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, work-in-process inventories issued to active production jobs approximated $ 1.37
million and $ 2.76
million, respectively.

The Company’s moissanite and lab grown diamond jewels do not degrade in quality over time and inventory generally consists of the shapes and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry
industry. In addition, approximately
one-half
of the Company’s jewel inventory is not mounted in finished jewelry settings and is
therefore not subject to fashion trends. Product obsolescence is closely monitored and reviewed by management as of and for each financial reporting period.
The Company manufactures finished jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds. Relative to loose moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds, finished jewelry is more
fashion-oriented and subject to styling trends that could render certain designs obsolete over time. The majority of the Company’s finished jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds is held in inventory for resale and largely consists
of such core designs as stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets that tend not to be subject to significant obsolescence risk due to their classic styling. In addition, the Company generally holds smaller quantities
of designer-inspired and trend moissanite fashion jewelry that is available for resale through retail companies and through its Online Channels segment. The Company also carries a limited amount of inventory as part of its sample line that the
Company uses in the selling process to its customers.
The Company’s continuing operating subsidiaries carry no net inventories, and inventory is transferred without intercompany markup from the parent entity as product line cost of goods
sold when sold to the end consumer.
The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an average cost basis. Each accounting period the Company
evaluates the valuation and classification of inventories including the need for potential adjustments to inventory-related reserves, which include significant estimates by management, including the effect of market factors and sales trends.
Changes
to the Company’s inventory reserves and allowances are accounted for in the accounting period in which a change in such reserves and allowances is observed and deemed appropriate, including changes in management’s estimates used in the process to
determine such reserves and valuation allowances .

NOTE RECEIVABLE
On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a $ 250,000
convertible promissory note agreement (the “Convertible Promissory Note”), with an unrelated third-party strategic marketing partner. The Convertible Promissory Note is unsecured and was scheduled originally to mature on March 5, 2022. In
February 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Convertible Promissory Note that was effective as of December 9, 2021 and changed the maturity date to September 30, 2022. Effective September 26, 2022, the Company further amended the
Convertible Promissory Note (the “September 2022 Amendment”) and changed the maturity date to June 20, 2024 (the “Maturity Date”). Prior to the September 2022 Amendment, the Company accounted for the Convertible Promissory Note as a current note
receivable within the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. However, in accordance with the terms of the September 2022 Amendment, the note receivable is classified as a noncurrent note receivable within the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
Interest
is accrued at a simple rate of
0.14 %
per annum and will continue to accrue until the Convertible Promissory Note is converted in accordance with the conversion privileges contained within the Convertible Promissory Note or is repaid.
Principal outstanding during an event of
default accrues interest at the rate of
5 % per annum. Prior to the September 2022 Amendment, accrued and unpaid interest on the
Convertible Promissory Note was classified as a current asset and included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the terms of the September 2022 Amendment, accrued
and unpaid interest on the Convertible Promissory Note is classified as a noncurrent asset and included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
Subject to the borrower’s completion of a specified equity financing transaction (an “Equity Financing”) on or prior to the Maturity Date, the unpaid principal amount, including accrued
and unpaid interest, automatically converts into equity units of the most senior class of equity securities issued to investors in the Equity Financing at the lesser of
80 % of the per unit price of the units purchased by investors or the price equal to $ 33,500,000
divided by the aggregate number of outstanding units of the borrower immediately prior to the closing of the financing. Unless converted as provided in the Convertible Promissory Note, the principal amount, including accrued and unpaid interest,
will, on the Maturity Date, at the Company’s option either ( i ) become due and payable to the Company, or ( ii ) convert into equity units at the specified conversion
price in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Promissory Note.

INCOME TAXES
For both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s average effective tax rate was
20.46 % which consisted of the federal income tax rate of
21.00 % and
a blended state income tax rate benefit of
0.54 %, net of the federal benefit. For both the three and six months ended December
31, 2021, the Company’s statutory tax rate was
22.24 % which consisted of the federal income tax rate of
21 % and a blended state income tax rate of
1.24 %,
net of the federal benefit. The Company’s effective income tax rate reflects the effect of federal and state income taxes on earnings and the impact of differences in book and tax accounting arising primarily from the permanent tax benefits
associated with stock-based compensation transactions during the quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s effective tax rate was
18.37 % and
16.92 %, respectively.
The Company recognized a net income tax benefit of approximately $ 132 ,000
and $ 435 ,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared with a net income tax expense of
approximately $ 283 ,000 and $ 406 ,000
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
As of each reporting date, management
considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact the Company’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, management determined that the Company’s expectations of future taxable
income in upcoming tax years, including estimated growth rates applied to future expected taxable income that includes significant management estimates and assumptions, would continue to be sufficient to result in full utilization of the
Company’s remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain of the deferred tax assets prior to any statutory expiration. As a result, management determined that sufficient positive evidence existed as of December 31, 2022, to
conclude that it is more likely than not deferred tax assets of approximately $ 6.29
million remain realizable. Conversely, management
further determined that sufficient negative evidence continued to exist to conclude it was uncertain that the Company would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize certain of its deferred tax assets. Therefore, management continued to
maintain a valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets relating to certain state net operating loss carryforwards from its e-commerce subsidiary due to the timing uncertainty of when it will generate positive taxable income to
utilize the associated deferred tax assets. In addition, a valuation allowance remains against certain deferred tax assets relating to operating loss carryforwards relating to the Company’s dormant subsidiary located in Hong Kong.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease Arrangements
On December 9, 2013, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement, as amended on December 23, 2013,
April 15, 2014, and January 29, 2021 (the “Lease Agreement”), for its corporate headquarters, which occupies approximately
36,350
square feet of office, storage and light manufacturing space and is classified as an operating lease for financial reporting purposes. The expiration date of the base term of the Lease Agreement is October 31, 2026 and the terms of the Lease
Agreement contain no early termination provisions. Provided there is no outstanding uncured event of default under the Lease Agreement, the Company has an option to extend the lease term for a period of
five years . The Company’s option to extend the term of the Lease Agreement must be exercised in writing on or before
270
days prior to expiration of the then-current term. If the option is exercised, the monthly minimum rent for each of the extended terms will be adjusted to the then
prevailing fair market rate.
The Company took possession of the leased property on May 23, 2014, once certain improvements to the
leased space were completed and did not have access to the property before this date. Upon execution of the third amendment to the Lease Agreement (the “Lease Amendment”) on January 29, 2021, the Lease Amendment included a rent abatement in the
amount of approximately $ 214 ,000, which is reflected in the rent payments used in the calculation of the right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and
lease liability once remeasured upon the execution of the Lease Amendment to extend the lease term. The Lease Amendment also included an allowance for leasehold improvements offered by the landlord in an amount not to exceed approximately $ 545 ,000. As of the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company has been reimbursed approximately $ 506,000
by the landlord for qualified leasehold improvements in accordance with the terms of the Lease Amendment. This reimbursement by the landlord reduced the remaining ROU
asset by the same amount and is being recognized prospectively over the remaining term of the lease.
The Company has no other material operating leases and is not party to leases that would qualify for
classification as a finance lease, variable lease, or short-term lease.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s balance sheet classifications of its leases are as follows:
Operating Leases:
Noncurrent operating lease ROU assets

The Company’s total operating lease cost was approximately $ 175 ,000 and $ 214 ,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Company’s total operating lease cost was approximately $ 349 ,000 and $ 413 ,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate used and assumed discount
rate with respect to operating leases was
2.81 % and the remaining operating lease term was
3.83
years.

On December 12, 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”)
with Wolfspeed, Inc. (“Wolfspeed”). Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company agreed to exclusively purchase from Wolfspeed, and Wolfspeed agreed to exclusively supply,
100 % of the Company’s required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the
Supply Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 24, 2018, unless extended by the parties.
Effective June 22, 2018, the Supply Agreement was amended to extend the expiration date to June 25,
2023. The Supply Agreement was also amended to (i) provide the Company with
one
option, subject to certain conditions, to unilaterally
extend the term of the Supply Agreement for an additional
two-year
period following expiration of the initial term; (ii) establish a
process by which Wolfspeed may begin producing alternate SiC material based on the Company’s specifications that will give the Company the flexibility to use the materials in a broader variety of its products; and (iii) permit the Company to
purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions.
Effective June 30, 2020, the Supply Agreement was further amended to extend the expiration date to
June 29, 2025, which may be extended again by mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply Agreement was also amended to, among other things, (i) spread the Company’s total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement in the amount of
approximately $ 52.95
million over the term of the Supply Agreement, as amended; (ii) establish a process by which Wolfspeed has agreed
to accept purchase orders in excess of the agreed-upon minimum purchase commitment, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) permit the Company to purchase revised amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions.
The Company’s total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, as amended, until June 2025 is
approximately $ 52.95
million, of which approximately $ 24.75
million remains to be purchased as of December 31, 2022. Over the life of the Supply Agreement, as amended, the Company’s future minimum annual purchase commitments of SiC crystals range from approximately
$ 4.00
million to $ 10.00
million each year.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased approximately $ 1.80
million and $ 3.00
million,
respectively, of SiC crystals from Wolfspeed pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended.

Inflation
Heightened levels of inflation and the potential
worsening of macro-economic conditions present a risk for the Company, its suppliers, and the stability of the broader retail and e-commerce industry. During the first six months of the
Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”), the Company has experienced impacts to its labor and overhead rates and suppliers have signaled inflation related cost pressures, which is expected to flow through to the Company’s
costs and pricing. While the Company has seen some impact from inflation on its financial results in the first six months of Fiscal 2023, if inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and the Company is unable
to successfully mitigate the impact, the Company’s costs are likely to continue to increase, resulting in further pressure on its revenues, margins, and cash flows. In addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising
interest rates could constrain the overall purchasing power of the Company’s customers for its products and services, in particular in the near term to the extent inflation assumptions are less than current inflationary pressures.

DEBT
Line of Credit
Effective July 7, 2021, the Company obtained from JPMorgan Chase a $ 5.00
million cash collateralized line of credit facility (the “JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility”). The JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility may be used
for general corporate and working capital purposes, including permitted acquisitions and certain additional indebtedness for borrowed money, installment obligations, and obligations under capital and operating leases. The JPMorgan Chase
Credit Facility is secured by a cash deposit in the amount of $ 5.05
million held by JPMorgan Chase as collateral for the line of
credit facility and was scheduled to mature on July 31, 2022. Effective July 28, 2022, the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date to July 31, 2023, and append the Company’s obligations
under the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility to be guaranteed by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC, charlesandcolvard.com, LLC, and moissaniteoutlet.com, LLC .
Each advance under the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility, as amended, accrues interest at a rate equal
to the sum of JPMorgan Chase’s monthly secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR rate”) to which JPMorgan Chase is subject with respect to the adjusted SOFR rate as established by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, plus a margin of
1.25 % per annum and an unsecured to secured interest rate adjustment of
0.10 % per annum. Prior to its amendment, each advance under the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility would have accrued interest at a rate equal to JPMorgan Chase’s monthly LIBOR rate
multiplied by a statutory reserve rate for eurocurrency funding to which JPMorgan Chase is subject with respect to the adjusted LIBOR rate as established by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, plus a margin of
1.25 % per annum. Interest is calculated monthly on an actual/360-day basis and payable monthly in arrears. Principal outstanding during an event
of default, at JPMorgan Chase’s option, accrues interest at a rate of
3 % per annum in excess of the above rate. Any advance may
be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty at any time .
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
no t borrowed against the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility and had
no
outstanding debt as of the period then ended .

NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income per
common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods. Common equivalent shares consist of stock options and unvested restricted shares that are computed using
the treasury stock method. Anti-dilutive stock awards consist of stock options that would have been anti-dilutive in the application of the treasury stock method.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit and cash equivalents held with banks and trade accounts receivable. The Company places cash deposits with federally
insured financial institutions and maintains its cash at banks and financial institutions it considers to be of high credit quality. However, the Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s
insurable limits. Accordingly, balances in excess of federally insured limitations may not be insured. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts, and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant risks
on such accounts.
Trade receivables potentially subject the Company to credit risk. Payment terms on trade receivables for the Company’s Traditional segment customers are generally between
30
and
90 days , though it may offer
extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. The Company extends credit to its customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and credit history that
is verified through trade association reference services, the customer’s payment history with the Company, the customer’s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the Company’s opportunity to introduce its moissanite jewels or finished
jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds to new or expanded markets. Collateral is not generally required from customers. The need for an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of
specific customers, historical trends, and other information. For additional information regarding the Company’s measurement and disclosure of credit losses on financial assets, including trade accounts receivable, see Note 4, “Fair Value
Measurements.”
At times, a portion of the Company’s accounts receivable will be due from customers that have individual balances of 10% or more of the Company’s total gross accounts receivable.
The following is a summary of customers that represent 10% or more of total gross accounts receivable as of the dates presented:

Overview
Our Mission
At Charles & Colvard, Ltd., our mission is to provide a more conscious and conflict-free fine jewelry experience for our customers. We are dedicated to blazing a more brilliant path forward with our
Made,
Not Mined ™
gemstones and committed to creating fine jewelry with a conscience.
About Charles & Colvard
Charles & Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles & Colvard, we, us, or our) is a globally recognized fine jewelry company specializing in lab created gemstones. We manufacture,
market, and distribute
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite ®
(which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and
in September 2020, we announced our expansion into the lab grown diamond market with the launch of
Caydia ® , an exclusive
brand of premium lab grown diamonds. We offer gemstones and finished jewelry featuring our proprietary moissanite jewels and premium lab grown diamonds for sale in the worldwide fine jewelry market. Charles & Colvard is the original source of
created moissanite, and in 2015, we debuted
Forever One ™ , our premium moissanite gemstone brand. As an e-commerce and
multi-channel destination for fine jewelry featuring lab grown gemstones, we believe that the addition of lab grown diamonds is a natural progression for the Charles & Colvard brand.
We sell loose moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry set with these gems through two operating segments: our Online Channels segment, which encompasses our digital properties components, comprised of our
charlesandcolvard.com and moissaniteoutlet.com websites, e-commerce outlets, including marketplaces, drop-ship customers, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce customers; and our Traditional segment, which consists of domestic and
international distributors and retail customers, including end-consumers through our first
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom , which opened in October 2022. We report segment information based on the
“management” approach. This segment reporting approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our operating and reportable segments.

Table of Contents
We operate in an e-commerce environment characterized by both complexity in global markets and ongoing economic uncertainties in the U.S. and internationally.
Our strategy is to build a globally revered and
accessible brand of gemstones and finished fine jewelry products set with moissanite and lab grown diamonds. We believe that our goods appeal to a wide consumer audience and leverage our advantage of being the original and leading worldwide source
of moissanite and purveyor of premium lab grown diamonds. We believe a direct relationship with consumers is an important component to this strategy, which entails delivering tailored educational content, engaging in interactive dialogue with our
audience, and positioning our brand to meet the demands of today’s discerning consumer.
A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on our core products, improving the quality and
predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing those products quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Moreover, recognizing today that our customers and vendors are resource
constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio of products in a disciplined manner with a focus on domestic markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our global marketplace sales. We continue to focus on
affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue innovating and investing in lab created gemstone technologies to fulfill evolving product requirements for our customers and investing in our people so that we have the technical and
production skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to build sound financial returns to our investors.
We believe our expanding application of an omni-channel sales strategy across the fine jewelry trade and to the end consumer with accessible gemstones and value branded finished jewelry featuring
Charles &
Colvard Created Moissanite ®
and
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds positions our products at the many touchpoints where consumers are when they are making their buying decisions – thereby continuing to create greater exposure for our brand and increasing consumer demand.
Fiscal 2023 Financial Outlook
Our strategic goals for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, or Fiscal 2023, are centered on continuing to expand Charles & Colvard’s brand on a global scale and to increase the size of our business through top-line growth. As lab-created
gemstones are being embraced by emerging generations, we believe our ability to establish moissanite and our lab grown diamonds along with the Charles & Colvard brand directly with conscious consumers is key to our future success and ability to
fuel our growth. We plan to continue executing on our key Fiscal 2023 strategies with an ongoing commitment to spending judiciously and generating sustainable earnings improvement.
As we disclosed last quarter, in October 2022, we officially opened the first
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom
located in our corporate headquarters in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park.
The opening of this new showroom provided local consumers in the Raleigh metropolitan area the ability to shop in person for our collections of fine luxury jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds in time for the calendar year-end
holiday season. During our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, we took several steps to broaden available selections of finished jewelry, which features our exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds, with an expanded
Couture Collection
assortment of finished jewelry that showcases a combination of mixed cuts of our
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds and recycled precious metals featuring new designs of rings, earrings, and pendant styles that we believe is the future of
Made, Not Mined ™ fine jewelry. We
believe this collection showcases a combination of mixed cut gemstones in single designs to create consumer interest. Also, during the second fiscal quarter, we expanded our
Ouro Edition
of fine jewelry to
include
Caydia ®
lab grown diamond fashion pieces. The
Ouro Edition
is our curation
of polished recycled 14 karat gold jewelry pieces with a design focus on geometric shapes. We believe that
Ouro –
which is Portuguese for gold – will bring a fresh approach to our finished jewelry in
modern dimensional styles in yellow gold to bring our fine luxury jewelry to the forefront of modern fashion. In addition, with the launch of our latest lab grown precious gemstones in color, which we announced last October, we are now offering a
colorful new dimension of our
Made, Not Mined ™ fine jewelry repertoire featuring lab grown ruby, sapphire, and emerald gemstones. We further offered an expanded assortment of
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds to include higher total carat weight items adding finished jewelry featuring lab grown diamonds with total carat weights
of up to and in some cases exceeding 4.0 carats. Previously, we focused primarily on smaller total carat weight items of finished jewelry featuring our
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds. Lastly, in December 2022, we expanded our bridal and engagement fine jewelry collections of styles featuring
Forever One™
moissanite to
continue to showcase and promote finished jewelry featuring our core product gemstone.
In early December 2022, we hosted a multiple-day private press event in New York City that included interviews with editors of numerous fashion and jewelry print and electronic media publications to showcase and promote our brand of fine
jewelry. Throughout the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, our finished jewelry products were featured in multiple national and local print and electronic media publications, such as
InStyle ,
HuffPost ,
Forbes ,
AC Magazine ,
The Knot ® ,
National Jeweler , WRAL, and the
Triangle Business Journal . During the quarter, we also launched local print media
public relations campaigns in
Midtown Magazine
and
Raleigh Magazine
to promote the opening of our
Charles & Colvard Signature
Showroom . Also in December, the popularity of our
Made, Not Mined ™
Caydia ®
lab grown diamonds was the subject of a proprietary news feature broadcast on
Spectrum News Channel 1 , which is a primary cable news channel network that is broadcast statewide throughout North Carolina.
Lastly, and in conjunction with our community outreach programs, during the December year-end holiday season, we sponsored the
29th Annual Jingle Ball
at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science, which
is hosted by Capital City Clauses, Inc., a federally registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation whose mission is to enrich children’s lives in the Raleigh metropolitan area by providing toy gifting and basic needs to those who are underprivileged
and in need during the Christmas holidays and beyond.

As evidenced by our results for the first six months of Fiscal 2023, domestic and global inflation and rising interest rates, coupled with ongoing fears of recession, continue to erode consumer confidence and present major challenges for the
global retail and e-commerce industry. While American consumers spent more this holiday season to keep up with higher prices, consumer shopping lulls we experienced during the non-peak holiday weeks during the calendar year-end holiday season were
deeper than we anticipated and we expect that consumers will continue to feel pressured financially, particularly during the first half of calendar year 2023. We are facing similar challenges to other retailers, including those in the e-commerce
space, but particularly those in the luxury retail arena. At the same time, however, we believe these challenges are providing us the opportunity to continue reevaluating technologies and strategies that can help position us in
a potentially more profitable position. We plan to continue to invest in our business and view current challenges as opportunities to help accelerate our growth trajectory and return to profitability .
Inflation
Heightened levels of inflation and the potential
worsening of macro-economic conditions present a risk for us, our suppliers, and the stability of the broader retail and
e-commerce industry. During the first six months of Fiscal 2023, we have experienced impacts to our labor and overhead rates and suppliers have signaled inflation related cost pressures, which will flow through to our costs and pricing. While we
have seen some impact from inflation on our financial results in the first six months of Fiscal 2023, if inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs
are likely to continue to increase, resulting in further pressure on our revenues, margins, and cash flows. In addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rates could constrain the overall purchasing power
of our customers for our products and services, in particular in the near term to the extent inflation assumptions are less than current inflationary pressures. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our
operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases and the adverse effects from inflation.
We discuss our strategic outlook, key strategies, and general economic and market conditions for Fiscal 2023 in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”, contained in our 2022 Annual Report.
COVID-19
The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including management’s ability to execute its strategic initiatives in the expected timeframes, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic
related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, any potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 and its variant viral infections, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, and related government actions to
prevent and manage disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot at this time predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue to impact our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in Fiscal 2023 .
For additional risks to the Company related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors”, contained in our 2022 Annual Report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which we prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. “Critical accounting policies and estimates” are defined as those most important to the financial statement presentation and that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Under different assumptions and/or conditions, those actual results of operations may materially differ. The most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation and classification of
inventories, accounts receivable reserves, deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, and revenue recognition. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, but these policies typically do not require us to make
estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

We have disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in our 2022 Annual Report, and that disclosure should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no significant changes in our critical
accounting policies and estimates during the first six months of Fiscal 2023.

Consolidated net sales were $10.37 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $13.75 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $3.39 million, or 25%.
Consolidated net sales were $17.74 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $24.03 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $6.29 million, or 26%. We had lower net sales in both operating
business segments during the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022. Overall consumer confidence has continued to show signs of weakening due to general economic uncertainties, coupled with domestic and worldwide inflation, including
recessionary fears, and rising interest rates. Notwithstanding the year-end 2022 holiday shopping season, these conditions have brought about lower consumer demand for our finished jewelry products, which resulted in lower net sales in our Online
Channels segment during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. These same general economic conditions also caused weakness in demand for moissanite jewels from our domestic distributors, which in turn resulted in lower loose jewel
product net sales during the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 in our Traditional segment.
24
Table of Contents
Sales of finished jewelry represented 81% and 79% of total consolidated net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 77% and 68%, respectively, of total consolidated net sales for the corresponding
periods of the prior year. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, finished jewelry sales were $8.44 million compared to $10.54 million for the corresponding period of the prior year, a decrease of approximately $2.10 million, or 20%. For the
six months ended December 31, 2022, finished jewelry sales were $13.98 million compared to $16.23 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, a decrease of approximately $2.25 million, or 14%. These decreases in finished jewelry
sales for the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 were due to lower demand across all of our finished jewelry products as a result of adverse global and domestic general economic conditions.
Sales of loose jewels represented 19% and 21% of total consolidated net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 23% and 32%, respectively, of total consolidated net sales for the corresponding
periods of the prior fiscal year. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, loose jewel sales were $1.93 million compared to $3.21 million for the corresponding period of the prior year, a decrease of $1.28 million, or 40%. For the six months
ended December 31, 2022, loose jewel sales were $3.77 million compared to $7.81 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $4.04 million, or 52%. The decrease in loose jewel sales for the three- and six-month
periods ended December 31, 2022 was principally due to lower sales of loose jewels through our distribution network in our Online Channels segment and Traditional segment, as a result of global and domestic general adverse macroeconomic conditions.
U.S. net sales accounted for approximately 96% of total consolidated net sales for each of the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022, compared to 95% of total consolidated net sales for each of the corresponding periods of the
prior year. U.S. net sales decreased to $9.99 million, or 23%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. U.S. net sales decreased to $17.09 million, or 25%, during the six months ended
December 31, 2022 from the corresponding period of the prior year. U.S. net sales decreased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of decreased sales to U.S. customers in both our Online Channels segment and
Traditional segment for the same reasons outlined above.
Our largest U.S. customer during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 accounted for 12% and 14% of total consolidated net sales during each respective period. This same customer was also our largest U.S. customer during the three and
six months ended December 31, 2021 when this customer accounted for 16% and 15% of total consolidated net sales during each of the respective three- and six-month periods. Our second largest U.S. customer during the six months ended December 31,
2021, accounted for 11% of total consolidated net sales during the period then ended. Other than our U.S. customers noted above during the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no other customers with sales that
represented 10% or more of total consolidated net sales for the periods then ended. We expect that we, along with our customers, will remain dependent on our ability to maintain and enhance our customer-related programs. A change in or loss of any
of these customer or retailer relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
International net sales accounted for approximately 4% of total consolidated net sales for each of the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 5% of total consolidated net sales for each of the
corresponding periods of the prior year. International net sales decreased 49% and 45% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, from the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year due to lower demand in our
international distributor market due to shutdowns in the Asia Pacific region during the current period, coupled with the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. In light of the effects of ongoing global economic conditions, we
continue to evaluate these and other potential distributors in international markets to determine the best long-term partners. As a result, and in light of the impact from the ongoing worldwide pandemic and international trade challenges, we expect
that our sales in these markets may fluctuate significantly each reporting period.
We did not have an international customer account for 10% or more of total consolidated sales during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. A portion of our international consolidated sales represents jewels sold
internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers.

Total cost of goods sold was $6.07 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $7.03 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a net decrease of approximately $962,000, or 14%. Total cost of goods sold was $10.16
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $12.05 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, a net decrease of approximately $1.89 million, or 16%. Product line cost of goods sold is defined as product cost of goods
sold in each of our Online Channels segment and Traditional segment excluding non-capitalized expenses from our manufacturing and production control departments, comprising personnel costs, depreciation, rent, utilities, and corporate overhead
allocations; freight out; inventory write-offs; and other inventory adjustments, comprising costs of quality issues, and damaged goods.
The decrease in total cost of goods sold for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily driven by decreased sales of finished jewelry and loose jewels during the three months ended December 31,
2022 in both our Online Channels segment and Traditional segment. We experienced lower demand in our Online Channels segment as a result of lower finished jewelry product demand during the quarter despite the calendar year-end 2022 holiday season
where we saw consumer shopping lulls during the non-peak holiday shopping weeks that were deeper than we expected. Likewise, we experienced lower loose jewel product demand in our Traditional segment throughout the quarter.
The net increase in non-product line cost of goods sold for the three months ended December 31, 2022, comprises an approximate $270,000 increase in non-capitalized manufacturing production control expenses principally related to the timing of
when work-in-process goods are received into inventory and overhead costs are allocated. This increase was partially offset by an approximate $107,000 decrease in freight out principally from decreased shipping volume during the three-month period
and a $44,000 decrease in other inventory adjustments principally related to changes in production standard cost variances compared to those in the first three months of Fiscal 2022.
The decrease in total cost of goods sold for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was also primarily driven by the decreased sales of finished goods and loose jewels during the six-months ended December 31,
2022 in both of our Online Channels segment and Traditional segment. We experienced lower demand in our Online Channels segment as a result of lower finished jewelry product demand during the six-month-period despite the calendar year-end 2022
holiday season and likewise saw lower loose jewel product demand in our Traditional segment throughout the six-month period.
The net increase in non-product line cost of goods sold for the six months ended December 31, 2022, comprises an approximate $305,000 increase in non-capitalized manufacturing production control expenses principally related to the timing of when
work-in-process goods are received into inventory and overhead costs are allocated and an approximate $8,000 increase in other inventory adjustments principally related to changes in production standard cost variances compared to those in the first
six months of Fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by an approximate $113,000 decrease in inventory write-offs in the first six months of the Fiscal 2022, compared to those in the comparable prior year period, and an approximate
$48,000 decrease in freight out principally from decreased shipping volume during the six-month period.

The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to an $85,000 increase in compensation expenses; an $81,000 increase in general business taxes; a
$31,000 increase in software-related costs incurred primarily in connection with new software-related agreements associated with upgraded sales-related operating systems; a $26,000 increase in bank fees expenses, which are principally related to
higher credit card transaction and payment platform fees; a $24,000 increase in professional services principally comprising consulting services for marketing support in the current year period; an $8,000 increase in telephone-related

The net decrease in advertising and digital marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $172,000 decrease in cooperative advertising in connection with lower sales
from a retail customer with whom we have a cooperative advertising arrangement that is based on sales volume; a $29,000 decrease in brand awareness marketing campaign expenditures in the current year period; and an $11,000 decrease in print media
expenses. These decreases were offset partially by a $178,000 increase in digital advertising spend and a $19,000 increase in outside agency fees.
Compensation expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 increased primarily due to a $121,000 increase in salaries, commissions, and related employee benefits in the aggregate. This increase was
partially offset by a $31,000 decrease in bonus expense and a $5,000 decrease in employee stock-based compensation expense.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $165,000 increase in compensation expenses; a $147,000 increase in advertising and digital
marketing expenses; a $118,000 increase in general business taxes; an $81,000 increase in professional services principally comprising consulting services for marketing support in the current year period; a $66,000 increase in bank fees expenses,
which are principally related to higher credit card transaction and payment platform fees; a $28,000 increase in software-related costs incurred primarily in connection with new software-related agreements associated with upgraded sales-related
operating systems; a $15,000 increase in charitable contributions; a $9,000 increase in telephone-related communications expenses; a $7,000 increase in employee-related recruiting and search fees for new hires; and a $7,000 increase in depreciation
and amortization expense principally related to new sales-related systems hardware and software. These increases were offset partially by a $3,000 decrease in travel expenses and a $2,000 net decrease in general office-related expenses.
Compensation expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 increased primarily as a result of a $198,000 increase in salaries, commissions, and related employee benefits in the aggregate. This increase
was partially offset by a $21,000 decrease in employee stock-based compensation expense and a $12,000 decrease in bonus expense.

marketing campaign expenditures in the current year period; and a $40,000 increase in outside agency fees. These increases were offset partially by a $127,000 decrease in expenses relating to our participation in the 2021 JCK Trade Show held in the

General and administrative expenses were $1.19 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.19 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $2,000, or less than 1%. General and
administrative expenses were $2.60 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2.77 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $172,000, or 6%.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $55,000 decrease in bank fees resulting from the revised fee structure associated with
different banking arrangements in place in the current period versus those in the year ago quarter; a $35,000 decrease in general business taxes and licenses; a $25,000 decrease in compensation expenses; a $22,000 decrease in employee-related
recruiting and search fees for new hires; a $20,000 decrease in bad debt expense associated with our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy; and a $6,000 net decrease in miscellaneous other general and administrative expenses. These
decreases were partially offset by a $55,000 increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to general office leasehold improvements associated with the lease on our corporate headquarters and business expansion related to the opening of
our new
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom
also located in our headquarters campus; a $50,000 increase in travel and expense-related expenditures as we returned to more traditional business travel
patterns; a $30,000 increase in professional services; a $12,000 increase in insurance expense, principally related to increased premiums; a $9,000 increase in software-related costs; and a $5,000 increase in rent expense, primarily related to our
corporate headquarters operating lease.
The decrease in compensation expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $106,000 decrease in employee stock-based compensation expense; and a $14,000 decrease in bonus
expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $95,000 net increase in salaries and related employee benefits.
Professional services fees increased for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $20,000 increase in fees associated with audit and tax services; a $19,000 increase in legal fees associated
with corporate governance matters; and a $6,000 increase in broker commissions related to our stock repurchase program. These increases were partially offset by a $15,000 decrease in investor relations fees.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $249,000 decrease in compensation expenses; a $126,000 decrease in bank fees resulting from
the revised fee structure associated with different banking arrangements in place in the current period versus those in the year ago period; a $52,000 decrease in bad debt expense associated with our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy;
and a $24,000 decrease in employee-related recruiting and search fees for new hires. These decreases were partially offset by a $92,000 increase in general business taxes and licenses; a $69,000 increase in depreciation and amortization expense
related to general office leasehold improvements associated with the lease on our corporate headquarters and business expansion related to the opening of our new
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom
also located in our headquarters campus; a $65,000 increase in travel and expense related expenditures as we returned to more traditional business travel patterns; a $17,000 increase in software-related costs; a $16,000 increase in professional
services; a $15,000 increase in insurance expense, principally related to increased premiums; a $2,000 increase in rent expense, primarily related to our corporate headquarters operating lease; and a $3,000 net increase in miscellaneous other
general and administrative expenses.

Compensation expenses decreased for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 principally due to a $274,000 decrease in employee stock-based compensation expense; and a $168,000 decrease in bonus expense. These
decreases were partially offset by a $193,000 net increase in salaries and related employee benefits.
Professional services fees increased for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $25,000 increase in broker commissions primarily related to our stock repurchase program and a $19,000
increase in fees associated with audit and tax services. These increases were partially offset by a  $24,000 decrease in investor relations fees and a $4,000 decrease in legal fees associated with corporate governance matters.

Certain cash balances in excess of operating needs are deposited into and maintained in an interest-bearing account with a federally insured commercial bank. Accordingly, during the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we earned interest from cash on deposit in this interest-bearing account. The increase in earned interest for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 reflects movement of invested funds into a higher-yield money market fund in late Fiscal
2022, coupled with the overall increase in interest rates during the first six months of Fiscal 2023 compared with the same period in Fiscal 2022.
Loss on Foreign Currency Exchange
Losses on foreign currency exchange related to foreign sales transacted in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we had international sales transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar that resulted in foreign currency exchange net losses. There were no such international sales
transactions denominated in foreign currencies during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Provision for Income Taxes
For each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s average effective tax rate was 20.46% which consisted of the federal income tax rate of 21.00% and a blended state income tax rate benefit of 0.54%, net of the federal
benefit. For each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, our statutory tax rate was 22.24% which consisted of the federal income tax rate of 21% and a blended state income tax rate of 1.24%, net of the federal benefit. Our effective
income tax rate reflects the effect of federal and state income taxes on earnings and the impact of differences in book and tax accounting arising primarily from the permanent tax benefits associated with stock compensation transactions during the
quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our effective tax rate was 18.37% and 16.92%, respectively.

Table of Contents
We recognized a net income tax expense of approximately $132,000 and $435,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared with a net income tax expense of approximately $283,000 and $406,000 for the three and six
months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
As of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, we determined that our expectations of future taxable
income in upcoming tax years, including estimated growth rates applied to future expected taxable income that includes significant management estimates and assumptions, would continue to be sufficient to result in full utilization of our remaining
federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain of the deferred tax assets prior to any statutory expiration. As a result, we determined that sufficient positive evidence existed as of December 31, 2022, to conclude that it is more likely than
not deferred tax assets of approximately $6.29 million remain realizable. Conversely, we further determined that sufficient negative evidence continued to exist to conclude it was uncertain that we would have sufficient future taxable income to
utilize certain of our deferred tax assets. Therefore, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets relating to certain state net operating loss carryforwards from our e-commerce subsidiary due to the timing
uncertainty of when we will generate positive taxable income to utilize the associated deferred tax assets. In addition, a valuation allowance remains against certain deferred tax assets relating to operating loss carryforwards relating to our
dormant subsidiary located in Hong Kong.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our business depends on consumer demand for our products and could be adversely impacted by unfavorable general economic conditions, declines in consumer confidence and consumer disposable income, rising energy and fuel prices, increasing
freight costs, rising inflation rates, recession and fears of recession, consumer debt levels, increased interest rates, and higher tax rates. The full effect of these factors on the global and domestic economy remains uncertain. In addition, the
full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain as well at this time. Accordingly, w e remain increasingly focused
on the general macroeconomic conditions outlined herein as well
as on the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually evaluating their potential effect on our business and liquidity and capital resources.
Capital Structure and Long-Term Debt
Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Structure
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, provides that employers who received a Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan may also qualify for the Employee Retention Credit, or ERC. Previously, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, taxpayers that received a PPP loan were not eligible for the ERC and this change is retroactive to March 27, 2020. We believe that we may qualify for certain employer-related tax benefits pursuant to the ERC and
are currently working with an independent third-party tax credit firm to amend our applicable federal payroll tax returns for such benefit. Any benefit received in connection with available ERC credits will be recognized in the period such credits
are received.
Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Structure
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that allows us to periodically offer and sell, individually or in any combination, shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares
of common stock or preferred stock, and units consisting of any combination of the foregoing types of securities, up to a total of $25.00 million, of which all is available. However, we may offer and sell no more than one-third of our public float
(which is the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates) in any 12-month period. Our ability to issue equity securities under the shelf registration statement is subject to market conditions, which may be in
turn, subject to, among other things, the potential disruption and volatility that may be caused by ongoing macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any capital raise is not assured and may not be at terms that would be acceptable to us.

Table of Contents
In addition, on December
19, 2022, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we are not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules because the minimum
bid price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with further Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have 180 calendar days, or until June 19, 2023, to regain compliance
with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement. To regain compliance, any time before June 19, 2023, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. Under certain
circumstances, if we have not regained compliance at that time, we may be provided by Nasdaq with an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to regain compliance. While we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain
our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain such compliance during the applicable time periods set forth above. If we fail to continue to meet all applicable listing requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to
delist our common stock, the delisting could substantially decrease trading in our common stock, adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, and adversely affect our ability to raise capital under the shelf registration statement,
if at all .
Debt
We have no short- or long-term outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022.
Financing Activities
Long-Term Financing Activities
In accordance with authority granted by our Board of Directors on April 29, 2022, we can repurchase up to $5.00 million in shares outstanding of our common stock over the three-year period ending April 29, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the
repurchase authorization, the common stock share repurchases are generally at the discretion of management. As we repurchase our common shares, which have no par value, we report such shares held as treasury stock on our condensed consolidated
balance sheets, with the purchase price recorded within treasury stock.
During the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 358,116 shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $451,815 pursuant to the repurchase authorization. We repurchased no shares of our common stock during the
three-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Operating Activities and Cash Flows
We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $11.96 million, trade
accounts receivable of $2.09 million, and net current inventory of $13.09 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $15.67 million, trade accounts receivable of $2.22 million, and net current inventory of $11.02 million as of June 30,
2022. We also had access during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 to a $5.00 million cash collateralized line of credit facility, or the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility, that we obtained effective July 9, 2021, as amended July 28, 2022,
from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or JPMorgan Chase.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our working capital decreased by approximately $2.74 million to $26.32 million from $29.06 million at June 30, 2022. As described more fully below, the decrease in working capital at December 31,
2022 is primarily attributable to an increase in our accounts payable, a decrease in our accounts receivables, an increase in our short-term operating lease liabilities, the classification of the note receivable as noncurrent as of December 31,
2022 as compared to current as of June 30, 2022, and a net decrease in our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. These factors were offset partially by a decrease in our accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our allocation
of inventory from long-term to short-term due to a higher expected sell through of inventory on hand in the upcoming period, and an increase in our prepaid expenses and other assets. Our cash used for investing activities were principally for
construction-in-process expenditures related to our retail expansion program and the construction of our first
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom
and other leasehold improvements in our corporate
offices. Our cash used for financing activities was principally for our share repurchase program.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $3.05 million of cash was used by our operations. The primary drivers of our use of cash were a net loss in the amount of approximately $1.93 million; an increase in inventory of $1.60
million to build inventory in preparation for the calendar year-end holiday season; a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $529,000; and an increase in accounts receivable of $293,000. These factors were offset partially by an
increase in accounts payable of $460,000; a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $247,000; and the favorable impact of approximately $595,000 of non-cash expenses.
31
Table of Contents
Accounts receivable decreased principally due to the decreased level of sales on credit during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the sales during the period leading up to June 30, 2022. From time to time, we have offered
extended Traditional segment customer payment terms beyond 90 days to certain credit-worthy customers. Because of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the global economy, the extension of these terms may not immediately increase liquidity as a
result of ongoing current-period sales, which we expect may continue to be pressured due to the effects of the ongoing pandemic. In addition, we believe our competitors and other vendors in the wholesale jewelry industry have expanded their use of
extended payment terms and, in aggregate, we believe that, through our use of extended payment terms, we provide a competitive response in our market during the current global economic environment. We believe that we are unable to estimate the
impact of these actions on our net sales, but we believe that if we ceased providing extended payment terms, we would be at a competitive disadvantage for some Traditional segment customers in the marketplace during this economic period and that
our net sales and profits would likely be adversely impacted.
We manufactured approximately $8.77 million in finished jewelry and $4.89 million in loose jewels, which includes the cost of the loose jewels and the purchase of precious metals and labor in connection with jewelry production, during the six
months ended December 31, 2022. We expect our purchases of precious metals and labor to increase as we increase our finished jewelry business. In addition, the price of gold has fluctuated significantly over the past decade, resulting in higher
retail price points for gold jewelry. Because the market prices of gold and other precious metals are beyond our control, upward price trends could have a negative impact on our operating cash flow as we manufacture finished jewelry.
Historically, our raw material inventories of SiC crystals had been purchased under exclusive supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers. Because the supply agreements restricted the sale of these crystals exclusively to us, the
suppliers negotiated minimum purchase commitments with us that, when combined with reduced sales levels during prior periods in which the purchase commitments were in effect, have resulted in levels of inventories that are higher than we might
otherwise maintain. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $21.90 million and $22.49 million of our inventories were classified as long-term assets. Loose jewel sales and finished jewelry that we manufacture will utilize both the finished goods
loose jewels currently on-hand and, as we deplete certain shapes and sizes, our on-hand raw material SiC crystals of $1.46 million and new raw material that we purchase pursuant to the Supply Agreement.
Our more detailed description of our inventories is included in Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements”, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
As of December 31, 2022, all of our remaining federal income tax credits had expired or been utilized, and therefore, are not available to be carried forward to offset future income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, we also had a federal tax net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $16.53 million expiring between 2034 and 2037, or that have no expiration, which can be used to offset against future federal taxable income; North Carolina tax net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $19.77 million expiring between 2023 and 2035; and various other state tax net operating loss carryforwards expiring between 2023 and 2040, which can be used to offset against future state taxable income.
Short-Term Capital Resources
Line of Credit
Effective July 7, 2021, we obtained from JPMorgan Chase our $5.00 million cash collateralized JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility. The JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility may be used for general corporate and working capital
purposes, including permitted acquisitions and certain additional indebtedness for
borrowed money, installment obligations, and
obligations under capital and operating leases.
The
JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility is secured by a cash deposit in the amount of $5.05 million held by JPMorgan Chase as collateral for the
line of credit facility . Effective July 28, 2022,
the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date to July 31, 2023, and append our obligations under the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility to be guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries, Charles &
Colvard Direct, LLC, charlesandcolvard.com, LLC, and moissaniteoutlet.com, LLC.

Table of Contents
Each advance under the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility, as amended, accrues interest at a rate equal to the sum of JPMorgan Chase’s monthly secured overnight financing rate, or the SOFR rate, to which JPMorgan Chase is subject with respect to the
adjusted SOFR rate as established by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, plus a margin of 1.25% per annum and an unsecured to secured interest rate adjustment of 0.10% per annum. Prior to its amendment, each advance under the JPMorgan Chase Credit
Facility would have accrued interest at a rate equal to JPMorgan Chase’s monthly LIBOR rate multiplied by a statutory reserve rate for eurocurrency funding to which JPMorgan Chase is subject with respect to the adjusted LIBOR rate as established by
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, plus a margin of 1.25% per annum. Interest is calculated monthly on an actual/360-day basis and payable monthly in arrears. Principal outstanding during an event of default, at JPMorgan Chase’s option, accrues
interest at a rate of 3% per annum in excess of the above rate. Any advance may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time.
As of December 31, 2022, we had not borrowed against the JPMorgan Chase Credit Facility.
Long-Term Capital Commitment
Contractual Agreement
On December 12, 2014, we entered into the Supply Agreement with Cree, Inc., now known as Wolfspeed, Inc., or Wolfspeed. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Wolfspeed, and
Wolfspeed agreed to exclusively supply, 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 24, 2018, unless
extended by the parties. Effective June 22, 2018, the Supply Agreement was amended to extend the expiration date to June 25, 2023. The Supply Agreement, as amended, also provides for the exclusive production of the raw materials used in our premium
moissanite product, Forever One™ and provided us with one option, subject to certain conditions, to unilaterally extend the term of the Supply Agreement for an additional two-year period following the expiration of the initial term. In addition,
the amendment to the Supply Agreement established a process by which Wolfspeed may begin producing alternate SiC material based on our specifications that will give us the flexibility to use the materials in a broader variety of our products, as
well as to permit us to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. On August 26, 2020, the Supply Agreement was further amended, effective June 30, 2020, to extend the expiration date to June 29, 2025,
which may be further extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply Agreement was also amended to, among other things, ( i ) spread our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement in the
amount of approximately $52.95 million over the term of the Supply Agreement, as amended; ( ii ) establish a process by which Wolfspeed has agreed to accept purchase orders in excess of the agreed-upon minimum
purchase commitment, subject to certain conditions; and ( iii ) permit us to purchase revised amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. Our total purchase commitment under the
Supply Agreement, as amended, until June 2025 is approximately $52.95 million, of which approximately $24.75 million remains to be purchased as of December 31, 2022.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased approximately $1.80 million and $3.00 million, respectively, of SiC crystals from Wolfspeed pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended. Going forward, we expect
to use existing cash and cash equivalents and access to other working capital resources, including but not limited to the potential issuance of equity securities, together with future cash expected to be provided by our operating activities to make
purchases in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended.
Liquidity and Capital Trends
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be provided by operating activities combined will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next twelve months.
From a long-term perspective, we believe that our ongoing access to capital markets, including but not limited to the issuance of equity securities or even potential debt securities, coupled with cash provided by operating activities in future
periods beyond the next twelve months, will continue to provide us with the necessary liquidity to meet our long-term working capital and capital expenditure requirements.

Table of Contents
In connection with our short- and long-term capital resources, we have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that allows us to periodically offer and sell, individually or in any combination, shares of common
stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, and units consisting of any combination of the foregoing types of securities, up to a total of $25.00 million, of which all is available. However, we
may offer and sell no more than one-third of our public float (which is the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates) in any 12-month period. As outlined above under the caption,
Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Structure,
our ability to issue equity securities under the shelf registration statement is subject to market conditions, which may be in turn, subject to, among other things, the potential
disruption and volatility that may be caused by ongoing macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risks associated with the potential delisting of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to regain compliance with
applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules within the periods of time described therein. Accordingly, a ny capital raise is not assured and these conditions may
adversely affect our ability to
raise capital under the shelf registration statement, if at all .
Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including
the ongoing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 that could lead to further disruption and volatility in the
global capital markets
as well as its impact on our rate of sales growth; the expansion of our sales and marketing activities; the timing and extent of raw materials and labor purchases in connection with loose jewel production to support
our moissanite jewels and lab grown diamond business and precious metals and labor purchases in connection with jewelry production to support our finished jewelry business; the timing of capital expenditures; and the risk factors described in more
detail in “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on
such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We routinely review our internal control over financial reporting and from time to time make changes intended to enhance the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and will take action as appropriate. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we made no changes to our internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that we believe materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors
We discuss in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 various risks that may materially affect our business. There have been no
material changes to such risks, except as set forth below.
Our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions.
Our business, including our sales volumes and
overall profitability, depends on consumer demand for our products and could be adversely impacted further by unfavorable general economic conditions, declines in consumer confidence and consumer disposable income, rising energy and fuel prices,
increasing freight costs, rising inflation rates, recession and fears of recession, consumer debt levels, increased interest rates, and higher tax rates. Our business could also be adversely impacted by possible disruptions in global financial
markets, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in economic growth, increased unemployment levels, and uncertainty about economic stability, including the increased risk of global trade tensions and geopolitical
unrest such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and domestic political and geopolitical instability. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the effects of these disruptions in the financial markets and the
adverse domestic and global economic conditions, and if these economic conditions deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Ongoing unfavorable economic conditions may continue to lead consumers to further delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and projected consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. The consequences of
such adverse effects could also include interruptions or delays in our suppliers’ performance of our contracts, reductions and delays in customer purchases, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, and
bankruptcy of customers or suppliers. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could also slow the pace of any planned future showroom openings that we may have going forward.
Luxury products, such as fine jewelry, are discretionary purchases for consumers. Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher freight costs, higher inflation rates, higher levels of
unemployment, adverse conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, tighter access to consumer credit, increased consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or
buying habits could materially and adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, volatility in the financial markets has had and may continue to have a negative impact on consumer spending patterns. A reduction in consumer spending or
disposable income may affect us more significantly than companies in other industries and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our future financial performance depends upon increased consumer acceptance, growth of sales of our products, and operational execution of our strategic initiatives.
We believe that
most consumers are not generally aware of the existence and attributes of moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds and that the consumer market for moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry featuring both moissanite and lab grown
diamonds remains in the early stages of development and consumer acceptance. The degree of future market acceptance and demand is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, upon greater
consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds as an ethically sourced, affordable, luxurious alternative to other gemstones, such as a mined diamond, and our ability to develop brands and execute strategic initiatives,
particularly in our Online Channels segment, to grow our sales and operating income. As we execute our strategy to build and reinvest in our business, significant expenses and investment of cash will be required going forward and this may adversely
affect our operating income. If we are unable to execute and achieve desired revenue levels, we may adjust our strategic initiatives in response to the results of our investments.
In addition, consumer acceptance may be affected by retail jewelers’ and jewelry manufacturers’ acceptance of moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry featuring both moissanite and lab grown diamonds. The quality, design, and
workmanship of the jewelry settings, whether manufactured by us or other manufacturers, could affect both consumers’ perception and acceptance of our products and costs incurred by returns and markdowns.

Table of Contents
Therefore, as other competitors enter the moissanite and lab grown diamond market, we could face market share and pricing pressures for our own products. In addition, the lower quality of competitors’ gemstones could negatively impact consumer
perception of moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds, and in turn, acceptance of our jewels.
Thus, our future financial performance may be affected by:
•
Our ability to develop and promote the Charles & Colvard brands, such as
Forever One ™ ,
Moissanite by Charles & Colvard ® , and
Caydia ® , all of which are used in finished jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds, which may in part drive interest and demand for moissanite and lab grown diamond jewelry at the
consumer level;
•
Our ability to differentiate
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite ®   and
Caydia ®
from competing products,
including competitive moissanite and the rapidly emerging lab grown diamond industry;
•
Our ability to operationally execute our digital marketing strategy for our Online Channels segment;
•
Our continued ability and the ability of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry;
•
Our ability to understand our consumer market segment and effectively market to them a compelling value proposition that leads to converted customers;
•
Our ability to continue our relationship with Wolfspeed in order to sustain our supply of high-quality SiC crystals;
•
The continued willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers, manufacturers, and designers to market and promote
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite ®
and
Caydia ®
to the retail jewelry
trade;
•
The continued willingness of distributors, retailers, and others in our distribution channels to purchase loose

as well as their continued willingness of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels;
•
Our continued ability and the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds in finished jewelry with high-quality workmanship; and
•
Our continued ability and the ability of retail jewelers, including that of our internal retail jewelry marketing team in connection with the
Charles & Colvard Signature Showroom , which is
our first retail jewelry brick-and-mortar location that we opened in October 2022, to effectively market and sell finished jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds to consumers.
Our failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock .
Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On December 19, 2022, we received a notification letter from
Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), because the minimum bid price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has closed below $1.00 per share for 30
consecutive business days. The notification letter has no immediate effect on the Nasdaq listing or trading in our common stock. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days, or until June 19, 2023, to regain
compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement. To regain compliance, any time before June 19, 2023, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On June
19, 2023, if we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market (except for the minimum bid price requirement), and we notify Nasdaq of our
intent to cure the deficiency, we may be provided with an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to regain compliance. If we are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, Nasdaq will provide us with written
notification that our common stock will be subject to delisting. Upon such notice, we may appeal Nasdaq’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearing panel. There can be no assurance that, if we appeal Nasdaq’s determination, such appeal would be
successful.

While we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance during the applicable time periods set forth above. If we
fail to continue to meet all applicable listing requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our
common stock; adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, if at all; and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, employees, and fewer business development opportunities.
Additionally, the market price of our common stock may decline further and shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.
