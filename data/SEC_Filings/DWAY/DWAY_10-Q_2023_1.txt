DriveItAway Holdings, Inc.
Notes to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
Unaudited
Note 1 –  Organization, Description of
Business and Going Concern
Nature of Organization
DriveItAway Holdings, Inc.
(“DIA Holdings”, “the Company”, “we” or “us”) was formed in Delaware on March 8, 2006
as B2 Health, Inc. On July 2, 2010, the Company acquired BFK Franchise Company, LLC (“BFK”), a Nevada limited liability company,
and concurrently changed its name to Creative Learning Corporation. On February 24, 2022, the Company acquired DriveItAway, Inc., and
on March 18, 2022, disposed of BFK and its other subsidiaries involved in the learning business. On April 18, 2022, the name was changed
to DriveItAway Holdings, Inc.
DIA
Holdings is a national dealer focused mobility platform that enables car dealers to sell more vehicles in a seamless way through eCommerce,
with its exclusive “Pay as You Go” app-based subscription program. DIA provides a comprehensive turnkey, solutions driven
program with proprietary mobile technology and driver app, insurance coverages and training to get dealerships up and running quickly
and profitably in emerging online sales opportunities. The company is planning to soon expand its easy and transparent consumer app ‘subscription
to ownership’ platform to enable entry level consumers to drive and acquire new Electric Vehicles. For further information, please
see  www.driveitaway.com .
Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements are
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) of the United States, applicable to a
going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $ 721,008
and cash used in operating activities of $ 193,541 .
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 3,101,767 .
The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and will require additional capital to continue its
operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund
operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company includes:
sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders
sufficient to meet its minimum operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful
in accomplishing this plan.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able
to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance
that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance
with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP for interim financial information in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the Company’s opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended December
31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. While management of the Company believes that the disclosures
presented herein are adequate and not misleading, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and the footnotes thereto for the year ended September 30, 2022, contained in the Company’s Form 10K, as filed on January
13, 2023.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of DriveItAway Holdings Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary DriveItAway, Inc., collectively
referred to as the “Company”. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates and assumptions made by management include allowance for doubtful
accounts, allowance for deferred tax assets, fair value of equity instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates as the
current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid securities
with original maturities of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022,
the Company had cash of $ 40,130  and
$ 127,109 ,
respectively and did not have any cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
The Company reviews accounts receivable periodically
for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and records bad debt expense when deemed necessary. The Company
records an allowance for doubtful accounts that is based on historical trends, customer knowledge, any known disputes, and considers
the aging of the accounts receivable balances combined with management’s estimate of future potential recoverability. Accounts
and receivables are written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed. The Company believes its
allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are adequate, but actual write-offs could exceed the
recorded allowance. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 the balances in the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.
Financial
Instruments
The Company
follows ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)
an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1
Level 1 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient
volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can
be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
F- 7
Level 3
Level 3 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying
amounts shown of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expense, accounts payable,
and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Vehicles
Vehicles are recorded at cost and depreciated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of seven (7) years. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Major improvements, which extend the useful life of the related asset, are capitalized. Upon disposal of a vehicle, we record a gain or
loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed vehicle. We remove fully depreciated
vehicles from the cost and accumulated depreciation amounts disclosed.
Website and Software Development Costs
The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website
and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs,
if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed
as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software that result in added functionality,
in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Amortization expense related
to capitalized website and software development costs is included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
Capitalized development activities placed in service
are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at three (3) years. The estimated useful lives
of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities
that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality. We remove fully amortized website and software
development costs from the cost and accumulated amortization amounts disclosed.
Construction-in-progress primarily consists of website development costs
that are capitalizable, but for which the associated applications have not been placed in service.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair value of an embedded conversion option that
is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price protection reset provision features are deemed to be “down-round
protection” and, therefore, do not meet the scope exception for treatment as a derivative under ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”,
since “down-round protection” is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion option and warrants
and cannot be considered “indexed to the Company’s own stock” which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined
under ASC 815.
F- 8
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments
requires that the Company record embedded conversion options and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement
and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or
expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments
at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of
the date of the event that caused the reclassification.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was used
to estimate the fair value of the embedded conversion options and warrants. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can
materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time,
of our common stock, equal to the weighted average life of the options.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue is recognized in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for all periods presented. The
Company, through its DriveItAway online/app-based platform, operates in the retail automotive industry. The Company assists subprime and
deep subprime candidates, with little or no down payment, in purchasing the used vehicle of his/her choice by first starting in an app
based, turnkey rental, through participating franchise and independent car dealers. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
the Company derived its rental revenue from contract revenue share for rentals between participating franchise and independent car dealers
and individual car rental customers (“customers”). In conjunction with the rental revenue, the Company generates revenue by
providing driver and vehicle insurance through a third party, included in the rental contract with each customer.
The Company’s performance obligation for rental
revenue is to provide an application to track car rental arrangements and to collect cash from car rental customers and remit those payments
to participating franchise and independent car dealers, net of the Company’s revenue share. The car rental arrangements are over
a fixed contracted period; therefore, the Company recognizes revenue ratably during the contract term. The Company’s performance
obligation for insurance revenue is to collect insurance fees from the customer and provide the third-party provider payment for the insurance
provided to the customer. The insurance is offered over a fixed contracted period; therefore, the Company recognizes revenue ratably during
the contract term.
Rental and insurance transactions are prepaid at the
beginning of the rental cycle (typically a one-week rental that has an automatic renewal) with an automatic charge to the customer’s
credit card on file through the DIA system. The DIA system then distributes the vehicle owner share (typically 85% of rental revenue)
to the vehicle owner’s bank account from the Stripe Account. This amount is shown as a deduction to Revenues (“Vehicle Owner
Share”) on the Company’s Statements of Operations. The net amount is then transferred from the Company’s Stripe Account
to the DIA operating bank account. DIA also distributes insurance amounts due to the third - party insurance provider on a monthly
basis. This amount is shown as a deduction to revenues (“Driver & Dealer Insurance Cost”) on the Company’s Statements
of Operations.
F- 9
DIA also generates miscellaneous revenue in a number
of ways. At the end of the rental term, the DIA software system checks for any excess usage and charges, based on the terms of the rental
contract, and will automatically charge a customer’s credit card. These charges are recognized when the credit card charge goes
through and recorded as miscellaneous revenue on the Company’s Statements of Operations. Additional miscellaneous revenue represents
amounts earned on telematics equipment and telematics software services related to each rental vehicle used to track excess usage and
charges. DIA performance obligation is to provide the equipment to the vehicle owner for self-installation and allow access to the software
throughout the rental term. The Company recognizes revenue when the equipment is delivered to the vehicle owner. Miscellaneous revenue
associated with use of the telematics software is recognized on a monthly basis.
The Company’s Cost of Goods sold consists of
direct expenses, such as roadside assistance or telematics service fees, and credit card fees incurred from the cash collections and cash
remittance process, as a significant portion of its performance obligation is to collect and remit payments through its credit card processors.
General Advertising Costs
General advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred general advertising costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $ 8,551  and
$ 2,501 , respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation expense for all
restricted stock awards and stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards is measured using the grant date fair value of our
stock, as determined by the Board of Directors. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service
period. We have elected to recognize compensation expense for all options with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of the entire option. The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by our stock value as well
as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected stock price volatility and the risk-free interest
rate.
Income Taxes
The provision
for income taxes and deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on temporary differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. On a periodic basis, the Company assesses
the probability that its net deferred tax assets, if any, will be recovered. If after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence,
a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered, a
valuation allowance is provided by a charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are not expected to
be realized.
Net Loss per Share
of Common Stock
The Company
calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common
stock are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares and potential shares outstanding during the period.
Potential shares of common stock consist of shares issuable upon the conversion of outstanding convertible debt, preferred stock, warrants
and stock option. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the following common stock equivalents were excluded from the
computation of diluted net loss per share as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive. .

Note 5 –  Equity
Authorized
On April 18, 2022, the Company filed Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize one billion ( 1,000,000,000 ) shares of common
stock having a par value of $ 0.0001  per share, and ten million ( 10,000,000 ) shares of preferred stock having a par value of $ 0.0001  per
share. All or any part of the capital stock may be issued by the Corporation from time to time and for such consideration and on such
terms as may be determined and fixed by the Board of Directors, without action of the stockholders, as provided by law, unless the Board
of Directors deems it advisable to obtain the advice of the stockholders.
Series A Preferred Stock
The Company has authorized one series of preferred
stock, which is known as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “ Series A Preferred ”). The Board has
authorized the issuance of  5,000,000  shares of Series A Preferred. The Series A Preferred Stock has the following rights and
preferences:
Dividends :
The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends equal to the amount of dividends that the holder of such
share would have received if such share of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
record date of the dividend declared on the Common Stock.
Liquidation
Preference :  The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to any junior class of securities,
an amount equal to $0.01 per share as a liquidation preference before any distribution may be made to the holders of any junior security,
including the Common Stock.
Voting Rights :  Each
holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall vote with holders of the Common Stock upon any matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, in
which event it shall have the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred
Stock would be convertible on the record date for the vote or consent of shareholders. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall also
be entitled to one vote per share on each submitted to a class vote of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.
Voluntary
Conversion Rights :  Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 33.94971 shares of Common Stock at the option
of the holder thereof.
Mandatory
Conversion Right :  The Company has the right to convert each share of Series A Preferred Stock into 33.94971 shares of Common
Stock at any time that there are less than 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company
issued  300,000  shares
of DIA common stock which was automatically converted into  300,000  shares
of Series A Preferred at the closing of the Share Exchange on February 24, 2022. The shares were issued to a consulting firm pursuant
to one year consulting agreement and valued at $ 692,308 .
Stock-based compensation expense related to this issuance for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 0
and $ 173,077 , respectively,
and was included in general and administrative expense .
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had  0  and  2,300,000  shares
of Series A Preferred stock outstanding, respectively.
F- 11
Common Stock
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company issued.
● 1,000,000  shares
of common stock valued at $ 1,509  for commitment fees in conjunction with the issuance
of promissory note of $ 750,000
(see Note 6).
● 250,000  shares
of common stock valued at $ 15,000 , for consulting services, based on the fair market value
of the shares on the grant date.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, no common stock was issued.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had
106,551,722
and  0  common shares issued, respectively.
Treasury stock
The
Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock is comprised of shares of common stock purchased by the Company in the
secondary market. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had  15,100  and
0 shares of treasury stock valued at $ 18,126
and $0, respectively .
Warrants
In November 2022, in conjunction with a private offering
and the issuance of secured promissory notes of $ 200,000 , the Company issued  100,000  warrants for $ 0.30  per share. The
transaction led to no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon future settlement of the conversion options, therefore
the warrants qualified for derivative accounting and were assigned a value of $ 3,555  which was recorded as a derivative liability
and debt discount. The warrants expire in November 2027.
All warrants issued were valued using the Black-Scholes
pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free
interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these
inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement (see Note 8).

Note 7 –  Convertible Notes Payable
AJB Capital Investments, LLC Note
Effective February 24, 2022
and as amended October 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with AJB Capital Investments,
LLC (“AJB”), and issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 750,000  (the “AJB Note”) to AJB in
a private transaction for a purchase price of $ 675,000  (after giving effect to a 10% original issue discount). In connection with

AJB Note was extended to  February 24, 2023 . The AJB Note bears interest at  10 % per annum for the original note’s period
and 12% per annum for extension period which was started from August 24, 2022, and it is payable on the first of each month beginning
April 1, 2022. The Company may prepay the AJB Note at any time without penalty.
The note is convertible into Common Stock of the Company
at any time that the note is in default, provided that at no time may the note be convertible into an amount of common stock that would
result in the holder having beneficial ownership of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock, as determined in accordance
with Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The conversion price equals the lowest
trading price during either the 20 days trading days prior to the date of conversion or the 20 trading days prior to the date of issuance
of the note (which was $0.14 per share). The conversion is subject to reduction in the following situations: (i) a 10% discount will apply
anytime a conversion occurs when the company is not eligible to deliver the shares by DWAC; (ii) a 15% discount will apply whenever the
shares are “chilled” for deposit into the DTC system; (iii) a 15% discount will apply if the Company’s common stock
ceases to be registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; (iv) a 15% discount will apply if the note cannot be converted into free
trading shares 181 days after its issue date; (v) in the event any other party has the right to convert debt into Common Stock at a greater
discount to market than under the note, then the holder has the right to utilize such discount in determining the conversion price; or
(vi) if the Company issues any shares of Common Stock for less than the conversion price in effect on the date of issuance, including
any options, warrants or securities convertible into Common Stock at price less than the conversion price, then the conversion price shall
be automatically reduced to the amount of consideration received by the company for such shares, except for any issuance that is an exempt
issuance.
Also pursuant to the
SPA, the Company was to pay AJB a commitment fee of $ 800,000 ,
payable in the form of  5,000,000  unregistered
shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Commitment Fee Shares”) which
4,000,000
shares were issued at note inception and
1,000,000
shares on the October 31, 2022 amendment. If, after the sixth month anniversary of closing and before the
thirty-sixth month anniversary of closing, AJB has been unable to sell the Commitment Fee Shares for $ 800,000 ,
then the Company may be required to issue additional shares or pay cash in the amount of the shortfall. However, if the Company pays
the AJB Note off on or before its maturity date, then the Company may redeem  2,000,000  of
the Commitment Fee Shares for one dollar and the amount of the commitment fee will be reduced to $ 400,000 .
On issuance of the note, the Company determined that the guarantee on the commitment fee was a make-whole provision and an embedded
derivative within the host instrument. The guarantee was bifurcated from the host instrument and recorded as a derivative liability
valued at $ 385,796  using
a Black-Scholes option pricing model (see Note 8).
Pursuant to the SPA, the
Company also issued to AJB common stock purchase warrants (the “warrants”) to purchase  1,000,000  shares of the Company’s
common stock for $ 0.30  per share, which was assigned a value of $ 107,283  that was recorded as derivative liability. The warrants
expire on  February 24, 2027 . The warrants also include various covenants of the Company for the benefit of the warrant holder and
includes a beneficial ownership limitation on the holder that, in certain circumstances, may serve to restrict the holder’s right
to exercise the warrants.
F- 13
After
recording the derivative liabilities associated with the SPA, the Company allocated the net proceeds to the  4,000,000  common
shares issued and the note itself based on their relative fair market values, resulting in the common shares being assigned a value of
$ 65,274 . The allocation of the financing costs of $ 108,750 , the derivative for the guarantee of $ 384,287 , the derivative for the warrant
of $ 107,283 , and issuance of the  4,000,000  Commitment Fee shares of $ 65,274 , to the debt component resulted in a $ 665,594  debt
discount that is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the AJB Note.
On October 31, 2022,
the Company amended the AJB Note to issue
1,000,000
additional Commitment Fee Shares. The Company determined, pursuant to ASC 470-50, the amendment to be a modification of the AJB Note
and accounted for the Commitment Fee Shares as an additional make-whole provision and recorded a day 1 derivative liability valued
at $ 1,509 ,
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model (see Note 8).
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
recorded interest expense of $ 23,000 ,
additional debt discount of $ 1,509 ,
amortization of debt discount of $ 794 ,
a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of $ 352,627
for the guarantee and warrants and repaid $ 23,542
of interest. As of December 31, 2022, the derivative liability was $ 450,556  and
the debt discount recorded on the note was $ 715 ,
resulting in a note payable balance of $ 749,285 .
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company owed unpaid interest of $ 1,213
and $ 1,755 .
Secured Convertible Notes
In June
2022, the Company’s board of directors approved an offering of up to  10  Units
at $ 50,000  per
Unit in a private offering. Each Unit consists of a Secured Convertible Note with an original principal balance of $ 50,000  and
one warrant to purchase Common Stock for every $2 invested in the offering. The warrants have an exercise price of $ 0.30  per
share and expire five ( 5 )
years from the date of issuance. Each Secured Convertible Note bears interest at  15 %
per annum, matures two years after the date of issuance, and is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock at
$ 0.20  per
share. Pursuant to a security agreement between the Company and investors in the Unit offering, and the subscription agreements
executed by the Company and the investors, the Secured Convertible Notes are secured by
liens
on four
existing electric vehicles that were owned by the Company at the time of the commencement of the offering, and eight
additional electric vehicles that will be purchased with the proceeds of the offering, assuming all 10 Units are sold in the
offering. The Company also granted subscribers in the Unit offering piggyback registration rights with respect to any shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Secured Convertible Notes or upon exercise of the warrants issued in the Unit
offering.
During June
2022, the Company sold a total of $ 250,000  worth
of Units to two accredited investors, which resulted in the issuance of two secured promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount
of $ 250,000  for
cash proceeds of $ 230,000 ,
and the issuance of  125,000  warrants.  The
conversion option embedded in the notes was bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability resulting in the Company recording
a debt discount and derivative liability of $ 50,491 .  The
allocation of the warrant to the debt component resulted in the Company recording a debt discount and derivative liability of $ 8,136 .
The cash issuance discount resulted in the recording of a debt discount of $ 20,000 . The total debt discount of $ 78,627  is
being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note.
During November
2022, the Company sold a total of $ 200,000  worth of Units to two accredited investors, which resulted in the issuance of two secured
promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $ 200,000  for cash proceeds of $ 180,000 , and the issuance of  100,000  warrants.  The
conversion option embedded in the notes was bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability resulting in the Company recording
a debt discount and derivative liability of $ 19,330 .  The allocation of the
warrant to the debt component resulted in the Company recording a debt discount and derivative liability of $ 3,794 . The cash issuance
discount resulted in the recording of a debt discount of $ 20,000 . The total debt discount of $ 43,124  is being amortized to interest
expense over the term of the Note.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company recorded interest expense of $ 13,614 , and amortization of debt discount of $ 12,627 . As of December 31, 2022 and September 30,
2022, the debt discount recorded on the notes was $ 97,157
and $ 66,660 , resulting in a note payable balance of $ 352,842
and $ 183,340 , respectively.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company owed accrued interest of $ 16,847
and $ 11,583 , respectively.
Note 8 –  Derivative Liabilities
Certain features and instruments issued as part of
the Company’s debt financing arrangements qualified for derivative accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as the
number of common shares that are to be issued under the arrangements are indeterminate, therefore the Company’s equity environment
is tainted.
F- 14
ASC 815 requires we record the fair market value of
the derivative liabilities at inception and at the end of each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as other
income or expense item.
The Company determined our derivative liabilities
to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair values at inception and as of December
31, 2022. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free interest
rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs
could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes model during
the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and year ended September 30, 2022 :

cover operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company owed related
parties $ 80 , for this activity.
Note 10 –  Subsequent Events
Management has evaluated subsequent events through
the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation no material events have occurred that require
disclosure.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company and
AJB entered into the Second Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Second Amended SPA”) to amend the AJB
Note (see Note 7) reflecting certain additional amendments in contemplation of the Note Amendment, and the Amended and Restated
Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the “Amended Warrant”), as defined below.
Under the terms of the
Second Amended SPA, AJB increased the principal of the AJB Note by $ 85,000
and extended the maturity date to May 24, 2023. As
consideration for the Amended Note and Second Amended SPA, the Company issued AJB the Amended Warrant, pursuant to which the number
of shares issuable under the Amended Warrant will be increased to
2,000,000
and the exercise price redefined to be $ 0.05 .
The Amended Warrant also includes various covenants of the Company for the benefit of the warrant holder and includes a beneficial
ownership limitation on the holder that, in certain circumstances, may serve to restrict the holder’s right to exercise the
Amended Warrant. In addition, the Amended Warrant also contains certain conditions in which the exercise price may be adjusted, as
well as registration rights by AJB of the shares underlying the warrants.
In addition, the Company and AJB entered into a side
letter agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed that AJB shall (i) withhold an aggregate of $ 3,500
from the proceeds under the
Amended Note to reimburse AJB for legal and due diligence expenses, and (ii) disburse the remainder of the proceeds directly to certain
service providers of the Company pursuant to the Company’s instructions and as provided in the Amended Note and the Second Amended
SPA, rather than directly to the Company.

Revenues for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, increased $37,466, from $10,617 for the period ending December 31, 2021, to $48,083 for the period ending December
31, 2022. This was primarily due to the somewhat greater availability of the supply of vehicles on our platform through a sublease arrangement,
a derivative of the lessoning effect of the nation-wide car shortage resulting from supply chain disruptions due in part to the COVID-19
pandemic, and the gradual increase in supply of, semiconductor chips, one of the main components that run vehicle electronics.
We anticipate that, in 2023
automotive supply and demand will return to a more historically normal levels which should translate into greater vehicle availability
for vehicles on our platform, leading to a further increase in revenues.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased
$34,186, from $5,686 for the period ending December 31, 2021, to $39,872 for the period ending December 31, 2022. This was primarily due
to one-time fees in preparing a sublease car for rental, including telematics product and install fees, pick up and transport fees, etc.
In general, each time a new vehicle is introduced on our platform, there are fees associated to the initial preparation.
Operating expenses for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $50,260 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in professional fees of $72,647, however, we had increases in salaries and payroll taxes of $11,750, and other
operating expenses of $10,637.
Loss from operations was
$215,433 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $268,973 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
of $53,540 was largely attributable to the change in operating expenses.
Other expenses for the three
months ended December, 2022 were $505,575, as compared to a gain of $17,252 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For 2022 we
incurred a loss on change in fair value of derivative of $454,655, amortization of debt discounts on our convertible notes of $13,420,
and interest expense of $37,500. For 2021, the gain was primarily attributable to the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection (PPP) loan
of $24,148 and expense for interest of $6,896.

December 31, 2021, the Company generated $100,000 from issuance of convertible notes and $36,200 from the SBA loan.
Going Concern
As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had a net loss of $721,008, accumulated deficit of $3,101,767 and did not have sufficient cash on hand to cover expenses for
the next twelve (12) months. The Company intends to convert its convertible debt into common stock and to fund operations through equity
financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the
year ending September 30, 2023.
3
The ability of our Company
to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and
development of our business plan. In response to these requirements, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private
placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates
Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which require
management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
●
Revenue
Recognition
●
Stock-Based
Compensation
●
Income
Taxes
●
Financial Instruments
●
Derivative
Financial Instruments
While our estimates and assumptions
are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these
estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s
revenue is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
for all periods presented. The Company, through its DriveItAway online/app-based platform, operates in the retail automotive industry.
The Company assists subprime and deep subprime candidates, with little or no down payment, in purchasing the used vehicle of his/her choice
by first starting in an app based, turnkey rental, through participating franchise and independent car dealers. During the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company derived its rental revenue from contract revenue share for rentals between participating
franchise and independent car dealers and individual car rental customers (“customers”). In conjunction with the rental revenue,
the Company generates revenue by providing driver and vehicle insurance through a third party, included in the rental contract with each
customer.
The Company’s performance
obligation for rental revenue is to provide an application to track car rental arrangements and to collect cash from car rental customers
and remit those payments to participating franchise and independent car dealers, net of the Company’s revenue share. The car rental
arrangements are over a fixed contracted period; therefore, the Company recognizes revenue ratably during the contract term. The Company’s
performance obligation for insurance revenue is to collect insurance fees from the customer and provide the third-party provider payment
for the insurance provided to the customer. The insurance is offered over a fixed contracted period; therefore, the Company recognizes
revenue ratably during the contract term.
Rental and insurance transactions
are prepaid at the beginning of the rental cycle (typically a one-week rental that has an automatic renewal) with an automatic charge
to the customer’s credit card on file through the DIA system. The DIA system then distributes the vehicle owner share (typically
85% of rental revenue) to the vehicle owner’s bank account from the Stripe Account. This amount is shown as a deduction to Revenues
(“Vehicle Owner Share”) on the Company’s Statements of Operations. The net amount is then transferred from the Company’s
Stripe Account to the DIA operating bank account. DIA also distributes insurance amounts due to the third - party insurance provider
on a monthly basis. This amount is shown as a deduction to revenues (“Driver & Dealer Insurance Cost”) on the Company’s
Statements of Operations.
DIA also generates miscellaneous
revenue in a number of ways. At the end of the rental term, the DIA software system checks for any excess usage and charges, based on
the terms of the rental contract, and will automatically charge a customer’s credit card. These charges are recognized when the
credit card charge goes through and recorded as miscellaneous revenue on the Company’s Statements of Operations. Additional miscellaneous
revenue represents amounts earned on telematics equipment and telematics software services related to each rental vehicle used to track
excess usage and charges. DIA performance obligation is to provide the equipment to the vehicle owner for self-installation and allow
access to the software throughout the rental term. The Company recognizes revenue when the equipment is delivered to the vehicle owner.
Miscellaneous revenue associated with use of the telematics software is recognized on a monthly basis.
4
The Company’s Cost
of Goods sold consists of direct expenses, such as roadside assistance or telematics service fees, and credit card fees incurred from
the cash collections and cash remittance process, as a significant portion of its performance obligation is to collect and remit payments
through its credit card processors.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation
expense for all restricted stock awards and stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards is measured using the grant date
fair value of our stock, as determined by the Board of Directors. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the
requisite service period. We have elected to recognize compensation expense for all options with graded vesting on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period of the entire option. The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by our
stock value as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected stock price volatility and
the risk-free interest rate.
Income Taxes
The provision
for income taxes and deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on temporary differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. On a periodic basis, the Company assesses
the probability that its net deferred tax assets, if any, will be recovered. If after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence,
a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered, a
valuation allowance is provided by a charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are not expected to
be realized.
Financial
Instruments
The Company
follows ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)
an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1
Level 1 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2
Level 2 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient
volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can
be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level
3
Level 3 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying
amounts shown of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expense, accounts payable,
and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair value of an embedded
conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price protection reset provision features
are deemed to be “down-round protection” and, therefore, do not meet the scope exception for treatment as a derivative under
ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”, since “down-round protection” is not an input into the calculation of the fair
value of the conversion option and warrants and cannot be considered “indexed to the Company’s own stock” which is a
requirement for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815.
The accounting treatment
of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record embedded conversion options and warrants at their fair values as
of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded
as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification
of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract
is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.
The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the embedded conversion options and warrants. The model includes subjective input
assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical
period of time, of our common stock, equal to the weighted average life of the options.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet
arrangements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
Our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that in light of the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. See material weaknesses discussed below in Management’s Annual Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
(b)
Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditure are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
As of December 31, 2022,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the following identified material weaknesses:
●
Our
control environment is inadequate. We have no risk assessment procedures, no formal information or communication process, and no
monitoring activities in place. Additionally, we lack policies that require formal written approval for related party transactions.
●
We
have not established and/or maintained adequately designed internal controls in order to prevent or detect and correct material misstatements
to the financial statements. We do not have controls in place to prevent individuals from manipulating financial data or entering
inaccurate data into the accounting software, and there are no controls over the financial reporting close process. Additionally,
we lack segregation of duties and review procedures to ensure our financial data is accurate.
●
We
lack the necessary accounting resources with sufficient SEC reporting experience, US GAAP knowledge and accounting experience. We
also lack the resources to properly account for complex debt and equity transactions and are unable to analyze such transactions
timely or in sufficient detail.
6
Management believes that
despite our material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 are fairly stated, in all
material respects, in accordance with GAAP.
(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended
December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls
Management, including our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are no resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
