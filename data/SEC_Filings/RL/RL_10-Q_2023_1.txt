See accompanying notes. 7 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In millions, except per share data and where otherwise indicated) (Unaudited) 1.     Description of Business Ralph Lauren Corporation ("RLC") is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality. RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves," unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home. The Company organizes its business into the following
three
reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 17 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure. 2.     Basis of Presentation Interim Financial Statements These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented. In addition, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP") and the notes thereto have been condensed or omitted from this report as is permitted by the SEC's rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures provided herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022 (the "Fiscal 2022 10-K"). Basis of Consolidation These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements present the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Additionally, as discussed in Note 8, the Company completed the sale of its Club Monaco business at the end of its first quarter of Fiscal 2022 (as defined below) on June 26, 2021. As a result, assets and liabilities related to the Club Monaco business were deconsolidated from the consolidated statement of financial position effective June 26, 2021, with Club Monaco's operating results included in the consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows through the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Financial statements issued prior to this transaction were not affected. 8 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fiscal Periods The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday immediately before or after March 31. As such, fiscal year 2023 will end on April 1, 2023 and will be a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2023"). Fiscal year 2022 ended on April 2, 2022 and was a 53-week period ("Fiscal 2022"). The third quarter of Fiscal 2023 ended on December 31, 2022 and was a 13-week period. The third quarter of Fiscal 2022 ended on December 25, 2021 and was also a 13-week period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt, customer returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; and reserves for restructuring activity, among others. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation . Seasonality of Business The Company's business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in its second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in its second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting its retail business and the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in its business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of the Company's future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns. Accordingly, the Company's operating results and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results and cash flows that may be expected for the full Fiscal 2023.
COVID-19 Pandemic Beginning in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year ended March 28, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"), a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which the Company operates, resulting in adverse economic conditions and widespread business disruptions. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced varying degrees of business disruptions since its beginning, including periods of closure of its stores and corporate-related facilities, as have the Company's wholesale customers, licensing partners, and suppliers. Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than the widespread significant disruptions experienced during the Company's fiscal year ended March 27, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"), and have since extended into Fiscal 2023, most notably in Asia where approximately 50% of the Company's stores in China experienced closures for a significant portion of the first quarter, followed by sporadic closures during the second quarter impacting approximately 35% of the Company's mainland stores. Further, throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of the Company's stores that were able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, as well as reduced staffing, with traffic remaining challenged. Most recently, more than 90% of the Company's mainland China stores were impacted during the third quarter by some form of closure, restricted operating hours, or reduced staffing due to higher levels of infection rates
9 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) following China's relaxation of its zero-COVID policy. However, the Company's digital commerce operations have grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to its investments and enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences.
The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact the Company's distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory closures, labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for both the purchase and transportation of such inventory. Despite the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains volatile and continues to evolve, with resurgences and outbreaks occurring in various parts of the world, including those resulting from variants of the virus. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to impact its business operations or the overall global economy. The Company will continue to assess its operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations. 3.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue. Revenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's own retail stores and shop-within-shop locations, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at the point of sale.
Gift cards purchased by customers are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed for products sold by the Company's retail business, at which point revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as "breakage") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions. Revenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their own sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements, may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum
10 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is generally recognized as revenue ratably over the respective contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to its trademarks.
As of December 31, 2022, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as revenue during future periods were as follows: Contractually-Guaranteed Minimum Royalties (a) (millions) Remainder of Fiscal 2023 $ 14.5   Fiscal 2024 98.9   Fiscal 2025 62.8   Fiscal 2026 44.0   Fiscal 2027 40.7   Fiscal 2028 and thereafter 11.3   Total $ 272.2   (a) Amounts presented do not contemplate potential contract renewals or royalties earned in excess of the contractually-guaranteed minimums.

The Company's deferred income balances were $ 22.0
million and $ 16.6
million as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the deferred income balance as of December 31, 2022 is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. Shipping and Handling Costs Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Costs of preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges ("handling costs"), are also included in SG&A expenses. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue.
A summary of shipping and handling costs for the fiscal periods presented is as follows:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Shipping costs $ 25.7   $ 24.1   $ 60.7   $ 52.9   Handling costs 51.5   43.4   128.2   113.6   Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units ("RSUs"), stock options, and any other potentially dilutive instruments, only for the periods in which such effects are dilutive. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share as follows:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Basic shares 66.5   73.2   68.2   73.7   Dilutive effect of RSUs and stock options 1.1   1.1   1.2   1.3   Diluted shares 67.6   74.3   69.4   75.0   All earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers.
The Company has outstanding performance-based RSUs, which are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price greater than the average market price of such common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, there were
0.3
million and
0.4
million, respectively, of additional shares issuable contingent upon vesting of performance-based RSUs that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations. 12 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Accounts Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy certain defined credit criteria. Payment is generally due within
30 to 120 days
and does not involve a significant financing component. Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the " Revenue Recognition " section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts. A rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances is presented as follows:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Beginning reserve balance $ 166.8   $ 184.8   $ 180.7   $ 173.7   Amount charged against revenue to increase reserve 96.6   101.1   298.8   289.8   Amount credited against customer accounts to decrease reserve ( 114.2 ) ( 106.0 ) ( 316.9 ) ( 283.2 ) Foreign currency translation 7.5   ( 4.3 ) ( 5.9 ) ( 4.7 ) Ending reserve balance $ 156.7   $ 175.6   $ 156.7   $ 175.6   An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of accounts receivable aging, assessments of collectability based on evaluation of historical trends, the financial condition of the Company's customers and their ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and evaluation of the impact of current and forecasted economic and market conditions over the related asset's contractual life, among other factors. A rollforward of the activity in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is presented as follows:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Beginning reserve balance $ 27.7   $ 37.9   $ 34.0   $ 40.1   Amount recorded to expense to increase (decrease) reserve (a) ( 0.4 ) ( 1.8 ) 0.2   ( 2.7 ) Amount written-off against customer accounts to decrease reserve ( 0.6 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 5.5 ) ( 1.8 ) Foreign currency translation 1.0   ( 0.7 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 0.7 ) Ending reserve balance $ 27.7   $ 34.9   $ 27.7   $ 34.9   (a) Amounts recorded to bad debt expense are included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, the Company has
three
key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2022, the Company's sales to its
three
largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately
16 % of total net revenues. Substantially all of the Company's sales to its
three
largest wholesale customers related to its North America segment. As of December 31, 2022, these
three
key wholesale customers accounted for approximately
29 % of total gross accounts receivable. 13 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that is to be sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
Inventory held by the Company totaled $ 1.238
billion, $ 977.3
million, and $ 929.1
million as of December 31, 2022, April 2, 2022, and December 25, 2021, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively. Each derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to evaluate how changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis. Given its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company's policy is to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination, these arrangements allow the Company to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments. The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities for its forward foreign exchange contracts and within cash flows from investing activities for its cross-currency swap contracts, both as discussed below. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold. If a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the accumulated amount is immediately recognized within other income (expense), net. 14 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment. Undesignated Hedges The Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and exposures. Changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments. Refer to Note 3 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for a summary of all of the Company's significant accounting policies. 4.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2022-04, "Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations" ("ASU 2022-04"). ASU 2022-04 requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the purchase of goods and services, along with the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of each period and an annual rollforward of such obligations. This standard does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. ASU 2022-04 is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending March 30, 2024 ("Fiscal 2024") and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods in which a balance sheet is presented. The annual rollforward disclosure is not required to be made until its fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 ("Fiscal 2025") and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2022-04 will not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, "Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting" along with certain other ASUs that were subsequently issued to clarify and modify certain of its provisions (collectively "ASU 2020-04"). ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for the application of U.S. GAAP, if certain criteria are met, to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other arrangements that are expected to be impacted by the global transition away from certain reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates, towards new reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The guidance in ASU 2020-04 was effective upon issuance and, once adopted, may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships through December 31, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, if adopted, and currently does not expect that it would be material. 15 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5.     Property and Equipment Property and equipment, net consists of the following: December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022   (millions) Land and improvements $ 15.3   $ 15.3   Buildings and improvements 470.3   480.4   Furniture and fixtures 598.4   589.6   Machinery and equipment 381.7   375.7   Capitalized software 544.9   532.1   Leasehold improvements 1,206.6   1,170.1   Construction in progress 54.3   55.4   3,271.5   3,218.6   Less: accumulated depreciation ( 2,324.0 ) ( 2,249.1 ) Property and equipment, net $ 947.5   $ 969.5   Property and equipment, net includes finance lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, which are reflected in the table above based on their nature.

impairment charges were recorded during either of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or December 25, 2021. During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges of $ 0.2
million and $ 19.3
million, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets in connection with its restructuring plans (see Note 8). See Note 11 for further discussion of these impairment charges.
8.     Restructuring and Other Charges, Net A description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is provided below. Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan The Company has undertaken efforts to realign its resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The key areas of the Company's initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of its: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across its corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio. In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan") to reduce its global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of its store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company made the decision to close its Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, the Company announced the planned transition of its Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with its long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with its third initiative. Specifically, the Company entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. This agreement created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating its core brands in the marketplace, reducing its direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.
Later, on February 3, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional actions related to its real estate initiative. Specifically, the Company is in the process of further rightsizing and consolidating its global corporate offices to better align with its organizational profile and new ways of working. The Company also has closed, and may continue to close, certain of its stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, the Company further consolidated its North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience. Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with its brand portfolio initiative, the Company sold its former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P. ("Regent"), a global private equity firm, with
no
resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to the Company, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined revenue thresholds over a
five-year
period. Accordingly, the Company has realized amounts related to the receipt of such contingent consideration (as discussed further below) and additional amounts may be realized in the future. Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, the Company provided Regent with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional area.
Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were substantially completed by the end Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. The Company expects total charges of up to $ 300
million to be incurred in connection with this plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $ 180
million and non-cash charges of approximately $ 120
million. 18 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan during the fiscal periods presented, as well as the cumulative charges recorded since its inception (inclusive of immaterial other restructuring-related charges previously recorded during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021), is as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Cumulative Charges   (millions) Cash-related restructuring charges: Severance and benefit costs (reversals) $ —   $ —   $ —   $ ( 3.9 ) $ 138.5   Other cash charges 0.8   1.9   2.9   6.3   25.5   Total cash-related restructuring charges 0.8   1.9   2.9   2.4   164.0   Non-cash charges: Impairment of assets (see Note 7) —   —   0.2   19.3   90.9   Inventory-related charges (a) —   —   —   —   8.3   Accelerated stock-based compensation expense (b) —   —   —   2.0   2.0   Other non-cash charges —   —   3.3   —   3.3   Total non-cash charges —   —   3.5   21.3   104.5   Total charges $ 0.8   $ 1.9   $ 6.4   $ 23.7   $ 268.5     (a) Inventory-related charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. (b) Accelerated stock-based compensation expense, which was recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations, related to vesting provisions associated with certain separation agreements. In addition to the charges summarized in the table above, the Company recognized $ 3.1
million and $ 0.9
million of income within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations during the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2022, respectively, primarily related to a certain revenue share clause in its agreement with Regent that entitled it to receive a portion of the sales generated by the Club Monaco business during a four-month business transition period. The Company donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in a related offsetting $ 4.0
million donation expense recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. Subsequently, during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company recognized an additional $ 3.5
million of income within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations related to consideration received from Regent as a result of the Club Monaco business exceeding certain previously defined revenue thresholds over a specified time period.
A summary of current period activity in the restructuring reserve related to the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan is as follows: Severance and Benefit Costs Other Cash Charges Total (millions) Balance at April 2, 2022 $ 30.6   $ 0.1   $ 30.7   Additions charged to expense —   2.9   2.9   Cash payments applied against reserve ( 15.8 ) ( 3.0 ) ( 18.8 ) Non-cash adjustments ( 0.4 ) —   ( 0.4 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 14.4   $ —   $ 14.4   19 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other Charges The Company recorded other charges of $ 7.0
million and $ 17.6
million during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 1.4
million and $ 7.3
million during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 25, 2021, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. 9.     Income Taxes Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") into law. The IRA enacted a
15 % corporate minimum tax effective (subject to certain thresholds being met) that will be applicable to the Company beginning in its Fiscal 2024, a
1 % excise tax on share repurchases made after December 31, 2022, and created and extended certain tax-related energy incentives. The Company does not currently expect that the tax-related provisions of the IRA will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Effective Tax Rate The Company's effective tax rate, which is calculated by dividing each fiscal period's income tax benefit (provision) by pretax income (loss), was
22.8 % and
23.7 % during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and
21.4 % and
20.6 % during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 25, 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
21 % primarily due to state taxes and the unfavorable impact of certain audit-related adjustments, partially offset by the favorable tax impact of earnings generated in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and favorable return to provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2021 was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
21 % primarily due to state taxes, partially offset by the favorable impact of certain permanent adjustments. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 25, 2021 was slightly lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
21 % primarily due to the favorable tax impact of earnings generated in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. Uncertain Income Tax Benefits The Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax benefit (provision). The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $ 97.4
million and $ 91.9
million as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively, and was included within the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate was $ 62.4
million and $ 60.1
million as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Future Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the Company's current estimate to change materially in the future. The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 30, 2013. 20 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 10.     Debt Debt consists of the following: December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 (millions) $400 million 3.750% Senior Notes (a) $ 398.2   $ 397.7   $500 million 1.700% Senior Notes (b) —   499.8   $750 million 2.950% Senior Notes (c) 739.8   738.8   Total debt 1,138.0   1,636.3   Less: current portion of long-term debt —   499.8   Total long-term debt $ 1,138.0   $ 1,136.5     (a) The carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $ 1.8

million and $ 11.2
million as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Senior Notes In August 2018, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $ 400
million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due
September 15, 2025 , which bear interest at a fixed rate of
3.750 %, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). The 3.750% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to
99.521 % of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $ 300
million principal amount of
2.125 % unsecured senior notes that matured
September 26, 2018 . In June 2020, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $ 500
million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on
June 15, 2022
with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of
1.700 %, payable semi-annually (the "1.700% Senior Notes"), and $ 750
million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due
June 15, 2030 , which bear interest at a fixed rate of
2.950 %, payable semi-annually (the "2.950% Senior Notes"). The 1.700% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes were issued at prices equal to
99.880 % and
98.995 % of their principal amounts, respectively. The proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of $ 475
million previously outstanding under the Company's Global Credit Facility (as defined below) on June 3, 2020 and repayment of its previously outstanding $ 300
million principal amount of
2.625 % unsecured senior notes that matured
August 18, 2020 . The Company has the option to redeem the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"), in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i)
100 % of the principal amount of the series of Senior Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the "Indenture").
The Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. 21 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Commercial Paper The Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $ 500
million of unsecured commercial paper notes through private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the "Commercial Paper Program"). Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility (as defined below). Accordingly, the Company does not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $ 500
million. Commercial Paper Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but cannot exceed
397
days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally in seniority with the Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of both December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. Revolving Credit Facilities Global Credit Facility
In August 2019, the Company replaced its then existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $ 500
million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through
August 12, 2024
(the "Global Credit Facility") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the previous facility. The Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $ 1
billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility. Since August 2019, the Company entered into several amendments of its Global Credit Facility, including one amendment that temporarily eased certain preexisting requirements and imposed certain new restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (all of which have since been lifted), and other amendments related to the cessation of LIBOR. Refer to Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for additional discussion regarding such amendments.
As of both December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the Global Credit Facility. However, the Company was contingently liable for $ 8.8
million
and $ 9.5
million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the "leverage ratio") of no greater than
4.25
as of the date of measurement for the
four
most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related costs.
As of December 31, 2022, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility. Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities Certain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase in China and South Korea (the "Pan-Asia Credit Facilities"). Additionally, the Company's Japan and China subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft facilities with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and HSBC Bank Company Limited, respectively, (the "Pan-Asia Overdraft Facilities"). The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and the Pan-Asia Overdraft Facilities (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities") are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the respective banks, subject to availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants. 22 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the Company's Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities by country is as follows: • China Credit Facility
— provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to
100
million Chinese Renminbi (approximately $ 14
million) through
April 3, 2023 , which is also able to be used to support bank guarantees. • South Korea Credit Facility
— provides Ralph Lauren (Korea) Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to
30
billion South Korean Won (approximately $ 23
million) through
October 27, 2023 . • Japan Overdraft Facility
— provides Ralph Lauren Corporation Japan with an overdraft amount of up to
5
billion Japanese Yen (approximately $ 37
million) through
April 28, 2023 .
• China Overdraft Facility
— provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with an overdraft amount of up to
100
million Chinese Renminbi (approximately $ 14
million) through
June 17, 2023 . As of both December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities. Refer to Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for additional discussion of the terms and conditions of the Company's debt and credit facilities. 11.     Fair Value Measurements U.S. GAAP prescribes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: • Level 1  — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2  — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable. • Level 3  — inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value measurement. The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components: December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022   (millions) Derivative assets (a) $ 56.3   $ 32.4   Derivative liabilities (a) 2.4   18.3   (a) Based on Level 2 measurements. The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.
23 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) To the extent the Company invests in commercial paper, such investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value based on Level 1 measurements. The Company's debt instruments are recorded at their amortized cost in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their amortized cost carrying values. The following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:   December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022   Carrying Value (a) Fair Value (b) Carrying Value (a) Fair Value (b)   (millions) $400 million 3.750% Senior Notes $ 398.2   $ 389.5   $ 397.7   $ 407.9   $500 million 1.700% Senior Notes —   N/A 499.8   500.5   $750 million 2.950% Senior Notes 739.8   646.5   738.8   721.0     (a) See Note 10 for discussion of the carrying values of the Company's senior notes. (b) Based on Level 2 measurements. Unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity. Non-financial Assets and Liabilities The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their amortized or depreciated cost in its consolidated balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows. No
impairment charges were recorded during either of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or December 25, 2021. During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable.
24 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes impairment charges recorded by the Company during the fiscal periods presented to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Long-Lived Asset Category Total Impairments Fair Value

No
impairment charges associated with goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded during either of the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or December 25, 2021. In Fiscal 2023, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. In performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the Company also considered the results of its most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.
12.     Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, based on its assessment thereof, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding derivative instruments recorded on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022:   Notional Amounts Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Instrument (a) December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022       Balance Sheet Line (b) Fair Value Balance Sheet Line (b) Fair Value Balance Sheet Line (b) Fair Value Balance Sheet Line (b) Fair Value   (millions) Designated Hedges : FC — Cash flow hedges $ 257.7   $ 236.5   PP $ 5.8   PP $ 6.6   AE $ 0.2   $ —   Net investment hedges (c) 700.0   700.0   ONCA 50.0   ONCA 23.7   —   ONCL 18.1   Total Designated Hedges 957.7   936.5   55.8   30.3   0.2   18.1   Undesignated Hedges : FC — Undesignated hedges (d) 231.3   225.0   PP 0.5   PP 2.1   AE 2.2   AE 0.2   Total Hedges $ 1,189.0   $ 1,161.5   $ 56.3   $ 32.4   $ 2.4   $ 18.3   (a) FC = Forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 25 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (b) PP = Prepaid expenses and other current assets; AE = Accrued expenses and other current liabilities; ONCA = Other non-current assets; ONCL = Other non-current liabilities. (c) Includes cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in certain foreign operations. (d) Relates to third-party and intercompany foreign currency-denominated exposures and balances. The Company presents the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting arrangements. However, if the Company were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of all of its derivative instruments on a net basis in accordance with the terms of each of its master netting arrangements, spread across
nine
separate counterparties, the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022 would be adjusted from the current gross presentation as detailed in the following table: December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Gross Amounts Presented in the Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements Net Amount Gross Amounts Presented in the Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements Net Amount (millions) Derivative assets $ 56.3   $ ( 2.4 ) $ 53.9   $ 32.4   $ ( 0.2 ) $ 32.2   Derivative liabilities 2.4   ( 2.4 ) —   18.3   ( 0.2 ) 18.1   The Company's master netting arrangements do not require cash collateral to be pledged by the Company or its counterparties. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's master netting arrangements. The following tables summarize the pretax impact of gains and losses from the Company's designated derivative instruments on its consolidated financial statements for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021:   Gains (Losses) Recognized in OCI   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Designated Hedges: FC — Cash flow hedges $ ( 6.0 ) $ 1.7   $ 22.5   $ 1.9   Net investment hedges — effective portion ( 53.4 ) 24.3   22.3   29.5   Net investment hedges — portion excluded from assessment of hedge effectiveness 10.7   ( 0.7 ) 22.1   11.1   Total Designated Hedges $ ( 48.7 ) $ 25.3   $ 66.9   $ 42.5     Location and Amount of Gains (Losses) from Cash Flow Hedges Reclassified from AOCI to Earnings   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold   (millions) Total amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations in which the effects of related cash flow hedges are recorded

As of December 31, 2022, it is estimated that $ 17.3
million of pretax net gains on both outstanding and matured derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges deferred in AOCI will be recognized in earnings over the next twelve months. Amounts ultimately recognized in earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative instruments are settled. The following table summarizes the pretax impact of gains and losses from the Company's undesignated derivative instruments on its consolidated financial statements for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021:   Gains (Losses) Recognized in Earnings Location of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Earnings   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions)   Undesignated Hedges: FC — Undesignated hedges $ ( 9.4 ) $ 4.1   $ 15.2   $ 4.6   Other income (expense), net Total Undesignated Hedges $ ( 9.4 ) $ 4.1   $ 15.2   $ 4.6   Risk Management Strategies Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of
two months
to
one year
to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure. Cross-Currency Swap Contracts The Company periodically designates pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of the Company's senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed-rate Euro-denominated obligations. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments. 27 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Investments The Company's short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022 were $ 131.4
million and $ 734.6
million, respectively, and consisted of time deposits. No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal periods presented.
Refer to Note 3 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its investments. 13.     Commitments and Contingencies The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, leases, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into certain guarantees or other agreements that provide general indemnifications. The Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material indemnification payments.
14.     Equity Common Stock Repurchase Program Repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions, as well as other potential factors such as the temporary restrictions previously in place under the Company's Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company temporarily suspended its common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position. However, the Company resumed activities under its Class A common stock repurchase program during the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 as restrictions under its Global Credit Facility were lifted (see Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K) and overall business and market conditions have improved since the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged. A summary of the Company's repurchases of Class A common stock under its common stock repurchase program is as follows: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (millions) Cost of shares repurchased $ 411.8   $ 300.0   Number of shares repurchased 4.4   2.5   On February 2, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company's existing common stock repurchase program that allows it to repurchase up to an additional $ 1.500
billion of its Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining availability under the Company's Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $ 1.217
billion. As discussed in Note 9, as a result of the IRA's enactment into law, the Company will be subject to a
1 % excise tax on share repurchases made after December 31, 2022. 28 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In addition, during each of the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021,
0.3
million shares of the Company's Class A common stock, at a cost of $ 34.0
million and $ 40.4
million, respectively, were surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under its long-term stock incentive plans. Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost and held in treasury for future use. Dividends Except as discussed below, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock since 2003. In response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 the Company temporarily suspended its quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of its quarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $ 0.6875
per share.
On May 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from $ 0.6875
to $ 0.75
per share. The third quarter Fiscal 2023 dividend of $ 0.75
per share was declared on
December 16, 2022 , was payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on
December 30, 2022 , and was paid on
January 13, 2023 . The Company intends to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of its common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions. 15.     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table presents OCI activity, net of tax, accumulated in equity: Foreign Currency Translation Gains (Losses) (a) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges (b) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Defined Benefit Plans (c) Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (millions) Balance at April 2, 2022 $ ( 189.7 ) $ 9.0   $ 0.4   $ ( 180.3 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: OCI before reclassifications ( 28.8 ) 19.4   —   ( 9.4 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings —   ( 13.0 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 13.1 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 28.8 ) 6.4   ( 0.1 ) ( 22.5 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 218.5 ) $ 15.4   $ 0.3   $ ( 202.8 ) Balance at March 27, 2021 $ ( 123.2 ) $ 4.6   $ ( 2.2 ) $ ( 120.8 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: OCI before reclassifications ( 29.8 ) 1.6   0.1   ( 28.1 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings —   ( 1.2 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 1.3 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 29.8 ) 0.4   —   ( 29.4 ) Balance at December 25, 2021 $ ( 153.0 ) $ 5.0   $ ( 2.2 ) $ ( 150.2 ) (a) OCI before reclassifications to earnings related to foreign currency translation gains (losses) includes income tax provisions of $ 15.4

However, any prior awards granted under either the Company's 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan remain subject to the terms of those plans, as applicable. Any awards that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes are available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. Refer to Note 18 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for a detailed description of the Company's stock-based compensation awards, including information related to vesting terms, service, performance, and market conditions and payout percentages. Impact on Results A summary of total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits recognized during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 is as follows:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Compensation expense $ 19.2   $ 22.0   $ 59.9   $ 62.6   (a) Income tax benefit ( 3.3 ) ( 3.3 ) ( 9.9 ) ( 9.9 )   (a) Includes $ 2.0
million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8). All other stock-based compensation expense was recorded within SG&A expenses. The Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the first half of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods. 30 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Service-based RSUs The fair values of service-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue to the holder while outstanding and unvested. The weighted-average grant date fair values of service-based RSU awards granted were $ 92.07
and $ 117.56
per share during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. A summary of service-based RSU activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Number of
Service-based RSUs   (thousands) Unvested at April 2, 2022 1,566   Granted 668   Vested ( 564 ) Forfeited ( 45 ) Unvested at December 31, 2022 1,625   Performance-based RSUs The fair values of the Company's performance-based RSUs granted to its senior executives and other key employees are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue to the holder while outstanding and unvested. The weighted-average grant date fair values of performance-based RSU awards granted were $ 92.45
and $ 117.79
per share during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.
Market-based RSUs The Company grants market-based RSUs, which are based on total shareholder return ("TSR") performance, to its senior executives and other key employees. The Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The weighted-average grant date fair values of market-based RSUs granted were $ 124.62
and $ 146.46
per share during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows:   Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Expected volatility 49.9   % 46.8   % Expected dividend yield 3.0   % 2.2   % Risk-free interest rate 3.1   % 0.4   % 31 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of performance-based RSU activity including TSR awards during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:   Number of Performance-based RSUs   (thousands) Unvested at April 2, 2022 542   Granted 261   Change due to performance and/or market condition achievement ( 58 ) Vested ( 269 ) Forfeited ( 3 ) Unvested at December 31, 2022 473   17.     Segment Information The Company has
three
reportable segments based on its business activities and organization: • North America
— The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, and its digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores. • Europe
— The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
• Asia
— The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.

No operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances. In addition, prior to its disposition at the end of the Company's first quarter of Fiscal 2022, other non-reportable segments also included sales of Club Monaco branded products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and its licensing alliances in Asia. Refer to Note 8 for additional discussion regarding the disposition of the Company's former Club Monaco business, as well as the transition of its Chaps business to a fully licensed business model. The Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K. Sales and transfers between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment's performance is evaluated based upon net revenues and operating income before restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time items, if any. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions, most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be
32 RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including corporate advertising and marketing expenses, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from corporate-level activities and projects.

Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home. We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: • North America
— Our North America segment, representing approximately 48% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
• Europe
— Our Europe segment, representing approximately 28% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
• Asia
— Our Asia segment, representing approximately 21% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops. No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 3% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances. In addition, prior to its disposition at the end of our first quarter of Fiscal 2022, our other non-reportable segments also included sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Asia. Refer to " Recent Developments " for additional discussion regarding the disposition of our former Club Monaco business, as well as the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model. Approximately 51% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure. Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating
39 income (loss), and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns. Accordingly, our operating results and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results and cash flows that may be expected for the full Fiscal 2023. Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic Beginning in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 28, 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate, resulting in adverse economic conditions and widespread business disruptions. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions since its beginning, including periods of closure of our stores and corporate-related facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, and suppliers. Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than the widespread significant disruptions experienced during our fiscal year ended March 27, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"), and have since extended into Fiscal 2023, most notably in Asia where approximately 50% of our stores in China experienced closures for a significant portion of the first quarter, followed by sporadic closures during the second quarter impacting approximately 35% of our mainland stores. Further, throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of our stores that were able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, as well as reduced staffing, with traffic remaining challenged. Most recently, more than 90% of our mainland China stores were impacted during the third quarter by some form of closure, restricted operating hours, or reduced staffing due to higher levels of infection rates following China's relaxation of its zero-COVID policy. However, our digital commerce operations have grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to our investments and enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences.
The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact our distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory closures, labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for both the purchase and transportation of such inventory. Despite the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains volatile and continues to evolve, with resurgences and outbreaks occurring in various parts of the world, including those resulting from variants of the virus. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to impact our business operations or the overall global economy. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations. See Item 1A  —  " Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business " in the Fiscal 2022 10-K for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan We have undertaken efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The key initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across our corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio. In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan") to reduce our global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with our third initiative. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and
40 womenswear. The products are being sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into additional channels and markets globally. This agreement created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our core brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand. Later, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we are in the process of further rightsizing and consolidating our global corporate offices to better align with our organizational profile and new ways of working. We also have closed, and may continue to close, certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we further consolidated our North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience. Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we sold our former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P. ("Regent"), a global private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to us, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, we have realized amounts related to the receipt of such contingent consideration and additional amounts may be realized in the future. Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, we provided Regent with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional area.
In connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, we have recorded cumulative pre-tax charges of $268.5 million, of which $6.4 million and $23.7 million were recorded during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. We expect total charges of up to $300 million to be incurred in connection with this plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $180 million and non-cash charges of approximately $120 million. Actions associated with this plan are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200 million, a portion of which is being reinvested back into the business. See Note 8 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.
Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many different factors. Changes in economic conditions, most notably inflationary pressures (including increases in the cost of raw materials, transportation, and salaries & benefits), rising interest rates, significant foreign currency volatility, and concerns of a potential recession, continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment. In response to such pressures, as well as in an effort to reduce elevated inventory levels, many retailers have become increasingly more promotional in an attempt to offset traffic declines and increase conversion. Certain other worldwide events and factors, such as international trade relations, new legislation and regulations, taxation or monetary policy changes, and political and civil unrest, among other factors, have also adversely impacted the global economy. The continuation of these trends could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. The global economy has also been negatively impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war. Several countries, including the U.S., have imposed significant economic sanctions against Russia, including export controls and other trade restrictions with Russian entities. Various companies, including Ralph Lauren, have also voluntarily elected to suspend operations in Russia in protest of the conflict. While the suspension of our operations in Russia have not resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, our business has been impacted by the broader macroeconomic implications resulting from the war, including unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increases in energy prices, food shortages, and volatility in financial markets, among other factors, which have adversely impacted consumer sentiment and confidence, particularly in Eastern Europe. It is not clear at this time how long the conflict will endure, or if it will escalate further with additional countries declaring war against each other, which could further compound the adverse impact to the global economy. The global economy also continues to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, although to a much lesser extent than what was experienced during the first year of the pandemic. As discussed in " Recent Developments ," certain geographic regions, particularly in Asia, continue to be impacted by temporary store closures, restricted operating hours, and/or reduced staffing due to elevated infection levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly disrupted distribution, logistic, and supply chain operations globally, including temporary factory closures, labor shortages, vessel, container, and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed timing of
41 inventory receipts, and have resulted in increased costs for both the purchase and transportation of such inventory. Despite the development of COVID-19 vaccines, it is not clear at this time how much longer and to what extent the pandemic will last. We have implemented various strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and marketing across channels and driving a more efficient operating model. Our strategy for mitigating inflationary pressures includes numerous levers, including our commitment to driving average unit retail growth, leveraging our diversified supply chain and strong supplier relationships, elevating our product sustainability efforts, and leveraging our in-house quality control to reduce time and cost from the manufacturing process, among other efforts. We have also taken earlier receipts of inventory and strategically utilize faster means of transportation when necessary to maximize full-price selling windows. While we remain agile and mindful of the increasing competitive promotional environment, we plan to continue driving our broader long-term strategy of brand elevation, which includes multiple levers to continue driving average unit retail growth and brand equity. We will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and will evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost management opportunities to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A — " Risk Factors " in our Fiscal 2022 10-K. Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we reported net revenues of $1.832 billion, net income of $216.5 million, and net income per diluted share of $3.20, as compared to net revenues of $1.815 billion, net income of $217.7 million, and net income per diluted share of $2.93 during the three months ended December 25, 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we reported net revenues of $4.903 billion, net income of $490.4 million, and net income per diluted share of $7.07, as compared to net revenues of $4.696 billion, net income of $575.7 million, and net income per diluted share of $7.68 during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other benefits (charges), as well as the impacts of the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 and the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, as discussed further below. We also continue to experience varying degrees of business disruptions resulting from the current macroeconomic environment, including ongoing global supply chain and other inflationary pressures, foreign currency volatility, the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19-related disruptions.     Our operating performance for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 reflected revenue increases of 0.9% and 4.4%, respectively, on a reported basis and 7.2% and 10.9%, respectively, on a constant currency basis, as defined within " Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition "
below. The increases in net revenues during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 reflected growth across all of our reportable segments. Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined by 100 basis points to 65.0% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and by 220 basis points to 65.6% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the current fiscal year periods as compared to the prior fiscal year periods, partially offset by improved pricing.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022 declined by 90 basis points to 49.2% and increased by 70 basis points to 51.6% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by a normalized quarterly cadence of marketing investments. Net income decreased by $1.2 million to $216.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 25, 2021, primarily due to a $7.0 million decline in our operating income and a $4.4 million increase in our income tax provision, largely offset by a $10.2 million decline in non-operating expense, net. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.27 to $3.20 per share during the three months ended December 31, 2022 driven by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Net income decreased by $85.3 million to $490.4 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended December 25, 2021, primarily due to a $97.6 million decline in our operating income, partially offset by a $15.0 million decline in non-operating expense, net. Net income per
42 diluted share decreased by $0.61 to $7.07 per share during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 driven by the lower level of net income, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Our operating results during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $11.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $9.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, and $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $31.3 million and $15.2 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $24.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, and $11.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, respectively. Financial Condition and Liquidity We ended the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 in a net cash and short-term investments position (calculated as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments, less total debt) of $559.5 million, as compared to $962.1 million as of the end of Fiscal 2022. The decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $445.8 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $155.9 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $148.8 million, as well as the unfavorable effect of exchange rate changes on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $23.2 million, partially offset by operating cash flows of $397.0 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $397.0 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $821.7 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as well as a decrease in net income before non-cash charges. Our equity decreased to $2.468 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to $2.536 billion as of April 2, 2022 due to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements. Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of our operating results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 has been affected by certain events, including: • pretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring activities, as well as certain other benefits (charges), as summarized below (references to "Notes" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (millions) Restructuring and other charges, net (see Note 8) $ (7.8) $ (0.2) $ (20.3) $ (8.6) Non-routine inventory benefits (charges) (a) (4.0) —  (13.2) 11.5  Impairment of assets (see Note 7) —  —  (0.2) (19.3) Non-routine bad debt expense reversals (b) —  0.1  2.4  1.2  Total charges $ (11.8) $ (0.1) $ (31.3) $ (15.2)   (a) Non-routine inventory benefits (charges) are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. The charges recorded during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 were primarily attributable to inventory adjustments due to delays in U.S. customs shipment reviews and approvals. The net charges recorded during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to the Russia-Ukraine war (approximately $11 million) and delays in U.S. customs shipment reviews and approvals (approximately $4 million), partially offset by reversals of amounts previously recognized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately $2 million). The benefits recorded during the nine-month periods ended December 25, 2021 related to reversals of amounts previously recognized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. 43 (b) Non-routine bad debt expense reversals are recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The reversals recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 related to charges previously recognized in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war. The reversals recorded during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 25, 2021 related to charges previously recognized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. • the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. We did not recognize any net revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 in connection with our former Club Monaco business, whereas in comparison we recognized net revenues of approximately $34 million during the comparable prior fiscal year period, all of which was recorded during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022; • the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, which resulted in an overall decline in net revenues of approximately $15 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period; and • other varying degrees of COVID-19 business disruptions during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. Because we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the "Results of Operations" section where applicable. Our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are calculated on a constant currency basis.
Our "Results of Operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. 44 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 25, 2021

Net revenues for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's net revenues from the comparable prior fiscal year period, are provided below:   Three Months Ended $ Change Foreign Exchange Impact $ Change % Change   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 As Reported Constant Currency As Reported Constant Currency   (millions)   Net Revenues: North America $ 937.6  $ 928.7  $ 8.9  $ (2.5) $ 11.4  1.0  % 1.2  % Europe 469.3  462.9  6.4  (54.8) 61.2  1.4  % 13.2  % Asia 386.2  382.6  3.6  (56.4) 60.0  0.9  % 15.7  % Other non-reportable segments 39.2  41.2  (2.0) —  (2.0) (5.0  %) (5.0  %) Total net revenues $ 1,832.3  $ 1,815.4  $ 16.9  $ (113.7) $ 130.6  0.9  % 7.2  % North America net revenues  — Net revenues increased by $8.9 million, or 1.0%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 25, 2021. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $11.4 million, or 1.2%.
The $8.9 million increase in North America net revenues was driven by: • a $15.1 million increase related to our North America retail business. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $16.9 million, reflecting increases of $14.5 million in comparable store sales and $2.4 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business:   % Change Digital commerce 9  % Brick and mortar (1  %) Total comparable store sales 2  % 46 This increase was partially offset by a $6.2 million decrease related to our North America wholesale business driven by U.S. customs-related inventory receipt delays.
Europe net revenues  — Net revenues increased by $6.4 million, or 1.4%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 25, 2021. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $61.2 million, or 13.2%. The $6.4 million increase in Europe net revenues was driven by: • an $8.5 million increase related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $28.6 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $37.1 million, reflecting increases of $24.1 million in comparable store sales and $13.0 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail business:   % Change Digital commerce 12  % Brick and mortar 11  % Total comparable store sales 11  % This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease related to our Europe wholesale business largely driven by unfavorable foreign currency effects of $26.2 million, partially offset by improved timing of inventory receipts and fulfillment of customer orders. Asia net revenues  — Net revenues increased by $3.6 million, or 0.9%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 25, 2021, despite more than 90% of our mainland China stores experiencing some form of closure, restricted operating hours, or reduced staffing due to higher levels of infection rates following China's relaxation of its zero-COVID policy. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $60.0 million, or 15.7%. The $3.6 million increase in Asia net revenues was driven by: • a $6.3 million increase related to our Asia wholesale business, reflecting increases most notably in Japan and Australia, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3.1 million. This increase was partially offset by: • a $2.7 million decrease related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $53.3 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $50.6 million, reflecting increases of $26.2 million in non-comparable store sales and $24.4 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business:
% Change Digital commerce 21  % Brick and mortar 7  % Total comparable store sales 8  % Gross Profit.     Gross profit decreased by $7.4 million, or 0.6%, to $1.191 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2022, including unfavorable foreign currency effects of $104.5 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined to 65.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 66.0% for the three months ended December 25, 2021. The 100 basis point decrease was primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by improved pricing.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, pricing, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from period to period. 47 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.     SG&A expenses include costs relating to compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses decreased by $8.0 million, or 0.9%, to $900.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, including favorable foreign currency effects of $53.0 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to 49.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 50.1% for the three months ended December 25, 2021. The 90 basis point improvement was largely driven by lower marketing and advertising expenses due to a more normalized quarterly cadence of marketing investments compared to the prior fiscal year period.
The $8.0 million decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 (millions) SG&A expense category: Marketing and advertising expenses $ (11.7) Rent and occupancy expenses (5.6) Compensation-related expenses (5.6) Non-income tax expenses (4.8) Selling-related expenses (4.2) Shipping and handling costs 9.7  Consulting and professional fees 4.6  Staff-related expenses 4.5  Other 5.1  Total decrease in SG&A expenses $ (8.0) Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
During the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, consisting of restructuring-related other cash charges, as well as other charges of $7.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. Additionally, during the three months ended December 25, 2021, we recognized $3.1 million of income primarily related to a certain revenue share clause in our agreement with Regent for the sale of Club Monaco that entitled us to receive a portion of the sales generated by the Club Monaco business during a four-month business transition period.
Operating Income.     Operating income decreased by $7.0 million, or 2.4%, to $282.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency effects of $51.5 million. Additionally, during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $11.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 15.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a 50 basis point decline from the prior fiscal year period. The decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in our gross margin and higher net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by the decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as previously discussed.
48 Operating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes i n each reportable segment's operating margin from the comparable prior fiscal year period, are provided below:   Three Months Ended     December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021     Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin $ Change Margin Change (millions)   (millions)   (millions)   Segment: North America $ 214.9  22.9% $ 229.6  24.7% $ (14.7) (180 bps) Europe 109.6  23.3% 97.1  21.0% 12.5  230 bps Asia 89.8  23.3% 85.6  22.4% 4.2  90 bps Other non-reportable segments 36.9  94.3% 38.5  93.4% (1.6) 90 bps 451.2  450.8  0.4  Unallocated corporate expenses (161.3) (161.5) 0.2  Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net (7.8) (0.2) (7.6) Total operating income $ 282.1  15.4% $ 289.1  15.9% $ (7.0) (50 bps) North America operating margin
declined by 180 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of approximately 170 basis points attributable to our retail business, driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and a decline in our gross margin, and 40 basis points attributable to higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. These declines in operating margin were partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately 30 basis points related to our wholesale business, largely attributable to an increase in our gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Europe operating margin
improved by 230 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of approximately 360 basis points and 180 basis points related to our wholesale and retail businesses, respectively, both largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The improvement in our wholesale business also reflected an increase in our gross margin. These improvements in operating margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of 290 basis points related to foreign currency effects and 20 basis points attributable to higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period.
Asia operating margin
improved by 90 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of approximately 270 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in our gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin also reflected the favorable impacts of approximately 40 basis points attributable to other factors, most notably favorable channel mix. These improvements in operating margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 220 basis points attributable to foreign currency effects. Unallocated corporate expenses
decreased by $0.2 million to $161.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The slight decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due to lower compensation-related expenses of $7.2 million, lower non-income tax expenses of $4.4 million, and lower other expenses of $1.1 million, partially offset by higher marketing and advertising expenses of $7.2 million and higher consulting fees of $5.3 million. Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net
increased by $7.6 million to $7.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as previously discussed above and in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.
Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. During the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we reported non-operating expense, net, of $1.7 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The $10.2 million decrease in non-operating expense, net was driven by: • a $7.2 million increase in interest income, primarily driven by higher interest rates in financial markets;
• a $1.6 million increase in other income, net primarily driven by higher net foreign currency gains during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period; and 49 • a $1.4 million decline in interest expense, primarily driven by the lower average level of outstanding debt during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period resulting from our repayment of the 1.700% Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2022 (see " Financial Condition and Liquidity — Cash Flows "). Income Tax Provision.     The income tax provision represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. The income tax provision and effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $63.9 million and 22.8%, respectively, as compared to $59.5 million and 21.4%, respectively, for the three months ended December 25, 2021. The $4.4 million increase in our income tax provision was primarily driven by our higher pretax income and a 140 basis point increase in our effective tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of certain favorable permanent adjustments taken during the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by favorable return to provision adjustments. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Net Income.     Net income decreased to $216.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $217.7 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021. The $1.2 million decrease in net income was due to our lower operating income and higher income tax provision, largely offset by a decline in non-operating expense, net, all as previously discussed. During the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our operating results included net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $11.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $9.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Net Income per Diluted Share.     Net income per diluted share increased to $3.20 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $2.93 for the three months ended December 25, 2021. The $0.27 per share increase was driven by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2022 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share and $0.01 per share, respectively, as a result of net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed. 50 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 25, 2021

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined to 65.6% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 67.8% for the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The 220 basis point decline was primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by improved pricing.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.     SG&A expenses increased by $138.8 million, or 5.8%, to $2.531 billion for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, including favorable foreign currency effects of $135.3 million.

The $138.8 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 25, 2021 (millions) SG&A expense category: Marketing and advertising expenses $ 36.6  Compensation-related expenses 29.1  Shipping and handling costs 22.4  Staff-related expenses 20.5  Consulting and professional fees 15.4  Selling-related expenses 13.4  Non-income tax expenses (11.4) Other 12.8  Total increase in SG&A expenses $ 138.8  Impairment of Assets.
During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $0.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 53 Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we recorded net restructuring charges and benefits of $6.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, primarily consisting of other cash charges and severance and benefits costs (reversals), as well as other charges of $17.6 million and $7.3 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired.
Additionally, during the
nine-month periods ended
December 31, 2022 and
December 25, 2021, we recognized income of $3.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent in connection with the sale of Club Monaco. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Operating Income.    Operating income decreased by $97.6 million, or 12.8%, to $664.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency effects of $141.5 million. Our operating results during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $31.3 million and $15.2 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 13.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a 270 basis point decline from the prior fiscal year period. The decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in our gross margin and the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, as well as higher net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, all as previously discussed. Operating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the comparable prior fiscal year period, are provided below:   Nine Months Ended     December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021     Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin $ Change Margin Change (millions)   (millions)   (millions)   Segment: North America $ 474.8  20.1% $ 586.5  25.6% $ (111.7) (550 bps) Europe 317.4  23.0% 353.4  26.9% (36.0) (390 bps) Asia 234.2  22.6% 189.4  20.1% 44.8  250 bps Other non-reportable segments (a) 114.1  93.0% 106.2  71.8% 7.9  2,120 bps 1,140.5  1,235.5  (95.0) Unallocated corporate expenses (456.2) (465.3) 9.1  Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net (20.3) (8.6) (11.7) Total operating income $ 664.0  13.5% $ 761.6  16.2% $ (97.6) (270 bps) (a) Reflects the disposition of our Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. North America operating margin
declined by 550 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of approximately 390 basis points and 70 basis points related to our retail and wholesale businesses, respectively, both largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and a decline in our gross margin. The overall decline in operating margin also reflected the unfavorable impact of 90 basis points attributable to higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period.
Europe operating margin
declined by 390 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of 360 basis points attributable to foreign currency effects and approximately 130 basis points related to our retail business, primarily driven by a decline in our gross margin. The overall decline in operating margin also reflected the unfavorable impact of 20 basis points attributable to higher non-routine inventory charges recorded during the nine months ended December 25, 2021 as compared to the current fiscal year period. These declines in operating margin were partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points related to our wholesale business, largely attributable to an increase in our gross margin and a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Asia operating margin
improved by 250 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of approximately 340 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in our gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin also reflected 10 basis points attributable to lower impairment of assets recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as
54 well as approximately 50 basis points attributable to other factors, most notably favorable channel mix. These increases in operating margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 150 basis points attributable to foreign currency effects.
Unallocated corporate expenses
decreased by $9.1 million to $456.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due to lower impairment charges of $17.3 million, lower compensation-related expenses of $12.4 million, lower non-income taxes of $10.9 million, and lower other expenses of $6.0 million, partially offset by higher marketing and advertising expenses of $24.0 million and higher consulting fees of $13.5 million. Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net
increased by $11.7 million to $20.3 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as previously discussed above and in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.
During the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we reported non-operating expense, net of $21.3 million and $36.3 million, respectively. The $15.0 million decrease in non-operating expense, net was driven by: • a $14.4 million increase in interest income, primarily driven by higher interest rates in financial markets; and • a $7.0 million decrease in interest expense, primarily driven by the lower average level of outstanding debt during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period resulting from our repayment of the 1.700% Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2022 (see " Financial Condition and Liquidity — Cash Flows "). These favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in other expense, net of $6.4 million, primarily driven by higher net foreign currency losses during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year period.
Income Tax Provision.     The income tax provision and effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $152.3 million and 23.7%, respectively, compared to $149.6 million and 20.6%, respectively, for the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $2.7 million increase in our income tax provision was driven by a 310 basis point increase in our effective tax rate, partially offset by the decline in our pretax income. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of prior year deferred tax adjustments for certain deferred tax liabilities and the absence of certain favorable permanent adjustments, partially offset by favorable return to provision adjustments. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Net Income.     Net income decreased to $490.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, from $575.7 million for the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $85.3 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the decline in our operating income, partially offset by a decline in non-operating expense, net, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $31.3 million and $15.2 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $24.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively.
Net Income per Diluted Share.     Net income per diluted share decreased to $7.07 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, from $7.68 for the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $0.61 per share decrease was driven by the lower level of net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were also negatively impacted by $0.35 per share and $0.15 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed.
55 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition   The following table presents our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022: December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 $ Change   (millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,566.1  $ 1,863.8  $ (297.7) Short-term investments 131.4  734.6  (603.2) Current portion of long-term debt (a) —  (499.8) 499.8  Long-term debt (a) (1,138.0) (1,136.5) (1.5) Net cash and short-term investments   $ 559.5  $ 962.1  $ (402.6) Equity $ 2,467.8  $ 2,536.0  $ (68.2) (a) See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt. The decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position at December 31, 2022 as compared to April 2, 2022 was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $445.8 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $155.9 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $148.8 million, as well as the unfavorable effect of exchange rate changes on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $23.2 million, partially offset by operating cash flows of $397.0 million. The decrease in our equity was attributable to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements. Cash Flows The following table details our cash flows for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021:   Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 $ Change   (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 397.0  $ 821.7  $ (424.7) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 438.2  (635.8) 1,074.0  Net cash used in financing activities (1,110.5) (458.3) (652.2) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (23.2) (30.2) 7.0  Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (298.5) $ (302.6) $ 4.1  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.     Net cash provided by operating activities was $397.0 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $821.7 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $424.7 million net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as well as the decline in net income before non-cash charges. The net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by: • a net unfavorable change in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely driven by a decrease in our bonus accrual and the timing of cash payments, coupled with an unfavorable change in our dividends payable related to the temporary suspension and subsequent resumption of our quarterly cash dividend program in Fiscal 2022;
56 • a year-over-year increase in our inventory levels largely to support revenue growth, as well as the impact of earlier receipt timing to mitigate ongoing global supply chain delays; and • an unfavorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by stronger performance in our wholesale businesses, as well as timing of cash receipts. These decreases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:
• a favorable change related to our income tax receivables and payables largely driven by the timing of cash receipts and payments, respectively. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.     Net cash provided by investing activities was $438.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $635.8 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $1.074 billion net increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by: • a $1.119 billion increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $599.3 million, as compared to making net purchases of investments of $520.1 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. This increase in cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by:
• a $42.3 million increase in capital expenditures. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we spent $155.9 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $113.6 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to store openings and renovations, as well as enhancements to our information technology systems. Over the course of Fiscal 2023, we expect to spend approximately $240 million to $250 million on capital expenditures primarily related to store opening and renovations, as well as enhancements to our information technology systems. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.     Net cash used in financing activities was $1.111 billion during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $458.3 million during the nine months ended December 25, 2021. The $652.2 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: • a $500.0 million increase in cash used to repay debt. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid our previously outstanding $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 1.700% senior notes that matured June 15, 2022. On a comparative basis, during the nine months ended December 25, 2021, we did not issue or repay any debt; • a $105.4 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we used $411.8 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program (which had been temporarily paused in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic but subsequently resumed during the third quarter of Fiscal 2022), and an additional $34.0 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during the nine months ended December 25, 2021, we used $300.0 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $40.4 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and • a $47.7 million increase in payments of dividends, due to the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend program during Fiscal 2022 after being temporarily suspended at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as discussed in " Dividends " below, as well as an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share. Dividends paid amounted to $148.8 million and $101.1 million during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. 57 Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we generated $397.0 million of net cash flows from our operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.697 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $868.1 million were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings generated on or before December 31, 2017 that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax in connection with U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes. The following table presents the total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2022:   December 31, 2022 Description (a) Total Availability Borrowings Outstanding Remaining Availability   (millions) Global Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program (b) $ 500  $ 9  (c) $ 491  Pan-Asia Credit Facilities 37  —  37  Pan-Asia Overdraft Facilities 51  —  51  (a) As defined in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (b) Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million. (c) Represents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. We believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of December 31, 2022, there were eight financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Pan-Asia Overdraft Facility (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities") are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future. Our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from pandemic
58 diseases and other catastrophic events, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for additional information relating to our credit facilities. Debt and Covenant Compliance In August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). In June 2020, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on June 15, 2022 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the "1.700% Senior Notes"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the "2.950% Senior Notes"). The indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the "Indenture") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.
We have a credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024, which is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the "Global Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility. The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance. Common Stock Repurchase Program Repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions, as well as other potential factors such as the temporary restrictions previously in place under our Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position. However, we resumed activities under our Class A common stock repurchase program during the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 as restrictions under our Global Credit Facility were lifted (see Note 11 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K) and overall business and market conditions have improved since the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged. On February 2, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to an additional $1.500 billion of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $1.217 billion. As discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was signed into law by President Biden in August 2022. Among its various provisions, the IRA imposes a 1% excise tax on share repurchases made after December 31, 2022. See Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase program. 59 Dividends Except as discussed below, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003.
In response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 we temporarily suspended our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $0.6875 per share.
On May 18, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.6875 to $0.75 per share.
We intend to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of our common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions. See Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program. Material Cash Requirements There have been no substantial changes to our material cash requirements as disclosed in our Fiscal 2022 10-K, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business. Refer to the
" Financial Condition and Liquidity — Contractual and Other Obligations "
section of the MD&A in our Fiscal 2022 10-K for detailed disclosure of our material cash requirements as of April 2, 2022. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT As discussed in Note 13 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K and Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of levels and types of risks, including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business we assess such risks and, in accordance with our established policies and procedures, may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate them. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Given our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022. However, we do have in aggregate $57.1 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions held across eight creditworthy financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. Refer to Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments as of December 31, 2022. 60 Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts We enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure. Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses. Cross-Currency Swap Contracts We periodically designate pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign currency exposures and the types of derivative instruments used to hedge those exposures. Investment Risk Management As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.566 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included $131.4 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days. We actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of the Fiscal 2022 10-K. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to the " Critical Accounting Policies " section of the MD&A in our Fiscal 2022 10-K. There have been no significant changes in the application of our critical accounting policies since April 2, 2022. 61 Goodwill Impairment Assessment We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. In performing the assessment, we identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of our reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, we also considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of our qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values, and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk, see " Market Risk Management " presented in Part I, Item 2 — MD&A of this Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference. Item 4.     Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. We carried out an evaluation based on criteria established in the
