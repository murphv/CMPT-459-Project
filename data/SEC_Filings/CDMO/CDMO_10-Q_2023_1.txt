NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 –
Description of Company and Basis
of Presentation
We are a dedicated contract development and manufacturing
organization (“CDMO”) that provides a comprehensive range of services from process development to Current Good Manufacturing
Practices (“CGMP”) clinical and commercial manufacturing of biologics for the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“U.S. GAAP”) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) related
to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for
annual financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022. The unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented herein reflects
all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations
for the periods presented, with such adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments. Results of operations for interim periods
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations for the full fiscal year or any
other interim period.
The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Avid Bioservices, Inc. and its subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions among
the consolidated entities have been eliminated in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, as well
as disclosures of commitments and contingencies in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates and assumptions.
Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Information regarding our significant accounting
policies is contained in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the consolidated financial statements in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognized from services provided under
our customer contracts is disaggregated into manufacturing and process development revenue streams.
Manufacturing revenue
Manufacturing revenue generally represents revenue
from the manufacturing of customer products recognized over time utilizing an input method that compares the cost of cumulative work-in-process
to date to the most current estimates for the entire cost of the performance obligation. Under a manufacturing contract, a quantity of
manufacturing runs are ordered at a specified scale with prescribed dates, where the product is manufactured according to the customer’s
specifications and typically includes only one performance obligation. Each manufacturing run represents a distinct service that is sold
separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The products are manufactured exclusively for a specific customer and have no alternative
use. The customer retains control of its product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications
at its request. Under these agreements, we are entitled to consideration for progress to date that includes an element of profit margin.
7
Process development revenue
Process development revenue generally represents
revenue from services associated with the custom development of a manufacturing process and analytical methods for a customer’s
product. Process development revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method that compares the cost of cumulative work-in-process
to date to the most current estimates for the entire cost of the performance obligation. Under a process development contract, the customer
owns the product details and process, which has no alternative use. These process development projects are customized to each customer
to meet its specifications and typically includes only one performance obligation. Each process represents a distinct service that is
sold separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The customer also retains control of its product as the product is being created
or enhanced by our services and can make changes to its process or specifications upon request. Under these agreements, we are entitled
to consideration for progress to date that includes an element of profit margin.
The following table summarizes our manufacturing
and process development revenue streams (in thousands):

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and
cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer deposits
and deferred revenue). Contract assets are recorded when our right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage
of time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet when our rights become unconditional.
Contract liabilities represent customer deposits and deferred revenue billed and/or received in advance of our fulfillment of performance
obligations. Contract liabilities convert to revenue as we perform our obligations under the contract.
During the three and nine months ended January
31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $ 8.3
million
and $ 35.2
million , respectively, for which the contract liability was recorded in a prior
period.
During the three and nine months ended January
31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $ 6.9
million
and $ 31.7
million , respectively, for which the contract liability was recorded in a prior
period.
The transaction price for services provided under
our customer contracts reflects our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for providing goods
and services to our customers. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate transaction price to each performance
obligation identified in a contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. We generally determine relative standalone selling prices
based on the price observed in the customer contract for each distinct performance obligation. If observable standalone selling prices
are not available, we may estimate the applicable standalone selling price based on the pricing of other comparable services or on a price
that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service.
In determining the transaction price, we also
considered the different sources of variable consideration including, but not limited to, discounts, credits, refunds, price concessions
or other similar items. We have included in the transaction price some or all of an amount of variable consideration, utilizing the most
likely method, only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The actual amount of consideration
ultimately received may differ.
8
In addition, our customer contracts generally
include provisions entitling us to a cancellation or postponement fee when a customer cancels or postpones its commitments prior to our
initiation of services, therefore not utilizing their reserved capacity. The determination of such cancellation and postponement fees
are based on the terms stated in the related customer contract but are generally considered substantive for accounting purposes and create
an enforceable right and obligation due to us when the cancellation or postponement occurs. Accordingly, we recognize such fees, subject
to variable consideration, as revenue upon the cancellation or postponement date utilizing the most likely method.
Management may be required to exercise judgement
in estimating revenue to be recognized. Judgement is required in identifying performance obligations, estimating the transaction price,
estimating the stand-alone selling prices of identified performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, and estimating the
progress towards the satisfaction of performance obligations. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, the estimates will
be adjusted, which will affect revenues in the period that such variances become known.
During the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $ 3 .0
million for changes in estimates for variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved. During the three and
nine months ended January 31, 2022, changes in estimates for variable consideration resulted in a decrease in revenues of $ 1.2
million
and $ 12.4
million , respectively. These changes in estimates for variable consideration can primarily be attributed to a dispute with a
customer, which was recently resolved, over the payment of certain cancellation
fees incurred in fiscal 2022 and due to us under the terms of the contract (Note 8).
We apply the practical expedient available under
ASC 606 that permits us not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length
of one year or less. As of January 31, 2023, we do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts greater than one year.
Costs incurred to obtain a contract are not material.
These costs are generally employee sales commissions, which are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative
expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Restricted Cash
Under the terms of an operating lease related
to one of our facilities (Note 4), we are required to maintain a letter of credit as collateral. Accordingly, at January 31, 2023 and
April 30, 2022, restricted cash of $ 0.4
million
was pledged as collateral under the letter of credit.
The following table provides a reconciliation
of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total
of the same amounts shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):

Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable is primarily comprised of
amounts owed to us for services provided under our customer contracts and are recorded at the invoiced amount net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts, if necessary. We apply judgement in assessing the ultimate realization of our receivables and we estimate an allowance
for doubtful accounts based on various factors, such as the aging of our receivables, historical experience, and the financial condition
of our customers.
9
Inventory
Inventory consists of raw materials inventory
and is valued at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. We periodically review raw
materials inventory for potential impairment and adjust inventory to its net realizable value based on the estimate of future use and
reduce the carrying value of inventory as deemed necessary.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related asset, which are generally as follows:
Schedule of estimated useful lives of property
Description
Estimated Useful Life
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term
Laboratory and manufacturing equipment
5 – 10 years
Computer equipment and software
3 – 5 years
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment
5 – 10 years
Costs for property and equipment
not yet placed into service have been capitalized as construction-in-progress. These costs are primarily related to equipment and leasehold
improvements associated with our manufacturing facilities and will be depreciated in accordance with the above guidelines once placed
into service. Interest costs incurred during construction of major capital projects are capitalized as construction-in-progress until
the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the
life of the underlying asset. Interest capitalized as construction-in-progress for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 was
$ 0.1
million
and $ 0.4
million , respectively.
No
interest was capitalized as construction-in-progress for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022. All our property and
equipment are located in the United States. Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

million , respectively.
10
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains
a lease at inception. Our operating leases with a term greater than one year are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, less current portion in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date, based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the net present value of lease payments, we use our incremental borrowing
rate which represents an estimated rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow equivalent funds on a collateralized basis at
the lease commencement date.
Our operating leases may include options to extend
the lease which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise a renewal option. Operating lease expense
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
Our finance lease with a term greater than one
year is included as an asset within property and equipment, net and a lease liability equal to the present value of the minimum lease
payments is included in other current liabilities and finance lease liabilities, less current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.
The present value of the finance lease payments is calculated using the implicit interest rate in the lease. Finance lease ROU assets
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset and the carrying amount of the lease liability is adjusted
to reflect interest, which is recorded as interest expense.
Leases with an initial term
of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and lease expense for these short-term leases is recognized on
a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease
components.
Impairment
Long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed
for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances
arise, we compare the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
by the long-lived assets. If the long-lived assets are determined to be impaired, any excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets
over its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were
no
indicators of impairment of the value of our long-lived assets and no cumulative impairment losses were recognized as of January 31, 2023.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock options,
restricted stock units, performance stock units and other stock-based awards granted under our equity compensation plans in accordance
with the authoritative guidance of ASC 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation . The estimated fair value of stock options
granted to employees in exchange for services is measured at the grant date, using a fair value based method, such as a Black-Scholes
option valuation model, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. The fair value of
restricted stock units and performance stock units is measured at the grant date based on the closing market price of our common stock
on the date of grant. For restricted stock units, the fair value is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service periods. For performance stock units, which are subject to performance conditions, the fair value is recognized as expense on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods when the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable.
If a performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met, no stock-based compensation expense is recognized, and any
previously recognized expense is reversed. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur.
11
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs related
to convertible senior notes are recorded as a deduction that is netted against the principal value of the debt and are amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the debt (Note 3).
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is the
change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income is
equal to our net income for all periods presented.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The guidance prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy:
· Level 1 – Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as assets or liabilities
whose values are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices
of instruments with similar attributes in active markets.
· Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and significant
to the overall fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities; therefore, requiring the company to develop its own valuation techniques
and assumptions.
As of January 31, 2023 and April
30, 2022, we did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets and our cash equivalents of $ 50.8
million
and $ 116.3
million , respectively,
were invested in money market funds with one major commercial bank and carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical
securities (Level 1 input). We consider the fair value of our convertible senior notes to be a Level 2 financial liability due to limited
trading activity of the senior convertible notes (Note 3). We did not have any other Level 2 or Level 3 financial liabilities as of January
31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.
Accounting Standards Not
Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Measurement of Credit Losses
of Financial Instruments
(“ASU 2016-13”). The standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial
instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10,
Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates , which required entities to make a
one-time determination of whether an entity is eligible to be a smaller reporting company as of November 15, 2019 for the purpose of determining
the effective date of ASU 2016-13. We determined that we were eligible to be a smaller reporting company as of November 15, 2019, and
therefore, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, which will be our fiscal year 2024 beginning May
1, 2023. We do not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3 –
Debt
Convertible Senior Notes
Due 2026
In March 2021, we issued $ 143.8
million
in aggregate
principal amount of 1.25% exchangeable senior notes due 2026 (“Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds we received from the issuance of Convertible Notes was $ 138.5
million , after deducting initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance related expenses of $ 5.3
million .
12
The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and accrue interest at a rate of
1.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Convertible
Notes mature on
March 15, 2026 , unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders. The Convertible
Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election in
the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the Convertible Notes.
The initial conversion rate for the Convertible
Notes is approximately 47.1403 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which represents an initial conversion price of
approximately $21.21 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date,
we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their Convertible Notes in connection
with such a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture.
Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their
Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2025,
only under the following circumstances: (1) During any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021, if the
last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading
days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the
conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) During the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period
(the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible
Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock
and the exchange rate on each such trading day; (3) If we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to
the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; and (4) Upon the occurrence of specified
corporate events as described in the Indenture.
On or after September 15, 2025 until the close
of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders at their option may convert their Convertible
Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
We may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior
to March 20, 2024. On or after March 20, 2024, the Convertible Notes are redeemable for cash, whole or in part, at our option, if the
last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days
(whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and
including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined
in the Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but excluding the redemption date.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants,
including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare the entire principal of all the Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
to be immediately due and payable.
As of January 31, 2023, the conditions allowing
holders of the Convertible Notes to convert had not been met and, therefore, the Convertible Notes are classified as a long-term liability
on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.

Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the issuance of the Convertible
Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain financial institution
counterparties (the “Option Counterparties”). We used $ 12.8
million
of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible
Notes to pay the cost of the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number
of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes, and are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution
of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap,
based on the cap price of the Capped Calls. The cap share price of the Capped Calls is approximately $28.02 per share, which represents
a premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of our common stock on March 9, 2021 and is subject to certain adjustments under the
terms of the Capped Calls. However, there would nevertheless be dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes to the extent that such
market price exceeds the capped share price as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls.
We evaluated the Capped Calls under ASC 815-10
and determined that they should be accounted for as a separate transaction from the Convertible Notes and that the Capped Calls met the
criteria for equity classification. Therefore, the cost of $12.8 million to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional
paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet at April 30, 2021. The Capped Calls will not be subsequently remeasured as long as the
conditions for equity classification continue to be met. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, there were no conversions of our Convertible
Notes, and therefore, there was no activity with respect to the Capped Calls. We believe the conditions for equity classification continue
to be met as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.
Note 4 –
Leases
We currently lease certain office, manufacturing,
laboratory and warehouse space located in Orange County, California under operating lease agreements. Our leased facilities have original
lease terms ranging from 7 to 12 years, contain multi-year renewal options, and scheduled rent increases of 3% on either an annual or
biennial basis. A multi-year renewal option was included in determining the right-of-use asset and lease liability for one of our leases
as we considered it reasonably certain that we would exercise such renewal option. In addition, certain of our leases provide for periods
of free rent, lessor improvements and tenant improvement allowances, of which certain of these improvements have been classified as leasehold
improvements and/or are being amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the remaining life of the
lease.
14
Certain of our operating facility leases require
us to pay property taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities,
they are recognized as variable lease cost in the period they are incurred.

Performance Stock Units
The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors grants PSUs to our executives. The PSUs are subject to annual vesting over three consecutive fiscal year performance
periods with the first one-third vesting on April 30 of the year following the grant date, and each successive one-third vesting on April
30 of the following two years respectively (each a “Performance Period”). Each PSU that vests represent the right to receive
one share of our common stock. The number of shares that will vest for each Performance Period, if any, is based upon the attainment of
certain predetermined financial metrics for each such Performance Period. Depending on the actual financial metrics achieved relative
to the target financial metrics for such Performance Periods, the number of PSUs issued could range from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
The number of granted shares included in the table below is based on a maximum 200% achievement of each financial metric during each Performance
Period (the “Maximum Performance Target”). If a financial metric is achieved at a rate below the Maximum Performance Target,
or is not achieved, the corresponding portion of the PSUs that do not vest are forfeited.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Avid Bioservices, Inc. 2010
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) is a stockholder-approved plan under which employees can purchase shares of our
common stock, based on a percentage of their compensation, subject to certain limits. The purchase price per share is equal to the lower
of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the six-month offering period or on the last trading day
of the six-month offering period. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, a total of
68,646
shares of our common stock were purchased
under the ESPP at a weighted average purchase price per share of $ 12.22 . As of January 31, 2023, we had
963,316
shares of our common stock
reserved for issuance under the ESPP.

to be recognized over weighted average vesting periods of
1.2
and
2.8
years, respectively.
As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 11 .0 million
of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs associated with the Performance Periods ending April 30,
2023, 2024 and 2025. These costs are expected to be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of
1.1
years, however, we will
assess the likelihood of achieving the predetermined financial metrics associated with each Performance Period on a quarterly basis and
the expense recognized, if any, will be adjusted accordingly.
Note 6 –
Income Taxes
We are subject to taxation in the United States
and various states jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.
Our tax provision for interim periods is determined
using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter. On a quarterly basis, we update
our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter.
The tax expense recorded for the third quarter
of fiscal year 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due primarily to the tax impact of state income taxes, stock-based
compensation, non-deductible officers’ compensation and transportation fringe benefits.
For the three and nine months ended January 31,
2023, we recorded income tax expense of $ 2.1
million
and $ 0.7
million , respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of
82.6 % and
44.9 %,
respectively.
We have
no
material uncertain tax positions as
of January 31, 2023. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and other
income (expense), net, respectively, in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. There
was
no
accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of January 31, 2023.
Note 7 –
Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common
share is computed by dividing our net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income per common share is computed by dividing our net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period plus the potential dilutive effects of stock options, unvested RSUs and PSUs, shares of common stock expected
to be issued under our ESPP, and Convertible Notes.
18
The potential dilutive effect
of stock options, unvested RSUs and PSUs, and shares of common stock expected to be issued under our ESPP during the period are calculated
in accordance with the treasury stock method but are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. The potential dilutive effect of our
Convertible Notes is calculated using the if-converted method assuming the conversion of our Convertible Notes as of the earliest period
reported or at the date of issuance, if later, but are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the numerators
and the denominators of the basic and dilutive net income per common share computations are as follows (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

Commitments
and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, we are at
times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes. We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Such provisions, if any, are reviewed at least quarterly
and adjusted to reflect the impact of any settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other
information and events pertaining to a particular case. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of
which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

Humanigen Arbitration
On December 17, 2021, we filed a Demand for Arbitration
claiming more than $20.5 million in damages against Humanigen, Inc. (“Humanigen”) with the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”) entitled, Avid Bioservices, Inc. v. Humanigen, Inc. (AAA Case No. 01-21-0018-0523). The Demand contains three
claims for: (1) breach of contract concerning the process development and manufacturing master services agreement (“MSA”);
(2) anticipatory breach of contract concerning the capacity expansion and contribution/commitment letter (“Letter Agreement”);
and (3) trade libel and commercial disparagement. On January 6, 2022, Humanigen filed an Answer to our Demand, denying the allegations
and asserting affirmative defenses. On July 1, 2022, Humanigen filed its counterclaims against us in the form of a complaint in the Orange
County Superior Court (Case No. 30-2022-01268184) alleging three claims for (1) breach of the MSA seeking return or reimbursement of the
amounts Humanigen paid us before cancelling the MSA, (2) declaratory relief that Humanigen has no remaining obligations under the Letter
Agreement, and (3) unfair business practices. On July 19, 2022, we filed a motion with the state court to compel all claims by Humanigen
against us to arbitration before the AAA. On October 17, 2022, the state court granted our motion to compel all of Humanigen’s claims
against us to arbitration and denied Humanigen’s motion to stay the arbitration. As a result of the court having granted our motion,
on November 3, 2022, Humanigen filed its Demand for Arbitration realleging the breach of the MSA and unfair business practices claims
which it had initially filed in state court. On November 10, 2022, we filed an Answer to Humanigen’s Demand, denying the allegations
and asserting affirmative defenses. On February 21, 2023, we entered into a Confidential Settlement and Mutual Releases Agreement with
Humanigen resolving the arbitration proceeding and all disputes between the parties.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements
and related notes of Avid Bioservices, Inc. included in Part I Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30,
2022.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize
or prove incorrect, could cause our results of operations to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as, but
not limited to, “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “seek,” “should,”
“target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions or variations intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to management.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described under
the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, those identified
in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in other filings we may make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Moreover,
we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management
to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements and, except as required by law, assume no obligation and
do not intend to update these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a dedicated contract
development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) that provides a comprehensive range of services from process development
to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMP”) clinical and commercial manufacturing of biologics for the biotechnology
and biopharmaceutical industries. With 30 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, our services include
clinical and commercial product manufacturing, bulk packaging, release and stability testing and regulatory submissions support. We also
provide a variety of process development services, including upstream and downstream development and optimization, analytical methods
development, testing and characterization.
Strategic Objectives
We continue to execute on a growth strategy that seeks to align with
the growth of the biopharmaceutical drug substance contract services market. That strategy encompasses the following objectives:
· Invest in additional manufacturing capacity and resources required for us to achieve our long-term growth
strategy and meet the growth-demand of our customers’ programs, moving from development through to commercial manufacturing;
· Broaden market awareness through a diversified yet flexible marketing strategy;
· Expand our customer base and programs with existing customers for both process development and manufacturing
service offerings;
· Explore strategic opportunities both within our core business as well as in adjacent and/or synergistic
service offerings in order to enhance and/or broaden our capabilities; and
· Increase our operating profit margin to best in class industry standards.
21
Third Quarter Highlights
The following summarizes select highlights from
our third quarter ended January 31, 2023:
· Reported revenues of $38.0 million, an increase of 21%, or $6.5 million, compared to the same prior year
period;
· Reported net income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share;
· Expanded our customer base and programs with existing customers and ended the quarter with a backlog of
approximately $176 million;
· Further enhanced our mammalian cell offerings with the addition of in-house cell line development services;
and
· Continued to advance the second phase of expansion of our Myford facility and the construction of our
cell and gene therapy facility.
Facility Expansions
During fiscal year 2021, we announced plans
for a two-phased expansion of our Myford facility. The first phase, which expanded the production capacity of our Myford facility by adding
an additional downstream processing suite, was completed in January 2022. The second phase, which was recently completed in March 2023,
further expands our capacity with the addition of a second manufacturing train, including both upstream and downstream processing suites.
This phase is now operational, and we are actively scheduling new business into the suites. We estimate that as of January 31, 2023, the
remaining cost associated with the completion of our Myford facility expansion is approximately $6 million.
In October 2021, we announced plans to expand
our CDMO service offerings into viral vector development and manufacturing services for the rapidly growing cell and gene therapy (“CGT”)
market. This expansion will consist of a two-phased approach including constructing a world-class, single purpose-built CGT development
and CGMP manufacturing facility in Costa Mesa, California (the “CGT Facility”). In June 2022, we completed the first phase
with the opening of our new analytical and process development laboratories. This phase is operational and we have been generating revenue
from these laboratories since the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The second phase of construction includes the build out of CGMP manufacturing
suites, which are expected to be online by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2023. We estimate that as of January 31, 2023, the
remaining cost to complete our CGT Facility construction is approximately $20 million.
In June 2022, we announced plans to further expand
the process development capacity of our mammalian cell culture services, by adding new suites within our existing process development
laboratory space. This expansion is expected to be online by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2023. We estimate that as of January
31, 2023 the remaining cost to complete our PD construction is approximately $2 million.
Upon completion of these expansion projects, we
estimate that our combined facilities will have the potential to bring our total revenue generating capacity to up to approximately $400
million annually, depending on the mix of future customer projects.
Performance and Financial Measures
In assessing the performance of our business,
we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of
our business are revenues, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income and interest expense.
We intend for this discussion to provide the reader
with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those consolidated
financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.
22
Revenues
Revenues are derived from services provided under
our customer contracts and are disaggregated into manufacturing and process development revenue streams. Manufacturing revenue generally
represents revenue from the manufacturing of customer products derived from mammalian cell culture covering clinical through commercial
manufacturing runs. Process development revenue generally represents revenue from services associated with the custom development of a
manufacturing process and analytical methods for a customer’s product.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is equal to revenues less cost of
revenues. Cost of revenues reflects the direct cost of labor, overhead and material costs. Direct labor costs include compensation, benefits,
recruiting fees, and stock-based compensation within the manufacturing, process and analytical development, quality assurance, quality
control, validation, supply chain, project management and facilities functions. Overhead costs primarily include the rent, common area
maintenance, utilities, property taxes, security, materials and supplies, software, small equipment, and deprecation costs incurred at
our manufacturing and laboratory locations.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenses are composed of corporate-level expenses, including compensation, benefits, recruiting fees, and stock-based compensation of
corporate functions such as executive management, finance and accounting, business development, legal, human resources, information technology,
and other centralized services. SG&A expenses also include corporate legal fees, audit and accounting fees, investor relation expenses,
non-employee director fees, corporate facility related expenses, and other expenses relating to our general management, administration,
and business development activities.

for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $38.0 million compared to $31.5 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase
of $6.5 million, or 21%. The year-over-year increase in revenues can primarily be attributed to increases in manufacturing runs, process
development services provided to new customers, and revenue recognized in the current year period for changes in estimated variable consideration
under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved. The increase in revenues was attributed to the following components of our revenue
streams:
$ millions
Net increase in manufacturing revenues
$ 6.0
Net increase in process development revenues
0.5
Total increase in revenues
$ 6.5
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the three
months ended January 31, 2023 was $9.8 million (26% gross margin) compared to $9.1 million (29% gross margin) for the same period in
the prior year, an increase of $0.7 million. The increase in gross profit can primarily be attributed to an increase in revenues,
partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit related expenses and facility and equipment related costs. During the
three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared with the prior year period, our labor, overhead and depreciation expenses increased
primarily due to the hiring of personnel and additional facility and equipment related costs in anticipation of the commissioning of
our mammalian and cell and gene therapy CGMP facility expansions. This decrease in margin was partially offset by a current year period benefit to margin from
revenue associated with a change in variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved. In addition, the
same period in the prior year included a margin benefit from unutilized capacity fees. Excluding all of these factors, our third
quarter gross margin was slightly higher than the same prior year period.
We expect our gross profit will
continue to be impacted in the short-term as we continue the hiring of personnel and incur additional facility and equipment related costs
in-line with our anticipated growth.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses were $7.1
million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $5.8 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $1.3
million, or 22%. The net increase in SG&A expenses was attributed to the following components:
$ millions
Increase in compensation and benefit related expenses
$ 0.9
Increase in legal and accounting fees
0.2
Increase in consulting and other professional fees
0.1
Net increase in all other SG&A expenses
0.1
Total increase in SG&A expenses
$ 1.3
As a percentage of revenues,
SG&A expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were 19% and 18%, respectively. SG&A expenses are generally
not directly proportional to revenues, but we expect such expenses to increase over time to support the needs of our growing company.
24
Operating Income
Operating income was $2.7 million for the three
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to operating income of $3.3 million for the same period in the prior year. This $0.6 million decrease
in year-over-year operating income can be attributed to the $1.3 million increase in SG&A expenses offset by the $0.7 million increase
in gross profit described above.
Other Income (Expense),
net
Other income (expense), net
(“OI&E”) was income of $0.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to expense of $0.3 million
for the same period in the prior year. The increase in year-over-year OI&E can primarily be attributed to an increase in
interest income of $0.4 million combined with a $0.4 million decrease in loss on disposal of property and equipment.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $2.1 million for the three
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to no income tax expense for the same period in the prior year. The increase in income tax expense
can be attributed to the recording of net income tax expense in the current year period whereas in the prior year period there was no
income tax expense due to a full valuation allowance being in place.
Nine
Months Ended January 31, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended January 31, 2022
Revenues
Revenues
for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 were $109.5 million compared to $88.4 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase
of approximately $21.1 million, or 24%. The year-over-year increase in revenues can primarily be attributed to increases in manufacturing
runs, process development services provided to new customers, and revenue recognized in the current year period for changes in estimated
variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved. The increase in revenues
was attributed to the following components of our revenue streams:
$ millions
Net increase in manufacturing revenues
$ 17.4
Net increase in process development revenues
3.7
Total increase in revenues
$ 21.1
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 was $23.1 million (21% gross margin) compared to $29.7 million (34% gross margin) for the same period
in the prior year, a decrease of $6.6 million. The decrease in gross profit can primarily be attributed to increases in compensation
and benefit related expenses and facility and equipment related costs, partially offset by increased revenues. During the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 as compared with the prior year period, our labor, overhead and depreciation expenses increased
primarily due to the hiring of personnel and additional facility and equipment related costs in anticipation of the commissioning of
our mammalian and cell and gene therapy CGMP facility expansions. This decrease in margin was partially offset by a current year period benefit to margin from
revenue associated with a change in variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved. In addition, the
same period in the prior year included a margin benefit from unutilized capacity fees. Excluding all of these factors, our
year-to-date period gross margin was approximately in-line with the same prior year period.
25
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses were $20.3
million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $15.3 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $5.0
million, or 33%. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were 19% and 17%,
respectively. The net increase in SG&A expenses was attributed to the following components:
$ millions
Increase in compensation and benefit related expenses
$ 3.2
Increase in legal and accounting fees
0.6
Increase in consulting and other professional fees
0.4
Increase in facility and related expenses

Operating Income
Operating income was $2.8 million for the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $14.4 million for the same period in the prior year. This $11.6 million decrease in year-over-year
operating income can be attributed to the $6.6 million decrease in gross profit described above combined with a $5.0 million increase
in SG&A expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $1.8 million for the
nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $2.1 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $0.3 million. The
decrease can primarily be attributed to interest expense of $0.4 million capitalized as construction-in-progress during the current
year period compared to no interest capitalized during the same prior year period.
Other Income (Expense),
net
OI&E was income of $0.6 million for the
nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to expense of $0.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in
year-over-year OI&E can primarily be attributed to an increase in interest income of $0.5 million combined with a $0.3 million
decrease in loss on disposal of property and equipment.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $0.7 million for the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 compared to no income tax expense for the same period in the prior year. The increase in income tax expense
can be attributed to the recording of net income tax expense in the current year period whereas in the prior year period there was no
income tax expense due to a full valuation allowance being in place.
26
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing
cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operations. As of January 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$59.9 million. We believe that our existing cash on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to
fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report.
If cash flows from operations
are not sufficient to support our operations or capital requirements, including our mammalian and cell and gene therapy facility expansions,
then we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to fund our future operations and/or such expansions. We may raise these
funds at the appropriate time, accessing the form of capital that we determine is most appropriate considering the markets available to
us and their respective costs of capital, such as through the issuance of debt or through the public offering of securities. These financings
may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets is dependent
on several factors including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock. The market demand or liquidity of our common
stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our financial results, economic and market conditions,
and global financial crises and economic downturns, which may cause extreme volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets.
In addition, even if we are able to raise additional capital, it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us or it may
contain restrictions on the operations of our business.

our cash flow activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following
contractual and other obligations.
Convertible Senior Notes
In March 2021, we issued $143.8 million in aggregate
principal amount of 1.25% exchangeable senior notes due 2026 (“Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds we received from the issuance of Convertible Notes was $138.5
million, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance related expenses of $5.3 million.
The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and accrue at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September
15, 2021. The Convertible Notes mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted at the option of the
holders. The Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common
stock, at our election in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes.
As of January 31, 2023, the aggregate principal
amount outstanding of our Convertible Notes was $143.8 million. For additional information regarding the Convertible Notes, see Note 3
of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Leases
We lease certain office, manufacturing, laboratory,
and warehouse space located in Orange County, California under multiple operating lease agreements. Our leased facilities have original
lease terms ranging from 7 to 12 years, contain multi-year renewal options, and scheduled rent increases of 3% on either an annual or
biennial basis. We also lease certain manufacturing equipment under a 5-year finance lease that expires in December 2026. As of January
31, 2023, we had outstanding lease obligations of $48.9 million, of which $1.3 million is payable in the remainder of fiscal 2023, $4.8
million is payable in fiscal 2024, $4.7 million is payable in fiscal 2025, $4.8 million is payable in fiscal 2026, $4.6 million is payable
in fiscal 2027, and $28.7 million is payable thereafter.
Capital Expenditures
Our fiscal year 2023 capital expenditures
primarily relate to our mammalian and cell and gene therapy facility expansions in Orange County, California as further discussed in
the “Facility Expansions” section above. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, our capital expenditures were
$52.8 million, and $24.0 million were incurred and accrued as of January 31, 2023, for a total of approximately $76.7
million. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 will be approximately $90 million.
28
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis
of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of
our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what
we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. During the nine months ended
January 31, 2023, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as previously disclosed by us in Part II, Item
7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements applicable to us, please refer to Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the accompanying notes
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Backlog
Our backlog represents, as of
a point in time, future revenue from contracted customer work not yet completed. As of January 31, 2023, our backlog was approximately
$176 million, as compared to approximately $153 million as of April 30, 2022. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be
recognized as revenue over the next twelve (12) months, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not
limited to: the risk that a customer cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of services, in which case we may be required to
refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; the risk that a customer may experience delays
in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated services; the risk that we may not successfully
execute on all customer projects; and the risk that commencement of customer projects may be postponed due to supply chain delays, any
of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenues and profitability.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
During the nine months ended
January 31, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Item 4. Controls And Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
29
We carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
There were no significant changes
in our internal control over financial reporting, during the quarter ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
