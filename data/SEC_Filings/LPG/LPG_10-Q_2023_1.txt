Table of Contents ​ Dorian LPG Ltd. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement s (Expressed in United States Dollars) 1.
Basis of Presentation and General Information ​ Dorian LPG Ltd. (“Dorian”) was incorporated on July 1, 2013 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is headquartered in the United States, and is engaged in the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) worldwide. Specifically, Dorian and its subsidiaries (together “we”, “us”, “our”, or the “Company”) are focused on owning and operating very large gas carriers (“VLGCs”), each with a cargo carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm, in the LPG shipping industry. As of December 31, 2022, our fleet consists of
twenty-two
VLGCs, including
nineteen
fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGCs (“ECO-VLGCs”),
one
82,000 cbm VLGC and
two
time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs. As of December 31, 2022,
thirteen
of our ECO-VLGCs, including
one
of our time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs, are equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as “scrubbers”) to reduce sulfur emissions. We have commitments related to scrubbers on an additional three of our VLGCs. We provide in-house commercial management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool (defined below), which may also receive commercial management services from Phoenix (defined below). Excluding our time chartered-in vessels, we provide in-house technical management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool (defined below).
​ On April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix Tankers Pte. Ltd. (“Phoenix”) began operations of Helios LPG Pool LLC (the “Helios Pool”), which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under variable rate time charters to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. Refer to Note 3 below for further description of the Helios Pool. ​ The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and related Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, operating results and cash flows have been included in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended March 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 2, 2022. ​ Our interim results are subject to seasonal and other fluctuations, and the operating results for any quarter are therefore not necessarily indicative of results that may be otherwise expected for the entire year. ​ 5

Refer to Note 7 below for further information. (3) Upon delivery, the applicable vessel will be operated pursuant to a bareboat charter agreement. Refer to Note 15 below for further information. (4) The applicable vessel is expected to be delivered in calendar year 2023. ​ COVID-19 ​ Since the beginning of calendar year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected economic conditions, supply chains, labor markets, demand for certain shipped goods both regionally and globally, and has also negatively impacted and may continue to impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. Over the course of the pandemic, measures taken to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus have included travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, limitations on public gatherings, impositions on supply chain logistics, lockdowns and other emergency public health measures, resulting in a significant reduction in overall global economic activity and extreme volatility in the global financial markets.
​ At present, we cannot fully ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s future operational performance and financial results. To date, we have experienced increases in crew wages and related costs, particularly in crew travel and medical costs and certain spares and stores and associated transport costs due to COVID-19. Further impacts may be of greater magnitude and may be reflected in different cost items than we have experienced up to this point. If a resurgence of COVID-19, including due to new variants, results in travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions, and other impediments

Table of Contents to the orderly conduct of seaborne trade, such as those caused by China’s “zero-covid” policy, there may be an additional material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Significant Accounting Policies ​ The same accounting policies have been followed in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as those applied in the preparation of our consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 (refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022). ​ Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ​ In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”).” ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance in U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This ASU was effective for adoption at any time between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (“ASU 2022-06”).” ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date included within Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024. We have determined that the adoption of this ASU would have an immaterial effect on our financial statements. ​ ​ ​ 3.  Transactions with Related Parties ​ Dorian (Hellas), S.A. ​ Dorian (Hellas) S.A. (“DHSA”) formerly provided technical, crew, commercial management, insurance and accounting services to our vessels and had agreements to outsource certain of these services to Eagle Ocean Transport Inc. (“Eagle Ocean Transport”), which is
100 % owned by Mr. John C. Hadjipateras, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
​ Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries entered into an agreement with DHSA, retroactive to July 2014 and superseding an agreement between Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. and DHSA, for the provision by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries of certain chartering and marine operation services to DHSA, for which income was earned and included in “Other income-related parties” totaling less than $ 0.1
million
for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $ 0.1
million
for both the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
​ As of December 31, 2022, $ 0.8
million was due from DHSA and included in “Due from related parties” in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2022, $ 1.0
million was due from DHSA and included in “Due from related parties” in the audited consolidated balance sheet. ​ Helios LPG Pool LLC ​ On April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool, which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under variable rate time charters to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. We hold a
50 % interest in the Helios Pool as a joint venture with Phoenix and all significant rights and obligations are equally shared by both parties. All profits of the Helios Pool are distributed to the pool participants based on pool points assigned to each vessel as variable charter hire and, as a result, there are no profits available to the equity investors as a share of equity. We have determined that the Helios Pool is a variable interest entity as it does not have sufficient equity at risk. We do not consolidate the Helios Pool because we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest. In consideration of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10-50-4e, the significant factors considered and judgments made in determining that the power to direct the activities of the Helios Pool that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance are shared, in that all significant performance activities which
7
Table of Contents relate to approval of pool policies and strategies related to pool customers and the marketing of the pool for the procurement of customers for the pool vessels, addition of new pool vessels and the pool cost management, require unanimous board consent from a board consisting of
two
members from each joint venture investor. Further, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 810-10-25-38D, the Company and Phoenix are not related parties as defined in ASC 850 nor are they de facto agents pursuant to ASC 810-10, the power over the significant activities of the Helios Pool is shared, and no party is the primary beneficiary in the Helios Pool, or has a controlling financial interest. As of December 31, 2022, the Helios Pool operated
twenty-three
VLGCs, including
twenty
vessels from our fleet (including
two
vessels time chartered-in from unrelated parties) and
three
Phoenix vessels. ​ As of December 31, 2022, we had net receivables from the Helios Pool of $ 91.9
million (net of amounts due to Helios Pool of $ 6.0
million which are reflected under “Due to related Parties”), including $ 22.0
million of working capital contributed for the operation of our vessels in the pool (of which $ 1.1
million was classified as current). As of March 31, 2022, we had net receivables from the Helios Pool of $ 76.5
million (net of an amount due to Helios Pool of $ 0.1
million which are reflected under “Due to related Parties”), including $ 23.1
million of working capital contributed for the operation of our vessels in the pool (of which $ 3.3
million was classified as current). Our maximum exposure to losses from the pool as of December 31, 2022 is limited to the receivables from the pool. The Helios Pool does not have any third-party debt obligations. The Helios Pool has entered into commercial management agreements with each of Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. and Phoenix and has appointed both as the exclusive commercial managers of pool vessels. Dorian LPG (DK) ApS has assumed the responsibilities of Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. under such agreements with the consolidation of our London, United Kingdom office into our Copenhagen, Denmark office. Fees for such services earned by Dorian LPG (DK) ApS are included in “Other income-related parties” in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations and were $ 0.6
million and $ 0.5
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.6
million
for both the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, we receive a fixed reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards and war risk insurance for vessels operating in high risk areas from the Helios Pool, for which we earned $ 0.6
million and $ 0.4
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.1
million and $ 1.9
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and are included in “Other revenues, net” in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.
​ Through our vessel owning subsidiaries, we have chartered vessels to the Helios Pool during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The time charter revenue from the Helios Pool is variable depending upon the net results of the pool, operating days and pool points for each vessel. The Helios Pool enters into voyage and time charters with external parties and receives freight and related revenue and, where applicable, incurs voyage costs such as bunkers, port costs and commissions. At the end of each month, the Helios Pool calculates net pool revenues using gross revenues, less voyage expenses of all pool vessels, less fixed time charter hire for any chartered-in vessels, less the general and administrative expenses of the pool as variable rate time charter hire for the relevant vessel to participants based on pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, scrubber-equipped, fuel consumption, and speed are taken into consideration) and number of days the vessel participated in the pool in the period. Net pool revenues, less any amounts required for working capital of the Helios Pool, are distributed, to the extent they have been collected from third-party customers of the Helios Pool. We recognize net pool revenues on a monthly basis, when each relevant vessel has participated in the pool during the period and the amount of net pool revenues for the month can be estimated reliably. Revenue earned from the Helios Pool is presented in Note 12.

Concorde
drawn on September 6, 2022. The term loan is for a period of seven ( 7 ) years with an interest rate of SOFR plus a margin of
2.20 %. The margin can be decreased by
five
basis points if the leverage ratio (which is based on the ratio of the debt outstanding to the aggregate market value of our vessels secured under the 2022 Debt Facility) is less than
35 % or increased by
five
basis points if it is greater than or equal to
45 %. The 2022 Debt Facility agreement also includes a provision to receive a five basis point increase or reduction in the margin for reductions in our average efficiency ratio (which weighs carbon emissions for a voyage against the design deadweight of a vessel and the distance traveled on such voyage) versus the level set by the International Maritime Organization. This is calculated annually and, as of December 31, 2022, our margin has been reduced by
five
basis points to
2.15 %.
The 2022 Debt Facility is secured by, among other things, (i) first priority Bahamian mortgages on the vessels financed, (ii) first priority assignments of all of the financed vessels’ mandatory insurances and earnings and management agreements; (iii) first priority pledge in respect of all limited liability company interests of the borrowers and vessel-owning guarantors; (iv) first priority charter assignments of all of the financed vessels’ long-term charters to non-Helios LPG Pool parties with an original tenor greater than 13 months; and (v) a guaranty by the Company guaranteeing the obligations of the borrower and other guarantors under the facility agreement. The 2022 Debt Facility further provides that the facility is secured by assignments of the borrower’s rights under any hedging contracts in connection with the facility. The 2022 Debt Facility also contains customary covenants that require us to maintain adequate insurance coverage and to properly maintain the vessels. The loan facility includes customary events of default, including those relating to a failure to pay principal or interest, breaches of covenants, representations and warranties, a cross-default to certain other debt obligations and non-compliance with security documents, and customary restrictions on paying dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing, or if an event of default would result therefrom. The following financial covenants are the most restrictive from the 2022 Debt Facility with which the Company is required to comply, calculated on a consolidated basis, determined and defined according to the provisions of the loan agreement and its amendments: ​ ● The ratio of current assets and long-term restricted cash divided by current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt, shall always be greater than
1.00 ; ​ ● Maintain minimum shareholders’ equity at all times equal to the aggregate of $ 400
million; ​ ● The ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated total capitalization shall not exceed
0.60
to
1.00 ; ​ ● Fair market value of the mortgaged ships plus any additional security over the outstanding loan balance shall not be less than
145 %; and ​ ● Minimum liquidity covenant of the greater of (i) $ 27.5
million and (ii)
5 % of consolidated interest-bearing debt. ​ We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. ​ Corsair Japanese Financing ​ Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 for information on the refinancing of our 2014-built VLGC,

Table of Contents Cougar Japanese Financing
​ On May 19, 2022, we refinanced a 2015-built VLGC,
Cougar , pursuant to a memorandum of agreement and a bareboat charter agreement. In connection therewith, we transferred  Cougar  to the buyer for $ 70.0  million and, as part of the agreement, Dorian Shanghai LPG Transport LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, bareboat chartered the vessel back for a period of  10 years , with purchase options from the end of year  3  onwards through a mandatory buyout by 2032. We continue to technically manage, commercially charter, and operate  Cougar . We received $ 50.0  million in cash as part of the transaction with $ 20.0  million to be retained by the buyer as a deposit (the “Cougar Deposit”), which can be used by us towards the repurchase of the vessel either pursuant to an early buyout option or at the end of the  10 -year bareboat charter term. The refinancing proceeds of $ 50.0  million were used to prepay $ 20.0  million of the 2015 AR Facility’s then outstanding principal amount. The remaining proceeds will be used to pay legal fees associated with this transaction and for general corporate purposes. This transaction will be treated as a financing transaction and  Cougar  will continue to be recorded as an asset on our balance sheet. This debt financing has a floating interest rate of
three-month
SOFR plus a margin of  2.45 %, not including financing costs of $ 0.4  million, monthly broker commission fees of  1.25 % over the  10 -year term on interest and principal payments made, broker commission fees of  0.5 % on the exercise of the purchase option or obligation excluding the Cougar Deposit, and a quarterly fixed straight-line principal obligation of approximately $ 0.9  million over the  10 -year term with a balloon payment of $ 14.0  million. ​ Debt Obligations ​ The table below presents our debt obligations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      March 31, 2022   2015 AR Facility ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Commercial Financing ​ $

​ 13.  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures
​ Our principal financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from related parties, investment securities, long-term investments and trade accounts receivable. Our principal financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties, accrued liabilities, and derivative instruments. 15
Table of Contents ​ (a) Concentration of credit risk:   Financial instruments, which may subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of amounts due from our charterers, including the receivables from Helios Pool, and cash and cash equivalents. We limit our credit risk with amounts due from our charterers, including those through the Helios Pool, by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our charterers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral from our charterers. We limit our credit risk with our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash by placing it with highly-rated financial institutions. ​ (b) I nterest rate risk:   Our long-term bank loans are primarily based on SOFR and hence we are exposed to movements thereto. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge a majority of our variable interest rate exposure related to our 2022 Debt Facility. On August 8, 2022, our interest rate swap with Citibank N.A. was novated to CACIB and BNP with the original amount equally apportioned to each counterparty, an adjustment in the fixed rate from
1.0908 %
to
0.9208 %
and a change in the indexed rate from LIBOR to SOFR. On August 25, 2022, our interest rate with ING was amended with an adjustment in the fixed rate from
1.145 %
to
0.915 %
and the indexed rate changed from LIBOR to SOFR. Additionally, we have exposure to floating rate movements on two of our Japanese Financings. The Cougar Japanese Financing is subject to SOFR and the Cresques Japanese Financing is the only debt agreement which is subject to LIBOR. ​ (c) Fair value measurements:
Interest rate swaps are stated at fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow approach based on market ‑ based SOFR swap yield rates. SOFR swap rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the swaps and, therefore, are considered Level 2 items in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount that we would have to pay or receive for the early termination of the agreements. ​ The following table summarizes the location on the balance sheet of the financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, which comprise our financial derivatives, all of which are considered Level 2 items in accordance with the fair value hierarchy: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2022 ​ ​ March 31, 2022   ​ ​ Other non-current assets ​ Long-term liabilities ​ Other non-current assets ​ Long-term liabilities   Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Derivative instruments      Derivative instruments      Derivative instruments      Derivative instruments   Interest rate swap agreements ​ $

In addition to the derivatives that we are required to record at fair value on our balance sheet (see (c) above) and investment securities that are included in other current assets in our balance sheet that we record at fair value, we have other financial instruments that are carried at historical cost. These financial instruments include trade accounts receivable, amounts due from related parties, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties and accrued liabilities for which the historical carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment securities are considered Level 1 items.

2,587,749 ​ ​ Commitments under Bareboat Charter Header Agreement ​ On March 31, 2021, we entered into a
thirteen-year
bareboat charter agreement for a newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC that is expected to be delivered from Kawasaki Heavy Industries in March 2023. The structure of the financing of the newbuilding is analogous to that of our Japanese Financings in which a third party will purchase the vessel and we will bareboat charter such vessel from the third party. As part of the agreement, we control the building of the vessel and the use of the vessel after it is delivered. The vessel will be built to our specifications; we will supervise the building of the vessel to meet these specifications; and we will technically and commercially manage the vessel after its delivery. Under the agreement, we had commitments of $ 24.0
million of predelivery costs as well as the cost of additional features to meet our specifications and supervision costs for an aggregate total of approximately $ 25.0
million. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 1.0
million of commitments under the agreement outstanding that we expect to settle during the year ending March 31, 2023. Construction of the vessel commenced in December 2021. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 18

Such claims, even if lacking in merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We are not aware of any claim other than that described below, which is reasonably possible and should be disclosed or probable and for which a provision should be established in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
​ 16. Subsequent Events ​ Interest Rate Swap On January 20, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with ING in order to manage our variable interest rate exposure risk by effectively converting a portion of our debt from a floating to a fixed rate. The notional value increases as other swaps amortize and then decreases with the debt outstanding under the 2022 Debt Facility until final settlement in July 2029. The effect is to maintain a constant ratio between the debt outstanding under the 2022 Debt Facility and the notional hedges. The initial notional value is $ 3.5
million with an effective date of June 26, 2023 and a fixed interest rate of
2.8525 %. Dividend On February 1, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $ 1.00  per share of the Company’s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2023, totaling $ 40.4  million. The dividend is payable on or about February 28, 2023. ​ 19
Table of Contents ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSI S OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ​ The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please also see the section “Forward-Looking Statements” included in this quarterly report. ​ Overview ​ We are a Marshall Islands corporation headquartered in the United States and primarily focused on owning and operating VLGCs, each with a cargo-carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm, in the LPG shipping industry. Our fleet currently consists of twenty-two VLGC carriers, including nineteen fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO-VLGCs, one 82,000 cbm VLGCs, and two time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs. We have equipped twelve of our ECO-VLGCs and time chartered-in one vessel with scrubbers and we have commitments related to scrubbers on an additional three of our vessels as of January 27, 2023. Vessels fitted with scrubbers allow us to reduce our emissions and to burn less refined fuel, which is frequently cheaper than more refined, lower sulfur grades. When the cost of more refined fuel exceeds that of less refined fuel, we are typically able to earn a higher TCE for spot voyages and to potentially contract time charters at higher rates compared to vessels without scrubbers.
​ Dorian’s nineteen ECO-VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency, emission-reducing technologies, and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion and delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered during calendar year 2015 or later. ​ On April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool, which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to contracts of affreightment, or COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. As of January 27, 2023, twenty of our twenty-two VLGCs were employed in the Helios Pool, including our two time chartered-in VLGCs. ​ Our customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co., Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Equinor ASA, Total S.A., and Sunoco LP, commodity traders such as Glencore plc, Itochu Corporation, Bayegan Group, Vilma Oil SL, and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., Indian Oil Corporation, SK Gas Co. Ltd., Astomos Energy Corporation, and Oriental Energy Company Ltd. or subsidiaries of the foregoing.
​ We continue to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Currently, two of our VLGCs are on fixed-rate time charters outside of the Helios Pool. See “Our Fleet” below for more information and the definition of Pool-TCO. ​ Recent Developments ​ Interest Rate Swap ​ On January 20, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with ING in order to manage our variable interest rate exposure risk by effectively converting a portion of our debt from a floating to a fixed rate. The notional value increases as other swaps amortize and then decreases with the debt outstanding under the 2022 Debt Facility until final settlement in July 2029. The effect is to maintain a constant ratio between the debt outstanding under the 2022 Debt Facility and the notional hedges. The initial notional value is $3.5 million with an effective date of June 26, 2023 and a fixed interest rate of 2.8525%. ​ ​ 20

50.6 % ​ Revenues, which represent net pool revenues—related party, time charters and other revenues, net, were $103.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $34.7 million, or 50.6%, from $68.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in average TCE rates, partially offset by a decrease in fleet utilization. Average TCE rates increased by $19,260 per operating day from $33,508 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $52,768 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher spot rates despite higher bunker prices. The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged $119.106 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an average of $59.252 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The average price of very low sulfur fuel oil (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton) from Singapore and Fujairah increased from $609 during the three months ended December 31, 2021, to $676 during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our fleet utilization decreased from 98.5% during the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 97.8% during the three months ended December 31, 2022. ​ Charter Hire Expenses ​ Charter hire expenses for the vessels chartered in from third parties were $5.2 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $0.3 million, or 6.1%, was mainly caused by an increase in the number of chartered-in days from 169 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 184 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
​ Vessel Operating Expenses
​ Vessel operating expenses were $17.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, or $9,739 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time-period for the technically-managed vessels that were in our fleet. The decrease of $0.3 million, or 1.6% from $18.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was due to a reduction of calendar days for our fleet from 1,932 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 1,840 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the sale of
Captain Nicholas ML
prior to the three months ended December 31, 2022 .
The increase of $315 per vessel per calendar day, from $9,423 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $9,739 per vessel per calendar day for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of increases of $115 per vessel per calendar day in operating expenses related to lubricants, $110 per vessel per calendar day in operating expenses related to repairs and maintenance, and spares and stores, and $65 per vessel per calendar day in operating expenses related to crew wages and related costs, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. ​ General and Administrative Expenses ​ General and administrative expenses were $6.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.0 million, or 18.4%, from $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by $0.2 million in financial support for the families of our Ukrainian and Russian seafarers affected by the events in Ukraine and increases of $0.4 million and $0.4 million in stock-based compensation and other general and administrative expenses, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 22
Table of Contents Interest and Finance Costs ​ Interest and finance costs amounted to $8.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.2 million, or 16.5%, from $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $1.2 million during this period was mainly due to an increase of $3.1 million in interest incurred on our long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in amortization of financing costs resulting from the refinancing of
Commander
and
Constellation
during the three months ended December 31, 2021, and an increase in capitalized interest of $0.3 million. The increase in interest on our long-term debt was driven by an increase in average interest rates due to rising SOFR on our floating-rate long-term debt, and an increase in average indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, from $576.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $645.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in average indebtedness is due to the 2022 Debt Facility refinancing prior to the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of our long-term debt, net of deferred financing fees of $6.3 million, was $629.3 million. ​ Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives
​ Unrealized loss on derivatives amounted to $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a gain of $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $3.8 million swing is attributable to reductions in notional amounts and an unfavorable change in forward SOFR yield curves (forward LIBOR curves in the prior period). ​ Realized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives
​ Realized gain on derivatives amounted to $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a realized loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The favorable $2.3 million difference is due to an increase in floating SOFR resulting in the realized gain on our interest rate swaps. ​ ​ Results of Operations – For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 ​ Revenues ​ The following table compares our revenues for the nine months ended December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Increase / ​ Percent ​ ​      2022      2021      (Decrease)      Change ​ Net pool revenues—related party   $

31.6 % ​ Revenues, which represent net pool revenues—related party, time charters and other revenues, net, were $256.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $61.5 million, or 31.6%, from $194.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in average TCE rates, partially offset by a decrease in fleet utilization. Average TCE rates increased by $12,401 per operating day from $32,034 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to $44,435 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher spot rates despite higher bunker prices. The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged $86.882 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an average of $51.201 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The average price of very low sulfur fuel oil (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), from Singapore and Fujairah increased from $552 during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, to $827 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Our fleet utilization decreased from 96.8% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to 94.8% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. ​ 23
Table of Contents Charter Hire Expenses ​ Charter hire expenses for the vessels chartered in from third parties were $16.0 million and $10.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $5.2 million, or 47.5%, was mainly caused by an increase in the number of chartered-in days from 399 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to 550 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
​ Vessel Operating Expenses
​ Vessel operating expenses were $52.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, or $9,553 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time-period for the technically-managed vessels that were in our fleet. The decrease of $4.4 million, or 7.7% from $56.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was due to a reduction of calendar days for our fleet from 5,935 during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to 5,500 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the sales of
Captain Markos NL
and
Captain Nicholas ML
prior to the nine months ended December 31, 2022 .
On a per vessel per calendar day basis, vessel operating expenses were relatively flat, slightly decreasing $37 per vessel per calendar day, from $9,590 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to $9,553 per vessel per calendar day for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The slight reduction was primarily the result of a decrease of $154 per vessel per calendar day in operating expenses related to repairs and maintenance, and spares and stores, partially offset by an increase of $134 per vessel per calendar day in operating expenses related to lubricants.
​ General and Administrative Expenses ​ General and administrative expenses were $24.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.2 million, or 5.5%, from $23.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by $0.8 million in financial support for the families of our Ukrainian and Russian seafarers affected by the events in Ukraine and increases of $0.8 million and $0.7 million in stock-based compensation and other general and administrative expenses, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This was partially offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses of $1.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
​ Interest and Finance Costs ​ Interest and finance costs amounted to $28.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $10.0 million, or 53.6%, from $18.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $10.0 million during this period was mainly due to increases of (1) $8.0 million in interest incurred on our long-term debt, (2) $2.0 million in accelerated amortization of financing costs resulting from the repayment of the 2015 AR Facility and long-term debt on
Concorde
and
Corvette , (3) $1.0 million in loan expenses driven by increases in average interest rates on our long-term debt due to rising SOFR on our floating-rate long-term debt, and $0.9 million in capitalized interest.  The increase in interest on our long-term debt was driven by an increase in average interest rates due to rising SOFR on our floating-rate long-term debt, and an increase in average indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, from $587.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 to $663.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, driven by the 2022 Debt Facility refinancing during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of our long-term debt, net of deferred financing fees of $6.3 million, was $629.3 million. ​ Unrealized Gain on Derivatives
​ Unrealized gain on derivatives amounted to $4.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $4.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The $0.6 million difference is primarily attributable to favorable changes in forward SOFR yield curves (forward LIBOR curves in the prior period). ​ Realized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives
​ Realized gain on derivatives amounted to $2.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a realized loss of $2.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The favorable $4.7 million difference is due to an increase in floating SOFR resulting in the realized gain on our interest rate swaps. 24
Table of Contents Gain on Disposal of Vessel
​ Gain on disposal of vessel amounted to $3.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and was attributable to the sale of
Captain Markos NL . There was no gain on disposal of vessel for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. ​ Operating Statistics and Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures ​ To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP, we present certain operating statistics and non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and time charter equivalent rate. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and revenues, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.   ​ We use these non-GAAP measures in assessing the performance of our ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future periods. These adjusted measures provide a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings and are measures commonly used by shareholders to measure our performance. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our business results and assessing our prospects for future performance.  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended

9,590 ​ ​ (1) Adjusted EBITDA is an unaudited non-U.S. GAAP measure and represents net income/(loss) before interest and finance costs, unrealized (gain)/loss on derivatives, realized (gain)/loss on interest rate swaps, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization and is used as a supplemental measure by management to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period and management makes business and resource-allocation decisions based on such comparisons. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of derivatives, interest and finance costs, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization expense, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income/(loss) between periods. We believe that including adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives. ​ Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in use and should not be considered an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income/(loss). Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be computed consistently with similarly titled measures of other companies and, therefore, might not be comparable with other companies. ​ 25

Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period. ​ (3) We define time chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we time chartered-in vessels from third parties.
Time chartered-in days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of charter hire expenses that are recorded during that period.
​ (4) We define available days as the sum of calendar days and time chartered-in days (collectively representing our commercially-managed vessels) less aggregate off hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues. ​ (5) We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that the commercially-managed vessels in our fleet are off ‑ hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance (e.g., repositioning following drydocking, commercial waiting, etc.). We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire (refer to 8 below). ​ (6) We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non - scheduled off - hire days would reduce our operating days, and, therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels. ​ (7) Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period ‑ to ‑ period changes in a shipping company’s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods and is a factor in management’s business decisions. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period, which may not be calculated the same by other companies. Note that our calculation of TCE includes our portion of the net profit of the Helios Pool, which may also cause our calculation to differ from that of companies which do not account for pooling arrangements as we do. ​ 26

Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources
​ Our business is capital intensive, and our future success depends on our ability to maintain a high - quality fleet. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $129.8 million and non-current restricted cash of $0.1 million. ​ Our primary sources of capital during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $126.0 million in cash generated from operations and $29.9 million in net proceeds from the refinancing of
Cougar . As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of our long-term debt, net of deferred financing fees of $6.3 million, was $629.3 million including $52.1 million of principal on our long-term debt scheduled to be repaid within the next twelve months. ​ Operating expenses, including expenses to maintain the quality of our vessels in order to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, the funding of working capital requirements, long-term debt repayments, financing costs, commitments under the bareboat charter for a newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC, and drydocking on certain of our VLGCs represent our short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate satisfying our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months with cash on hand and cash from operations. We may also seek additional liquidity by drawing down our $20.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility or through alternative sources of debt financings and/or through equity financings by way of private or public offerings. However, if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our short-term liquidity needs, or to satisfy our future medium-term or long-term liquidity needs, we may need to seek alternative sources of financing and/or modifications of our existing credit facility and financing arrangements. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing or modifications to our existing credit facility and financing arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. ​ On February 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common shares (the “2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority”). Under these authorizations, when in force, purchases were and may be made at our discretion in the form of open market repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or a combination of these methods. The actual amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability, our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders, and market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, our total purchases under the 2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority totaled 0.05 million shares for an aggregate consideration of $0.7 million. We are not obligated to make any common share repurchases. ​ On May 4, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $2.50 per share of our common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2022, totaling $100.3 million. We paid $99.7 million on June 2, 2022 with the remaining $0.6 million deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest. ​ On June 15, 2022, we paid $0.2 million of dividends that were deferred until the vesting of certain restricted stock. ​ On August 3, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company’s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2022, totaling $40.3 million. We paid $40.1 million on September 2, 2022 and the remaining $0.2 million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest. ​ On August 5, 2022, we paid $0.4 million of dividends that were deferred until the vesting of certain restricted stock. ​ On October 27, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company’s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022, totaling $40.4 million. We paid $40.1 million on December 6, 2022 and the remaining $0.3 million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest. ​ 28
Table of Contents These were irregular dividends. All declarations of dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of our Board of Directors based on its consideration of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, anticipated capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in its debt agreements, restrictions under applicable law, its business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend policy will also impact our future liquidity position. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. ​ On May 19, 2022, we refinanced a 2015-built VLGC,  Cougar , pursuant to a memorandum of agreement and a bareboat charter agreement. We received $50.0 million in cash as part of the transaction with $20.0 million to be retained by the buyer as a deposit, which can be used by us towards the repurchase of the vessel either pursuant to an early buyout option or at the end of the 10-year bareboat charter term. The refinancing proceeds of $50.0 million were used to prepay $20.0 million of the 2015 AR Facility’s then outstanding principal amount. ​ On July 21, 2022, we repurchased
Corvette
for $42.2 million in cash and the application of the deposit amount of $14.0 million.
Corvette
was subsequently refinanced under the 2022 Debt Facility. ​ On July 29, 2022, we entered into a $260.0 million debt financing facility with CACIB, ING, SEB, BNP, and DSF to refinance indebtedness under the 2015 AR Facility and the Concorde Japanese Financing (upon its repurchase in September 2022) and to releverage
Corvette
following the repurchase of that vessel from its owners on July 21, 2022. The 2022 Debt Facility consists of (i) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $240.0 million and (ii) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million. The loan comprised two separate drawdowns with $216.0 million drawn on August 4, 2022 relating to nine of our VLGCs, and the remaining $24.0 million relating to
Concorde
drawn on September 6, 2022. The term loan is for a period of seven (7) years with an interest rate of SOFR plus a margin currently at 2.15%.
​ On September 6, 2022, we repurchased
Concorde
for $41.2 million in cash and application of the deposit amount of $14.0 million.
Concorde
was refinanced under the 2022 Debt Facility. ​ As part of our growth strategy, we will continue to consider strategic opportunities, including the acquisition or charter-in of additional vessels. We may choose to pursue such opportunities through internal growth, joint ventures, business acquisitions, or other transactions. We expect to finance the purchase price of any future acquisitions either through internally generated funds, public or private debt financings, public or private issuances of additional equity securities or a combination of these forms of financing. ​ Cash Flows ​ The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by/(used in) operating, financing and investing activities for the nine months ended December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 ​ 2021 ​ Net cash provided by operating activities $

The increase in cash generated from operations of $37.2 million is primarily related to an increase in cash flows from operating profits (refer to Results of Operations – For the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, for drivers of changes in revenues and expenses for the applicable periods), partially offset by changes in working capital. The unfavorable change in working capital was mainly from amounts due from the Helios Pool as distributions from the Helios Pool are impacted by the timing of the completion of voyages, spot market rates and bunker prices . 29
Table of Contents ​ Net cash flow from operating activities depends upon our overall profitability, market rates for vessels employed on voyage charters and in the Helios Pool, charter rates agreed to for time charters, the timing and amount of payments for drydocking expenditures and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fluctuations in working capital balances and bunker costs. ​ Investing Cash Flows.   Net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $22.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $10.1 million of capital expenditure payments for vessels and vessels under construction and a $1.8 million purchase of long-term investments, partially offset by $2.0 million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was comprised of $43.3 million in proceeds, net of commission, on the sale of our 2006-built VLGC  Captain Markos NL  and $3.7 million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities, partially offset by $22.2 million of capital expenditure payments for vessels and vessels under construction, and $2.3 million in purchases of long-term investments. ​ Financing Cash Flows.   Net cash used in financing activities was $222.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $80.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of (i) repayments of long-term debt of $324.4 million, including the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the 2015 AR Facility ($25.0 million), the prepayment of a portion of the 2015 AR Facility in relation to the refinancing of Cougar ($20.0 million), and the prepayment of the remaining outstanding balances of the 2015 AR Facility ($158.7 million), the Corvette Japanese Financing ($42.8 million) and the Concorde Japanese Financing ($42.3 million) in order to refinance 10 VLGCs under the 2022 Debt Facility; (ii) dividend payments of $180.5 million; (iii) payments of financing costs totaling $6.3 million, and (iv) payments to repurchase common stock of $1.7 million. ​ This is partially offset by proceeds of $290.0 million from the 2022 Debt Facility ($240.0 million) and the refinancing of
Cougar
($50.0 million). For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of (i) repayments of long-term debt of $100.5 million, including the prepayment of a portion of the 2015 AR Facility in relation to the refinancing of two VLGCs ($47.1 million) and the repayment in full of the CMNL/CJNP Japanese Financing, (ii) a dividend payment of $40.2 million, (iii) payments to repurchase common stock of $21.3 million, and (iv) payments of financing costs totaling $1.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of $83.4 million from the BALCAP Facility. ​ Capital Expenditures.   LPG transportation is a capital ‑ intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance. ​ We are generally required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years. Drydocking of vessels occurs every five years unless an extension is granted by the classification society to seven and one-half years and the vessel is not older than 20 years of age. Intermediate surveys are performed every two and one-half years after the first special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 10 to 20 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels.
​ As our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cash outlay for a VLGC special survey to be approximately $1.0 million per vessel (excluding any capital improvements, such as scrubbers and ballast water management systems, to the vessel that may be made during such drydockings and the cost of an intermediate survey to be between $100,000 and $200,000 per vessel. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs. In order to comply with the International Maritime Organization mandated reductions in sulfur emissions that came into effect January 1, 2020, we have installed scrubbers on twelve of our vessels and have one chartered-in scrubber-equipped vessel, which allows us to burn heavy fuel oil. We have entered into contracts to purchase scrubbers on three of our VLGCs, in which we have $3.4 million in remaining contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022. Our other vessels currently consume compliant fuels on board (0.5% sulfur), which are readily available globally, but at a significantly higher cost. Our newbuilding will have the capability to burn LPG. Please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our

Table of Contents Company—We may incur increasing costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. ​ On March 31, 2021, we entered into a thirteen-year bareboat charter agreement for a newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC that is expected to be delivered from Kawasaki Heavy Industries in March 2023. The structure of the financing of the newbuilding is analogous to that of our Japanese Financings in which a third-party will purchase the vessel and we will bareboat charter such vessel from the third party. As part of the agreement, we control the building of the vessel and the use of the vessel after it is delivered. The vessel will be built to our specifications; we will supervise the building of the vessel to meet these specifications; and we will technically and commercially manage the vessel after its delivery. Under the agreement, we had commitments of $24.0 million of predelivery costs as well as the cost of additional features to meet our specifications and supervision costs for an aggregate total of approximately $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.0 million of commitments under the agreement outstanding that we expect to settle during the year ending March 31, 2023. Construction of the vessel commenced in December 2021. ​ Debt Agreements ​ For information relating to our secured term loan facilities, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 and Note 7 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2022 included herein.

We review our vessels for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment.
​ Our estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including:
​ ● reports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values; ​ ● news and industry reports of similar vessel sales; ​ ● approximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated; ​ ● offers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and ​ 31
Table of Contents ● vessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers.
​ As we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.
​ As of December 31, 2022, independent appraisals of our commercially and technically-managed VLGCs in our fleet had no indications of impairment on any of our VLGCs in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment. No impairment charges were recognized for December 31, 2022. ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ​ We have considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and believe that none of these recent pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. ​ ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE S ABOUT MARKET RISK ​ For additional discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. ​ Interest Rate Risk ​ The LPG shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment. Much of this investment is provided in the form of long-term debt. Our 2022 Debt Facility agreement and certain Japanese financings as described in footnote 7 contain interest rates that fluctuate with SOFR and LIBOR. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to fluctuations of interest rate risk associated with our 2022 Debt Facility. We have hedged $195.2 million of amortizing principal of the 2022 Debt Facility as of December 31, 2022 and thus increasing interest rates could adversely impact our future earnings due to additional interest expense on our unhedged debt. For the 12 months following December 31, 2022, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 20 basis points in the underlying SOFR and LIBOR rates would result in an increase or decrease of our interest expense on all of our non-hedged interest-bearing debt by $0.3 million assuming all other variables are held constant.
​ ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S ​ Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures ​ An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. ​ Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ​ There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32

​ PART II — OTHER INFORMATIO N ​ ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDING S ​ From time to time, we expect to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. Such claims, even if lacking in merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We are not aware of any claim that is reasonably possible and should be disclosed or probable and for which a provision should be established in the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTOR S ​ Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common shares. The following is an update to the risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. ​ Our business may be affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation, higher interest rates, market volatility, economic uncertainty, and global supply chain constraints. ​ Various macroeconomic factors, including rising inflation, higher interest rates, global supply chain constraints, and the effects of overall economic conditions and uncertainties such as those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflation and rising interest rates may negatively impact us by increasing our operating costs and our cost of borrowing. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the operation of our business and our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all. ​ ITEM 6.   EXHIBIT S ​ See accompanying Exhibit Index for a list of exhibits filed or furnished with this report. ​ ​ 33
