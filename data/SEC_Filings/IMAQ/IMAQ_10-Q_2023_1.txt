Table of Contents ​ INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS International Media Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on January 15, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with
one
or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region (excluding China) for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022, related to the Company’s formation and initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and identifying a target Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. On August 16, 2022, the board of directors of International Media Acquisition Corp. (the “ Company ”) approved a change to the Company’s fiscal year end from December 31 to March 31, in accordance with the Company’s Bylaws. The Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-QT for the transition period from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022 on September 29, 2022. The registration statement filed in connection with the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on July 28, 2021. On August 2, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of
20,000,000
units (the “Units”), at $ 10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 200,000,000 , which is discussed in Note 3. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of
714,400
units (the “Private Units”), at a price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit in a private placement to the Company’s sponsor, Content Creation Media LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $ 7,144,000 , which is described in Note 4. On August 6, 2021, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase up to
3,000,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, the Company consummated the sale of an additional
3,000,000
Units, generating gross proceeds of $ 30,000,000 . Simultaneously with the closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional
82,500
Private Units, at a price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit, in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $ 825,000 . Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, a total of $ 230,000,000
was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and was invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below. The Company will provide the holders (the “public stockholders”) of the shares of common stock included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $ 10.00
per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s rights or warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
(“ASC 480”). 7
Table of Contents The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $ 5,000,001
either prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval and assuming a quorum is present at the meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor and the other holders of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, their Private Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or don’t vote at all. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of
20 % or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Sponsor and the other initial stockholders (as defined in Note 5) have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, Private Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive their liquidation rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete (a Business Combination within
15
months (or up to
18 months
if the Company extends the period of time) from the closing of the In itial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem
100 % of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
15
months (or up to
18 months
if the Company extends the period of time) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, if the Sponsor and the other initial stockholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). The Company will have until
15
months (or up to
18 months
if the Company extends the period of time) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). On January 27, 2023, IMAQ held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). As approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) which became effective upon filing. The Charter Amendment changed the date by which IMAQ must consummate an initial business combination for an additional three (3) months, from February 2, 2023 to May 2, 2023, with an ability to further extend by three (3) additional one (1) month periods until August 2, 2023 (the “Amended Combination Period”). If the Company is unable to complete a  Business Combination within the Amended Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than
ten
business days thereafter, redeem
100 % of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining holders of common stock and the board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s rights and warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Amended Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Amended Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($ 10.00 ). 8
Table of Contents In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $ 10.00
per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $ 10.00
per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. On October 22, 2022, International Media Acquisition Corp. (“IMAQ”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Risee Entertainment Holdings Private Limited, a company incorporated in India (“Seller”), and Reliance Entertainment Studios Private Limited, company incorporated in India (the “Target Company”). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, a business combination between the Company and the Target Company will be effected by the acquisition of
100 % of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target Company from Seller in a series of transactions (collectively, the “Stock Acquisition”). The aggregate purchase price for the shares of the Target Company under the SPA is $ 102,000,000 , and in addition, the Company also agreed to make a primary investment into the Target Company in the amount of $ 38,000,000 , which will be used solely for the purposes of repayment of inter-company loans aggregating to $ 38,000,000
as existing on the books of the Target Company at the initial closing of the Stock Acquisition. Extension Payment and Shares Redemption Initially, the Company was required to complete its initial business combination transaction by August 2, 2022, which was
12
months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Combination Period”). On July 26, 2022, at a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “Extension Meeting”), the stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of July 28, 2021 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), allowing the Company to extend the Combination Period
two
times for an additional
three months
each time, or from August 2, 2022 to February 2, 2023 (the “Trust Amendment”) by depositing into the Trust Account $ 350,000
for each three-month extension. In connection with the proposal, the Company’s public stockholders had the right to redeem their shares of common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two days prior to such stockholder vote. Public stockholders holding
20,858,105
shares of the Company’s common stock (out of a total of
23,000,000
shares of common stock held by public stockholders) exercised their right to redeem such shares at a redemption price of approximately $ 10.03
per share. On January 27, 2023, IMAQ held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). As approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) which became effective upon filing. The Charter Amendment changed the date by which IMAQ must consummate an initial business combination for an additional three (3) months, from February 2, 2023 to May 2, 2023, with an ability to further extend by three (3) additional one (1) month periods until August 2, 2023 (the “Amended Combination Period”).
On July 26, 2022, the extension payment of $ 350,000
was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the August 2, 2022, deadline to November 2, 2022. On October 28, 2022, a second extension payment of $ 350,000
was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the November 2, 2022, deadline to February 2, 2023. On February 3, 2023, third extension payment of $ 385,541
was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the  February 2, 2023, deadline to May 2, 2023. Liquidity and Going Concern As of December 31, 2022, the Company held cash outside the Trust Account of $ 158,952
available for working capital needs. All remaining cash held in the Trust Account is generally unavailable for the Company’s use, prior to an initial Business Combination, and is restricted for use either in a Business Combination, to redeem Common Stock or for making tax payment. 9
Table of Contents In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” the Company has until February 2, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Company elected to take second extension, Sponsor deposited into the Trust Account $ 350,000
to extend the deadline from November 2, 2022, to February 2, 2023. . On January 27, 2023, IMAQ held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). As approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) which became effective upon filing. The Charter Amendment changed the date by which IMAQ must consummate an initial business combination for an additional three (3) months, from February 2, 2023 to May 2, 2023, with an ability to further extend by three (3) additional one (1) month periods until August 2, 2023 (the “Amended Combination Period”).  On February 3, 2023, third extension payment of $ 385,541
was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the  February 2, 2023, deadline to May 2, 2023.
If a Business Combination is not consummated by May 2, 2023, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, if a Business Combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 2, 2023. Management has determined that if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by May 2, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 2, 2023. Management plans to continue to draw down on its promissory notes, available for up to $ 235,000
out of $ 1,945,000
and repayable only if there is a Business Combination. The Company intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a prospective target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements.
Additionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company’s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company’s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. 10
Table of Contents The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022. The interim results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023, or for any future periods. Emerging Growth Company The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022. Investments Held in Trust Account As of December 31, 2022, the assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a) (16) of the Investment Company Act, with maturities of
180 days
or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities and generally have a readily determinable fair value, or a combination thereof. When the Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of U.S. government securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. When the Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of money market funds, the investments are recognized at fair value. Trading securities and investments in money market funds are presented on the condensed balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are reported in the statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. 11
Table of Contents Warrant Liability The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. In accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815, the Public Warrants qualify for equity treatment. The Private Warrants do not qualify as equity and are recorded as a liability at fair value. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Warrants (as defined in Note 4) was estimated using a Black-Scholes method (see Note 9). Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption All of the
23,000,000
Public Shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all redeemable Public Shares have been classified outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.
As of December 31, 2022, the redeemable common stock reflected in the condensed balance sheet are reconciled in the following table: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gross proceeds      $
230,000,000 Less: ​      Proceeds allocated to Public Warrants ​

( 209,237,593 ) Common stock subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2022 ​ ​
21,800,400 ​ Offering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A - Expenses of Offering. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction in equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately.
12
Table of Contents The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $ 15,242,385
as a result of the Initial Public Offering (consisting of $ 4,600,000
of underwriting fees, $ 8,050,000
of deferred underwriting fees, and $ 2,592,385
of other offering costs). The Company recorded $ 13,850,689
of offering costs as a reduction of temporary equity in connection with the Public Shares. The Company recorded $ 1,386,770
as a reduction of permanent equity in connection with the Public Warrants, Public Rights, Private Shares and Private Rights. The Company immediately expensed $ 4,926
of offering costs in connection with the Private Warrants that were classified as liabilities. ​ Share-Based Payment Arrangements The Company accounts for stock awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), which requires that all equity awards be accounted for at their fair value. Fair value is measured on the grant date and is equal to the underlying value of the stock. Costs equal to these fair values are recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the number of awards that are expected to vest, or in the period of grant for awards that vest immediately and have no future service condition. For awards that vest over time, cumulative adjustments in later periods are recorded to the extent actual forfeitures differ from the Company’s initial estimates; previously recognized compensation cost is reversed if the service or performance conditions are not satisfied, and the award is forfeited. Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 470”), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were
no
unrecognized tax benefits and
no
amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S federal jurisdiction and New Jersey. Our effective tax rate was - 5.29 % and
0.00 % for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and - 17.71 % and
0.00 % for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal and state statutory rate of
21 % and
9 % for the period ended December 31, 2022, due to the valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s net operating losses, changes in the fair value of warrant liability and state income taxes net of federal benefit. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination)
13
Table of Contents and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination. Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other stockholders, redeemable and non-redeemable common stock are presented as one class of stock in calculating net loss per share. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase an aggregate of
17,847,675
shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common stock (in dollars, except per share amounts):
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended ​ Nine Months Ended ​      December 31, 2022      December 31, 2021 Basic and diluted net loss per share: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Numerator: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss ​ $

( 0.02 ) ​ Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Company’s principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions based on market data and the entity’s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 14
Table of Contents The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheet for current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Level 1 — Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 — Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities. See Note 9 for additional information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. ​ ​ NOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING The registration statement filed in connection with the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on July 28, 2021. On August 2, 2021, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering of
20,000,000
Units, at $ 10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 200,000,000 . Each Unit consists of
one
share of common stock,
one
right (“Public Right”) and
one
redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right entitles the holder to receive one-twentieth of
one
share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase
three -fourths of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50
per whole share (see Note 7). On August 6, 2021, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase up to
3,000,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, the Company consummated the sale of an additional
3,000,000
Units, at $ 10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 30,000,000 . ​ NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of
714,400
Private Units at a price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit ($ 7,144,000
in the aggregate). Each Private Unit consists of
one
share of common stock (“Private Share”),
one
right (“Private Right”) and
one
warrant (“Private Warrant”). Each Private Right entitles the holder to receive
one-twentieth
of one share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase
three-fourths
of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50
per whole share (see Note 7). 15
Table of Contents The proceeds from the Private Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Units and all underlying securities will be worthless. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Private Rights and Private Warrants. Simultaneously with the closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional
82,500
Private Units at a price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $ 825,000 . ​ NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares On February 9, 2021, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $ 25,000
to cover certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for the issuance of
5,750,000
share of common stock (the “Founder Shares”). The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to
750,000
shares of common stock subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor would own, on an as-converted basis,
20 % of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (not including the Private Units and underlying securities and assuming the Sponsor did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering). On August 6, 2021, the underwriters’ exercised the over-allotment option in full, thus these shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Sponsor and the other holders of the Founder Shares (the “initial stockholders”) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until, with respect to  50 % of the Founder Shares, the earlier of six months after the date of the consummation of an initial Business Combination and the date on which the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $ 12.50

In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $ 1,500,000
of such loans may be convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $ 10.00  per unit at the option of the lender.

23,000,000
Public Warrants and
796,900
Private Warrants outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the completion of a Business Combination or (b)  one year  from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire
five years  after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. No Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within
90 days
from the consummation of an initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration the Securities Act. No Public Warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the shares of common stock have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the shares of common stock are not qualified or exempt
20
Table of Contents from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless. The Company may call the Public Warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $ 0.01
per warrant: ● at any time while the warrants are exercisable; ● upon not less than
30 days ’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; ● if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds
$ 16.50
per share, for any
20
trading days within a
30
trading day period ending on the
third
business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and ● if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire
30-day
trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the volume weighted average trading price of our common stock for the
20
trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Whether the Company will exercise its option to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis” will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of the Company’s shares of common stock at the time the warrants are called for redemption, the Company’s cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $ 9.50
per share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than
60 % of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of an initial Business Combination, and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s shares of common stock during the
20
trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates an initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Price”) is below $ 9.50
per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to
115 % of the Market Price, and the $ 16.50
per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to
165 % of the Market Price. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except the Private Units and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or salable until
30 days  after the completion of an initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Company accounts for the
23,796,900
warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option (including
23,000,000
Public Warrants and
796,900
Private Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. The Public Warrants qualify for equity treatment under ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the Private Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each Private Warrant must be recorded as a liability at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the Private Warrants as derivative liabilities at fair value upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and subsequently at the end of each reporting period. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to its current fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The Company will reassess the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification. ​ 21

— Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a Public Right will automatically receive one-twentieth ( 1/20 ) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of a Public Right converted all shares held by him, her or it in connection with a Business Combination or an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to its pre-Business Combination activities. In the event that the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of a Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-twentieth ( 1/20 ) of a share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware law. As a result, the holders of the rights must hold rights in multiples of

23,907 ​ The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes method to value the Private Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liability is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statement. On January 27, 2023, IMAQ held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). As approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) which became effective upon filing. The Charter Amendment changed the date by which IMAQ must consummate an initial business combination for an additional three (3) months, from February 2, 2023 to May 2, 2023, with an ability to further extend by three (3) additional one (1) month periods until August 2, 2023 (the “Amended Combination Period”). On February 3, 2023, third extension payment of $ 385,541
was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the  February 2, 2023, deadline to May 2, 2023. On January 26, 2023, International Media Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”),entered into a Loan and Transfer Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the “Loan Agreement”), by and among the Company, Content Creation Media, LLC (the “Sponsor”), and the lender named therein (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Sponsor is permitted to borrow $ 385,541
(the “Initial Loan”) and $ 128,513.70
per month, at the Company’s discretion (each a “Monthly Loan” and collectively with the Initial Loan, the “Loan”) which will in turn be loaned by the Sponsor to the Company, to cover certain extension payments to the trust account of the Company. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Loan shall be payable within five (5) days of the date on which Company consummates its de-SPAC transaction. 23
Table of Contents As additional consideration for the Lender making the Initial Loan available to Sponsor, the Company shall issue
500,000
shares of Common Stock to the Lender (the “Initial Securities”), and as additional consideration for the lender making each Monthly Loan available to Sponsor, the Company shall issue
166,700
shares of Common Stock to Lender for each Monthly Loan. Such securities shall be subject to no transfer restrictions or any other lock-up provisions, earn outs or other contingencies, and shall promptly be registered pursuant to the first registration statement filed by the Company or the surviving entity following the de-SPAC Closing in connection with the de-SPAC Closing, or if no such registration statement is filed in connection with the de-SPAC Closing, the first registration statement filed subsequent to the de-SPAC Closing, which will be filed no later than 45 days after the de-SPAC Closing and declared effective no later than 90 days after the de-SPAC Closing. The proceeds of the Loan will be used for the Company to fund amounts deposited into the Company’s trust account in connection with each extension. On February 14, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “February 2023 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate amount of up to $ 500,000
in four installments of (i) up to $ 150,000
no later than February 28, 2023, (ii) up to $ 200,000

The February 2023 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable promptly after the date on which the Company consummates an initial Business Combination. As of  December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, the amount outstanding on the February 2023 Promissory Note was $ 0
and $ 0
respectively. ​ ​ 24

Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes “forward-looking statements” that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “seek” and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management’s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company’s final prospectus for its Initial Public Offering (as defined below) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company’s filings with the SEC can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on January 15, 2021, in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report as our “initial business combination”. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) and the private placement of the Private Units (as defined below), the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial business combination: ● may significantly dilute the equity interest of our investors who would not have pre-emption rights in respect of any such issuance; ● may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock; ● could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; ● may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and ● may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock, rights and/or warrants. 25
Table of Contents ​ Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: ● default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; ● acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; ● our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; ● our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; ● using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; ● limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; ● increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; ● limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and ● other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. Stock Purchase Agreement
On October 22, 2022, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Risee Entertainment Holdings Private Limited, a company incorporated in India (the “Seller”), and Reliance Entertainment Studios Private Limited, company incorporated in India (the “Target Company”). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, a business combination between us and the Target Company will be effected by the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target Company from Seller in a series of transactions (collectively, the “Stock Acquisition”). Our board of directors has (i) approved and declared advisable the SPA and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the SPA and related transactions by our stockholders. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the SPA, the Seller will, in exchange for the consideration set forth in the SPA, sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver, all rights, title and interest in and to the shares of the Target Company (the “Company Shares”), free and clear of all liens, excepting only restrictions on the subsequent transfer of the Company Shares by us imposed under applicable laws, our organizational documents, and the shareholders’ agreement entered into in connection with the SPA. Such purchases will be made in four separate tranches as described in the SPA, with the final purchase to be made on or prior to 18 months from the initial closing. The aggregate purchase price for the Company Shares under the SPA is $102,000,000, and in addition, we also agreed to make a primary investment into the Target Company in the amount of $38,000,000. The SPA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties thereto. The consummation of the proposed Stock Acquisition is subject to certain conditions as further described in the SPA. Please see the Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on October 24, 2022 for additional information. 26
Table of Contents ​ Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from April 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022 were organizational activities, after IPO related to identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of $524,827, which resulted from franchise tax and income tax expense of $116,084, formation and operating costs of $592,277 and was offset by interest and dividend income on investments held in the trust account of $183,534. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $530,838, which resulted from formation and operating costs of $505,930, change in the fair value of our warrant liability of $39,845, and was offset by reversal of franchise tax $10,077 and interest and dividend income on investments held in the trust account of $4,860. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of $1,048,123, which resulted from franchise tax and income tax expense of $308,889, formation and operating costs of $1,720,979 and was offset in part by a change in the fair value of our warrant liability of $119,535 and interest and dividend income on investments held in the trust account of $862,210. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $1,880,881, which resulted from franchise tax and income tax expense of $131,293, formation and operating costs of $599,216, stock based compensation expense of $1,351,448, expensed offering cost of $4,926 and was offset in part by a change in the fair value of our warrant liability of $199,225, and interest and dividend income on investments held in the trust account of $6,777. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had $158,952 in our operating bank account available for working capital needs. All remaining cash was held in the trust account and is generally unavailable for our use prior to an initial business combination. On August 2, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Public Share”), one right (“Public Right”) and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right entitles the holder to receive one-twentieth of one share of common stock at the closing of our initial business combination. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase three-fourths of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 714,400 units (the “Private Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit ($7,144,000 in the aggregate). Each Private Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Private Share”), one right (“Private Right”) and one warrant (“Private Warrant”). Each Private Right entitles the holder to receive one-twentieth of one share of common stock at the closing of our initial business combination. Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase three-fourths of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. The proceeds from the Private Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering to be held in the trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if our time to complete a business combination is extended), the proceeds of the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Units and all underlying securities will be worthless. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the rights and warrants included in the Private Units. On August 6, 2021, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $30,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional 82,500 Private Units, at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $825,000. 27
Table of Contents ​ We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters in an amount equal to 3.5% ($8,050,000) of the total gross proceeds raised in the Initial Public Offering upon consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” the Company has until February 2, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Company elected to take second extension, Sponsor deposited into the Trust Account $350,000 to extend the deadline from November 2, 2022, to February 2, 2023. On January 27, 2023, IMAQ held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). As approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) which became effective upon filing. The Charter Amendment changed the date by which IMAQ must consummate an initial business combination for an additional three (3) months, from February 2, 2023 to May 2, 2023, with an ability to further extend by three (3) additional one (1) month periods until August 2, 2023 (the “Amended Combination Period”).  On February 3, 2023, third extension payment of $385,541 was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the  February 2, 2023, deadline to May 2, 2023. If a Business Combination is not consummated by May 2, 2023, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, if a Business Combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 2, 2023. Management has determined that if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by May 2, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 2, 2023. Management plans to continue to draw down on its promissory notes, available for up to $235,000 out of $1,945,000 and repayable only if there is a Business Combination. The Company intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. We believe that the $158,952 in our operating bank account as of December 31, 2022; promissory note, available for up to $235,000 out of $1,945,000, off balance sheet loan arrangement and commitment from sponsor to provide further loan as and when required, will be insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. Over this time period, we will be using these funds for  target business to consummate our initial business combination with and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $549,000 for accounting, audit and other third-party expenses attendant to the structuring and negotiation of a business combination; $318,500 for due diligence, consulting, travel and miscellaneous expenses incurred during search for initial business combination target; $385,000 SEC extension fee; $95,000 for franchise tax payment and approximately $45,000 for working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture
28
Table of Contents ​ of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. We may need to raise additional funds following the Initial Public Offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. Contractual Obligations Promissory Notes - Related Party On February 1, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “Initial Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we could borrow up to an aggregate of $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering. On April 6, 2021 and June 17, 2021, we issued additional unsecured promissory notes to the Sponsor (the “Additional Promissory Notes” and, together with the “Initial Promissory Note”, the “IPO Promissory Notes”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an additional aggregate principal amount of $200,000. The IPO Promissory Notes were non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding balance under the Promissory Notes was repaid on August 6, 2021. On January 14, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “Post-IPO Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we could borrow up to an aggregate of $500,000 in two installments of (i) up to $300,000 during the month of March 2022, and (ii) up to $200,000 during the month of June 2022 at our discretion. The Post-IPO Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable promptly after the date on which we consummate an initial business combination. On March 29, 2022, we amended and restated the Post-IPO Promissory Note, such that the aggregate amount we can borrow at our discretion under the note increased from $500,000 in two installments as described above, to up to $750,000 in three installments of (i) up to $195,000 no later than February 28, 2022, (ii) up to $355,000 no later than April 30, 2022, and (iii) up to $200,000 no later than June 30, 2022. No other terms were amended pursuant to this amendment and restatement. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the amount outstanding on the promissory note was $750,000 and $195,000 respectively. On August 10, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “August 2022 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate of $895,000 in three installments of (i) up to $195,000 no later than July 31, 2022, (ii) up to $500,000 no later than October 31, 2022, and (iii) up to $200,000 no later than January 31, 2023 at the Company’s discretion.

Table of Contents ​ Underwriting Agreement On July 28, 2021, in connection with the Initial Public Offering, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, as representative of the underwriters named therein. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, or $4,600,000 in the aggregate, upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and full exercise of the over-allotment option. In addition, $0.35 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, or $8,050,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Right of First Refusal Subject to certain conditions, we granted Chardan, the representative of the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering, for a period of 18 months after the date of the consummation of our business combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager, with at least 30% of the economics, for any and all future public and private equity and debt offerings. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(E)(i), such right of first refusal shall not have a duration of more than three years from the effective date of the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering. Chief Financial Officer Agreement On February 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Vishwas Joshi to act as our Chief Financial Officer for a period of twenty-four months from the date of listing of the Company on NASDAQ.

Consulting Agreements We have engaged Ontogeny Capital L T D (“Ontogeny”) to act as a management consulting and corporate advisor in the preparation of corporate strategies, management support and business plans for us. We paid Ontogeny $40,000 at the time of signing the engagement agreement and $35,000 upon the filing of the registration statement relating to the Initial Public Offering. We paid Ontogeny an aggregate of $1,650,000 upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. In addition, upon the consummation of our initial business combination, we have agreed to pay Ontogeny $2,875,000 for certain management consulting and corporate advisory services. On September 17, 2021, we entered into a consulting agreement, effective as of September 1, 2021, with F.

Table of Contents ​ Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other stockholders, redeemable and non-redeemable common stock are presented as one class of stock in calculating net loss per share. We have not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase an aggregate of 17,847,675 shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. Warrant Liability We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption All of the 23,000,000 Public Shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with our liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial business combination and in connection with certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within our control require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all redeemable Public Shares have been classified outside of permanent equity.
We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. Share Based Payment Arrangements On July 7, 2021, the Sponsor entered into agreements with two independent directors to transfer 95,000 Founder Shares to each director, subject to and upon closing of our initial business combination. As such, under ASC 718, these shares are transferred subject to a performance condition and compensation expense will be recognized at the date of a business combination when earned. On July 22, 2021, the Sponsor sold 30,000 of its Founder Shares to each of its five independent directors (the “Directors”) (or 150,000 Founder Shares in total) for cash consideration of approximately $0.004 per share. These awards are subject to ASC 718. In accordance with ASC 718, the Company recognized compensation expense in an amount equal to the number of Founders Shares sold times the grant date fair value per share less the amount initially received for the purchase of the Founders Shares. The value of the Founder Shares sold to the Directors was determined to be $787,500 as of July 22, 2021. As such, the Company recognized compensation expense of $786,848 within stock-based compensation expense in the Company’s Statements of Operations for the period from January 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021. 32

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2022, due to the previously reported material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company’s accounting for complex financial instruments and stock-based compensation. We also have a material weakness in our internal control surrounding the review of accounts payable and accrued expenses to ensure expense recognition in the proper period. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting except as described below. 33
Table of Contents ​ As previously disclosed, management has identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting for our complex financial instruments (including redeemable equity instruments as described above) and stock-based compensation. We also have a material weakness in our internal control surrounding the review of accounts payable and accrued expenses to ensure expense recognition in the proper period. In light of the material weakness identified, although we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to continue to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.
