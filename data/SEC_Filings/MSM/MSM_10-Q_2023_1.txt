 the retention of qualified sales and customer service personnel and metalworking specialists;  the risk of loss of key suppliers or contractors or key brands or supply chain disruptions, including due to import restrictions or global geopolitical conditions;  changes to governmental trade or sanctions policies, including the impact from significant import restrictions or tariffs or moratoriums on economic activity with certain countries or regions;  risks related to opening or expanding our customer fulfillment centers;  our ability to estimate the cost of healthcare claims incurred under our self-insurance plan;  litigation risk due to the nature of our business;  risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or other strategic transactions;  financial restrictions on outstanding borrowings;  our ability to maintain our credit facilities or incur additional borrowings on terms we deem attractive;  the interest rate uncertainty due to the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) reform;
 the failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and other laws applicable to our business;  the outcome of government or regulatory proceedings or future litigation;  goodwill and intangible assets recorded resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired;  our common stock price may be volatile due to factors outside of our control; and  the significant control that our principal shareholders exercise over us, which may result in our taking actions or failing to take actions which our other shareholders do not prefer.

5 MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO., INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollar amounts and shares in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited)
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by the management of MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest, “MSC Industrial” or the “Company”) and in the opinion of management include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of
December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022 and
results of operations and cash flows for the thirteen weeks ended
December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 . The financial information as of September 3, 2022 was derived from the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2022.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Company, however, believes that the disclosures contained in this Report comply with the requirements of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2022.
Fiscal Year
The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to August 31 st
of each year. References to “fiscal year 2023” refer to the period from September 4, 2022 to September 2, 2023, which is a 52-week fiscal year. References to “fiscal year 2022” refer to the period from August 29, 2021 to September 3, 2022, which was a 53-week fiscal year. The fiscal quarters ended December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 refer to the thirteen weeks ended as of those dates.
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Impact of Economic Trends
The United States economy has experienced and continues to experience disruptions in the supply of certain products and services and tight conditions in the labor market. These disruptions and conditions have contributed to an inflationary environment which, while falling, remains elevated and has affected the price and, at times, the availability of certain products and services necessary for the Company’s operations, including fuel, labor and certain products the Company sells or the inputs for such products. Such disruptions and conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact in the future, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a result of recent high inflation and elevated freight, labor and fuel costs, as well as periodic supply chain disruptions, the Company has implemented price realization strategies in response to increased costs the Company faces. Furthermore, in light of disruptions to availability and increased or uncertain shipping times, the Company is maintaining higher purchasing levels than it did prior to its fiscal year 2020 in order to ensure sufficient inventory supply to meet customer demand.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which provides for additional annual disclosures and added transparency for entities which receive government assistance. This includes disclosure of the type of government assistance received, the entity’s method of accounting, and the impact on the entity’s financial statements. This guidance is for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance was adopted by the Company for fiscal year 2023 and will be applied prospectively. The Company anticipates annual disclosures within the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 related to the Employee Retention Credit (the “ERC”) provision provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”).
Other pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .   Note 2. Revenue
Revenue Recognition
Net sales include product revenue and shipping and handling charges, net of estimated sales returns and any related sales incentives. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts have a single performance obligation, to deliver products, and are short-term in nature. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations under the contract, and invoicing occurs at approximately the same point in time. The Company recognizes revenue once the customer obtains control of the products. The Company’s product sales have standard payment terms that do not exceed
one year . The Company considers shipping and handling as activities to fulfill its performance obligations. The Company estimates product returns based on historical return rates. Total accrued sales returns were $ 7,469
and $ 7,198
as of December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022, respectively, and are reported as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sales taxes and value-added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.
Consideration Payable to Customers
The Company offers customers sales incentives, which primarily consist of volume rebates, and upfront sign-on payments. These volume rebates and sign-on payments are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and result in a reduction of net sales from the goods transferred to the customer at the later of when the related revenue is recognized or when the Company promises to pay the consideration. The Company estimates its volume rebate accruals and records its sign-on payments based on various factors, including contract terms, historical experience, and performance levels. Total accrued sales incentives, primarily related to volume rebates, were $ 27,277
and $ 25,274
as of December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022, respectively, and are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sign-on payments, not yet recognized as a reduction of revenue, are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $ 1,903
and $ 2,210
as of December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022, respectively.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
The Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events other than the passage of time. The Company records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligations. The Company did
no t have material contract assets or liabilities as of December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The Company operates in
one
operating and reportable segment as a distributor of
metalworking and maintenance, repair and operations
products and services. The Company serves a large number of customers in diverse industries, which
7 MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT CO., INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollar amounts and shares in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited)
are subject to different economic and industry factors. The Company’s presentation of net sales by customer end-market most reasonably depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of Company revenue and cash flows are affected by economic and industry factors. The Company does not disclose net sales information by product category as it is impracticable to do so as a result of its numerous product offerings and the way its business is managed.
The following table presents the Company’s percentage of net sales by customer end-market for the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021:

Note 3. Net Income per Share
Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and the Company’s Class B Common Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share (“Class B Common Stock” and, together with Class A Common Stock, “Common Stock”), outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period, including potentially dilutive shares of Common Stock equivalents outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of potential shares of Common Stock is determined using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share under the treasury stock method for the
thirteen weeks ended
December 3, 2022
and November 27 , 2021.

Potentially dilutive securities attributable to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share when the combined exercise price and average unamortized fair value are greater than the average market price of Class A Common Stock, and, therefore, their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for all stock-based payments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation,” as amended.

Performance Share Units
In fiscal year 2020, the Company began granting performance share units (“PSUs”) as part of its long-term stock-based compensation program. PSUs cliff vest after a
three year
performance period based on the achievement of specific performance goals as set forth in the applicable award agreement. Based on the extent to which the performance goals are achieved, vested shares may range from
0 % to
200 % of the target award amount.

PSU adjustment represents the net PSUs awarded above or below their target grants resulting from the achievement of performance goals above or below the performance targets established at grant. One grant goal was achieved at
116 % of its target based on fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2022 financial results. (2)
Excludes approximately
8
shares of accrued incremental dividend equivalent rights on outstanding PSUs granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
The fair value of each PSU is the closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) of Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
PSUs are expensed over the three year performance period of each respective grant. Forfeitures of share-based awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting PSU forfeitures and records stock-based compensation expense only for PSU awards that are expected to vest.
Upon vesting, subject to the achievement of specific performance goals, a portion of the PSU award may be withheld to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation, and the remaining PSUs will be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock. These awards accrue dividend equivalents on the underlying PSUs (in the form of additional stock units) based on dividends declared on Class A Common Stock and these dividend equivalents are paid to the award recipient in the form of unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock on the vesting dates of the underlying PSUs, subject to the same performance vesting requirements.
The
unrecognized
stock-based compensation cost related to the PSUs at December 3, 2022 was $ 7,700
and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.2
years.

Forfeitures of share-based awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting RSU forfeitures and records stock-based compensation expense only for RSU awards that are expected to vest. Upon vesting, a portion of the RSU award may be withheld to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation, and the remaining RSUs will be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock. These awards accrue dividend equivalents on the underlying RSUs (in the form of additional stock units) based on dividends declared on Class A Common Stock and these dividend equivalents are paid to the award recipient in the form of unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock on the vesting dates of the underlying RSUs. The dividend equivalents are not included in the RSU table above.
The unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to the RSUs at December 3, 2022 was $ 34,534
and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

years.

Note 5. Fair Value
Fair value accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The below fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, with Level 1 being of the highest priority. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
Level 1 — Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets .
Level 2 — Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and outstanding indebtedne ss.
Cash and cash equivalents include
investments in a money market fund which are reported at fair value. The fair value of money market funds is determined using quoted prices for identical investments in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.
The Company uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its debt instruments, utilizing quoted prices in active markets , interest rates and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar instruments. Therefore, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The reported carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments approximated their fair values as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021.
During the thirteen-week periods ended
December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 , the Company had
no
material remeasurements of non-financial assets or liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.

Amended Revolving Credit Facility
In April 2017, the Company entered into a $ 600,000
revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended and extended in August 2021 (as amended, the “Amended Revolving Credit Facility”). The Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on
August 24, 2026 , provides for a
five year
unsecured revolving loan facility on a committed basis. The interest rate for borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is based on either LIBOR or a base rate, plus a spread based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal reporting quarter. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility also includes
procedures for the succession from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate.
Depending on the interest period the Company selects, interest may be payable every one, two or three months. Interest is reset at the end of each interest period. The Company currently elects to have loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility bear interest based on LIBOR with one-month interest periods.
The Amended Revolving Credit Facility permits up to $ 50,000
to be used to fund letters of credit. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility also permits the Company to request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or to increase the revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 300,000 . Subject to certain limitations, each such incremental term loan facility or revolving loan commitment increase will be on terms as agreed to by the Company, the administrative agent and the lenders providing such financing. Outstanding letters of credit were $ 5,269
at
both December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022.
Uncommitted Credit Facilities
During fiscal year 2022, the Company amended and extended all three of its uncommitted credit facilities. All three of these amendments implemented the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark. These facilities (collectively, the “Uncommitted Credit Facilities” and, together with the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) total $ 208,000
in aggregate maximum uncommitted availability, under which $ 200,000
was outstanding at both December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022, and is included in the Current portion of debt including obligations under finance leases on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facilities are due at the end of the applicable interest period, which is typically one month but may be up to six months and may be rolled over to a new interest period at the option of the applicable lender. The Company’s lenders have, in the past, been willing to roll over the principal amount outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facilities at the end of each interest period but may not do so in the future. Each Uncommitted Credit Facility matures within
one year
of entering into such Uncommitted Credit Facility and contains certain limited covenants which are substantially the same as the limited covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. All of the Uncommitted Credit Facilities are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured indebtedness.
Because the interest rates on the Uncommitted Credit Facilities have recently been lower than the interest rates which are available on the Company’s other sources of financing, the Company has used, and intends to use in the future, the Uncommitted Credit Facilities for opportunistic refinancing of the Company’s existing indebtedness. The Company does not presently view the Uncommitted Credit Facilities as sources of incremental debt financing of the Company due to the uncommitted nature of the Uncommitted Credit Facilities, but reserves the right to use the Uncommitted Credit Facilities to incur additional debt where it considers it appropriate under the then-existing credit market conditions.
During the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022 , the Company borrowed an aggregate $ 84,000
and repaid an aggregate $ 99,000
under the Credit Facilities.
As of December 3, 2022 and September 3, 2022, the weighted-average interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facilities were  4.93 % and
3.42 %, respectively.
Private Placement Debt
In July 2016, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $ 75,000
aggregate principal amount of
2.65 % Senior Notes, Series A, due
July 28, 2023 , and $ 100,000

2.90 % Senior Notes, Series B, due
July 28,

aggregate principal amount of
3.79 % Senior Notes, due
June 11, 2025 ; and, in March 2020, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $ 50,000
aggregate principal amount of
2.60 % Senior Notes, due
March 5, 2027
(collectively, the “Private Placement Debt”). Interest is payable semiannually at the fixed stated interest rates. All of the Private Placement Debt is unsecured.
Shelf Facility Agreements
In January 2018, the Company entered into Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreements with MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC (the “MetLife Note Purchase Agreement”) and PGIM, Inc. (the “Prudential Note Purchase Agreement” and, together with the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, the “Shelf Facility Agreements”). Each of the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and the Prudential Note Purchase Agreement provides for an uncommitted facility for the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate total of $ 250,000
of unsecured senior notes, at a fixed rate. Pursuant to the terms of the Shelf Facility Agreements, no new unsecured senior notes may be issued and sold after January 12, 2021. As of December 3, 2022, $ 50,000
aggregate principal amount of
3.04 % Senior Notes, due
January 12, 2023
(which
is
included in the Current portion of debt including obligations under finance leases on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 3, 2022), and $ 50,000
aggregate principal amount of
2.40 % Series 2019A Notes, due
March 5, 2024 , were outstanding under notes issued in private placements pursuant to the Shelf Facility Agreements .
Covenants
Each of the Credit Facilities, the Private Placement Debt and the Shelf Facility Agreements imposes several restrictive covenants, including the requirement that the Company maintain (i) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) of no more than
3.00
to 1.00 (or, at the election of the Company after it consummates a material acquisition, a four-quarter temporary increase to
3.50
to 1.00) and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense of at least
3.00
to 1.00, during the terms of the Credit Facilities, the Private Placement Debt and the Shelf Facility Agreements.
As of December 3, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the operating and financial covenants of the Credit Facilities, the Private Placement Debt and the Shelf Facility Agreements.
Note 7. Shareholders’ Equity
Common Stock Repurchases and Treasury Stock
On June 29, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated the MSC Stock Repurchase Plan, which was established during fiscal year 1999, and authorized a new share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) to purchase up to
5,000
shares of Class A Common Stock. There is no expiration date for the Share Repurchase Program. As of
December 3, 2022 , the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may yet be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program was
4,519
shares. The Share Repurchase Program allows the Company to repurchase shares at any time and in any increments it deems appropriate in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended .
During the thirteen-week period ended
December 3, 2022,
the Company repurchased
233
shares of Class A Common Stock for $ 18,539 . From this total,
181
shares were immediately retired and
52
shares were repurchased by the Company to satisfy the Company’s associates’ tax withholding liability associated with its stock-based compensation program and are reflected at cost as treasury stock in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022. During the thirteen-week period ended
November 27, 2021,
the Company repurchased
53
shares of Class A Common Stock for $ 4,559 .
All of these shares were repurchased by the Company to satisfy the Company’s associates’ tax withholding liability associated with its stock-based compensation program and are reflected at cost as treasury stock in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2021.
The Company reissued 14 shares of Class A treasury stock during both the thirteen-week periods ended December 3, 2022 and

Note 8. Restructuring and Other Costs ‎ Optimization of Company Operations and Profitability Improvement
The Company identified opportunities for improvements in its workforce realignment, strategy and staffing, and increased its focus on performance management, to ensure it has the right skillsets and number of associates to execute its long-term vision. As such, the Company extended voluntary and involuntary severance and separation benefits to certain associates in order to facilitate its workforce realignment. In addition, the Company engaged consultants to assist in reviewing the optimization of the Company’s operations and improving profitability with executing on its Company-wide initiative, referred to as Mission Critical, through fiscal year 2023.

The Company generally offers a maximum
one year
warranty, including parts and labor, for certain of its products sold. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. The Company may be able to recoup some of these costs through product warranties it holds with the original equipment manufacturers, which typically range from
30
to
90 day s. In general, many of the Company’s general merchandise products are covered by third-party original equipment manufacturers’ warranties. The Company’s warranty expense for the thirteen-week periods ended December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 was immaterial.

Note 10. Income Taxes
During the thirteen-week period ended
December 3, 2022, there were
no
material changes in unrecognized tax benefits.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which is intended to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (the “ARPA”) was signed into law. The ARPA includes several provisions, such as measures that extend and expand the ERC provision, previously enacted under the CARES Act, through December 31, 2021. The Company has filed a refund claim in connection with the ERC and will account for the potential ERC refund, if any, upon Internal Revenue Service approval and receipt.
The CARES Act provides for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security payroll taxes. The Company elected to defer the employer-paid portion of social security payroll taxes through December 31, 2020 of $ 18,887 . Of this amount, half was remitted in December 2021 and the remaining half was remitted in December 2022.
The Company’s effective tax rate was
24.7 % for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to
23.5 % for the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2021.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation.
Note 11. Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, there are various claims, lawsuits and pending actions against the Company incidental to the operation of its business. Although the outcome of these matters, both individually and in aggregate, is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Note 12. Subsequent Events
On December 19, 2022, the Company and two of its subsidiaries entered into an arrangement with certain financial institutions, pursuant to which such financial institutions will purchase existing and future trade receivables and certain related
rights
from one of the subsidiaries (the “Receivables Facility”). The Receivables Facility is a committed senior secured revolving trade receivables facility in an initial aggregate amount of $ 300,000 . Amounts purchased under the Receivables Facility will be priced at one-month term SOFR plus a margin.
During December 2022, proceeds from the Receivables Facility were used to pay down $ 230,000
on the Amended Revolving
Credit
Facility and $ 40,000

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is intended to update the information contained in MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc.’s (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest, “MSC,” “MSC Industrial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2022 and presumes that readers have access to, and will have read, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Part II of such Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
MSC is a leading North American distributor of a broad range of metalworking and maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) products and services. We help our customers drive greater productivity, profitability and growth with inventory management and other supply chain solutions and deep expertise from more than 80 years of working with customers across industries. We offer approximately 2.2 million active, saleable SKUs through our catalogs; our brochures; our eCommerce channels, including our website,
www.mscdirect.com
(the “MSC website”); our inventory management solutions; and our customer care centers, customer fulfillment centers, regional inventory centers and warehouses.
We service our customers from   six   customer fulfillment centers ,
10 regional inventory centers   and  38  warehouses. We
continue to implement our strategies to gain market share, generate new customers, increase sales to existing customers, and diversify our customer base.
Our business model focuses on providing overall procurement cost reduction and just-in-time delivery to meet our customers’ needs. Many of our products are carried in stock, and orders for these in-stock products are typically fulfilled the day on which the order is received.
We focus on offering inventory, process and procurement solutions that reduce MRO supply chain costs and improve plant floor productivity for our customers. We will seek to continue to achieve cost reductions throughout our business through cost-saving strategies and increased leverage from our existing infrastructure, and to continue to provide additional procurement cost-saving solutions to our customers through technology such as our Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) systems, vendor-managed inventory (“VMI”) systems and vending programs. Our field sales and service associate headcount was 2,545 at December 3, 2022, compared to 2,445 at November 27, 2021.
Highlights
Highlights during the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022 include the following:
 We generated $76.0 million of cash from operations, compared to $57.8 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
 We had net repayments of $15.0 million on our credit facilities, compared to net repayments of $24.0 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year.    We paid out an aggregate $44.2 million in regular cash dividends. Due to the timing of the payable date, no cash dividends were paid during the same period in the prior fiscal year.
 We repurchased and immediately retired $14.3 million of MSC’s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”).
 We incurred $2.1 million in restructuring and other costs, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Restructuring and other costs primarily include consulting-related costs associated with the optimization of the Company’s operations and associate severance and separation costs. Restructuring and other costs for the same period in the prior fiscal year also include equity award acceleration costs associated with severance and other exit-related costs.
Recent Developments
Progress on Mission Critical
As previously disclosed, we initiated a company-wide project in fiscal year 2020, which we refer to as “Mission Critical,” to accelerate market share capture and improve profitability over the period through fiscal year 2023. Among the Mission Critical initiatives to realize growth, we began and expect to continue investing in our market-leading metalworking business by adding to our metalworking specialist team, introducing value-added services to our customers, expanding our vending, VMI and in-plant solutions programs, building out our sales force, and diversifying our customers and end-markets. We also are focusing on improving profitability through the implementation of various pricing strategies and critical
16
structural cost reductions in order to improve return on invested capital. Cost reductions will be comprised of savings in the areas of sales and service, supply chain and general and administrative expenses, and will include initiatives to optimize our distribution center network and real estate footprint, renegotiate supplier contracts, and redesign our talent acquisition and retention approach.
Impact of Economic Trends
The United States economy has experienced and continues to experience disruptions in the supply of certain products and services and tight conditions in the labor market. These disruptions and conditions have contributed to an inflationary environment which, while falling, remains elevated and has affected the price and, at times, the availability of certain products and services necessary for the Company’s operations, including fuel, labor and certain products the Company sells or the inputs for such products. Such disruptions and conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact in the future, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a result of recent high inflation and elevated freight, labor and fuel costs, as well as periodic supply chain disruptions, the Company has implemented price realization strategies in response to increased costs the Company faces. Furthermore, in light of disruptions to availability and increased or uncertain shipping times, the Company is maintaining higher purchasing levels than it did prior to its fiscal year 2020 in order to ensure sufficient inventory supply to meet customer demand.
Our Strategy
Our primary objective is to grow sales profitably while offering our customers highly technical and high-touch solutions to solve their most complex challenges on the plant floor. Our strategy is to complete the transition from being a spot-buy supplier to a mission-critical partner to our customers. We will selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that expand or complement our business in new and existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we provide.
Business Environment
We utilize various indices when evaluating the level of our business activity, including the Industrial Production (“IP”) index. Approximately 69% of our revenues came from sales in the manufacturing sector during the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022. Through statistical analysis, we have found that trends in our customers’ activity have correlated to changes in the IP index. The IP index measures short-term changes in industrial production. Growth in the IP index from month to month indicates growth in the manufacturing, mining and utilities industries. T he IP index over the three months ended November 2022 and the average for the three- and 12-month periods ended November 2022 were as follows:
Period
IP Index September
104.8 October
104.7 November
104.5
Fiscal year 2023 Q1 average
104.7 12-month average
103.8
The average IP index for the three months ended December 3, 2022 of 104.7 improved from the adjusted average from the prior quarter of 104.3, indicating continued growth in key industries and end-markets from the lower levels seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in calendar year 2021 and continuing through calendar year 2022, the United States economy has experienced supply chain disruptions and significant levels of inflation, which have included higher prices for labor, freight, fuel and the products that the Company sells. The Company has implemented price realization strategies in response to increased costs the Company faces. We will continue to monitor the current economic conditions for the impact
on our customers and markets and assess both risks and opportunities that may affect our business and operations.

Net Sales
Net sales increased 12.9%, or $109.2 million, to $957.7 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $848.5 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The $109.2 million increase in net sales was comprised of $56.1 million from improved pricing, inclusive of changes in customer and product mix, discounting and other items, $26.8 million of higher sales volume, and $29.1 million of net sales from
fiscal year 2022 acquisitions, partially offset by $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact . Of the $109.2 million increase in net sales during the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, national account customer sales increased by $42.2 million, sales to our core and other customers increased by $24.3 million, sales to our government customers increased by $13.6 million and sales from fiscal year 2022 acquisitions were $29.1 million.
The table below shows, among other things, the change in our average daily sales (“ADS”) by total Company and by customer type for the thirteen-week periods ended December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year:

We believe that our ability to transact business with our customers directly through the MSC website as well as through various
other
electronic portals gives us a competitive advantage over smaller suppliers. Sales made through our eCommerce platforms, including sales made through EDI systems, VMI systems, Extensible Markup Language ordering-based systems, vending, hosted systems and other electronic portals, represented 61.9% of consolidated net sales for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to 60.4% of consolidated net sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year. These percentages of consolidated net sales do not include eCommerce sales from our recent acquisitions.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $397.8 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022 increased $45.2 million, or 12.8%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit margin was 41.5% for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to 41.6% for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
The increase in gross profit was primarily a result of a higher sales level as described above and improved price realization and positive spread between sales price and cost of goods sold. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the margins of our recent acquisitions.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased 9.0%, or $23.1 million, to $279.7 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $256.6 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses were 29.2% of net sales for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to 30.2% for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in Operating expenses was primarily attributable to our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and higher payroll and payroll-related costs, as well as higher freight expense. The decline in Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was related to our cost savings programs and productivity improvements resulting from our Mission Critical initiatives.
Payroll and payroll-related costs for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022 we re 56.2% o f total Operating expenses, as compared to 57.0% for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Payroll
and payroll-related costs, which include salary, incentive compensation, sales commission, and fringe benefit costs, increased $11.0 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022. The majority of this increase compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was due to salary and sales commission costs.
Freight expense was $40.5 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $36.2 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The primary drivers of the increase in freight expense were increased sales volume and
higher fuel-related charges.
Restructuring and Other Costs
We incurred $2.1 million in restructuring and other costs for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $5.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. These charges primarily include consulting-related costs associated with the optimization of the Company’s operations and associate severance and separation costs. Restructuring and other costs for the same period in the prior fiscal year also include
e quity award acceleration costs associated with severance and other exit-related costs .
See Note 8, “Restructuring and Other Costs” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income from Operations
Income from operations increased 27.9%, or $25.3 million, to $116.0 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $90.7 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.1% for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to 10.7% for the same period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily attributable to overall increases in sales and gross margin and an improvement in the ratio of operating expenses to sales during the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022.
Total Other Expense
Total other expense increased 97.9%, or $4.0 million, to $8.2 million for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to $4.1 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on our credit facilities and a higher average debt balance on our committed credit facility.
19
Provision for Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate was 24.7% for the thirteen-week period ended
December 3, 2022 , as compared to 23.5% for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation.
Net Income
The factors which affected net income for the thirteen-week period ended December 3, 2022, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, have been discussed above.

As of December 3, 2022, we had $26.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, substantially all with well-known financial institutions.
Historically, our primary financing needs have been to fund our working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth and the costs of acquisitions, new products, new facilities, facility expansions, investments in vending solutions, technology investments, and productivity investments. Cash generated from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities and net proceeds from the private placement notes, have been used to fund these needs, to repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock from time to time, and to pay dividends to our shareholders.
As of December 3, 2022, total borrowings outstanding, representing amounts due under our credit facilities and notes, as well as all finance leases and financing arrangements, were $780.1 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.3 million, as compared to total borrowings of $794.6 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.4 million, as of the end of fiscal year 2022. The decrease was driven by higher net repayments on our committed credit facility. See Note 6, “Debt” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these balances.
We believe, based on our current business plan, that our existing cash, financial resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to changes in macroeconomic conditions, including variations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices, labor and supply costs, inflation, and interest rates, and to take appropriate action as it is warranted.

Cash Flows from Operating
Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $76.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022, compared to $57.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the following:
 an increase in net income as described above;
20
 a decrease in the change in accounts receivable primarily due to prior fiscal year increases in accounts receivable attributable to changes in prior fiscal year sales volume;  an increase in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities from increased inventory purchases; partially offset by
 an increase in the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets attributable to the receivables related to vendor rebate programs and an increase in the change in inventory.

Working Capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (2)
Current Ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. (3)
Days’ Sales Outstanding is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by net sales, using trailing two months sales data. (4)
Inventory Turnover is calculated by dividing total cost of goods sold by inventory, using a 13-month trailing average inventory.
Working capital and current ratio as of December 3, 2022 remained consistent when compared to September 3, 2022. The slight increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories and receivables related to vendor rebate programs. Working capital as of December 3, 2022 increased compared to November 27, 2021, primarily due to
increases in both accounts receivable and inventories. The current ratio as of December 3, 2022 declined slightly compared to November 27, 2021, primarily due to
the increase in the current portion of debt.
Days’ sales outstanding as of December 3, 2022 remained comparable to September 3, 2022. The increase in days’ sales outstanding as of December 3, 2022 compared to November 27, 2021 was primarily due to the receivables portfolio consisting of a greater percentage of our national account program sales, which typically have longer payment terms.
Inventory turnover as of December 3, 2022 remained comparable to both September 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the thirteen-week periods ended
December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021
was $25.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively. The use of cash for both periods was primarily due to expenditures for property, plant and equipment mainly related to Mission Critical projects.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $68.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022, compared to $19.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, primarily due to the following:
 $44.2 million of regular cash dividends paid during the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022, compared to no dividends paid during the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021 (dividend declared on October 14, 2021 was paid on November 30, 2021);
 net repayments of $15.0 million on our credit facilities during the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022, compared to net repayments of $24.0 million on our credit facilities during the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021; and  $18.5 million in aggregate repurchases of Class A Common Stock during the thirteen weeks ended December 3, 2022, compared to $4.6 million in aggregate repurchases of Class A Common Stock during the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021.
21
Capital Expenditures
We continue to invest in sales productivity initiatives, eCommerce and vending platforms, customer fulfillment centers and distribution network, and other infrastructure and technology.
Debt
Credit Facilities
In April 2017, the Company entered into a $600.0 million revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended and extended in August 2021.
As of December 3, 2022, the Company also had three uncommitted credit facilities,
totaling $208.0 million of aggregate maximum uncommitted availability .
See Note 6, “Debt”   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about   our credit facilities.
As of December 3, 2022, we were in compliance with the operating and financial covenants of our credit facilities. The current unused balance of $564.7 million from the revolving credit facility, which is reduced by outstanding letters of credit, is available for working capital purposes if necessary. See Note 6, “Debt” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these balances.
Private Placement Debt
and Shelf Facility Agreements
In July 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of unsecured senior notes. In January 2018, we entered into two note purchase and private shelf facility agreements (together, the “Shelf Facility Agreements”). In June 2018 and March 2020, we entered into additional note purchase agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Shelf Facility Agreements, no new unsecured senior notes were sold after January 12, 2021. See Note 6, “Debt” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these transactions.
Leases and Financing Arrangements
As of December 3, 2022, certain of our operations were conducted on leased premises. These leases are for varying periods, the longest extending to fiscal year 2031. In addition, we are obligated under certain equipment and automobile operating and finance leases, which expire on varying dates through fiscal year 2026.
From time to time, we enter into financing arrangements
with vendors to purchase certain information technology equipment or software .
Critical Accounting Estimates
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, allowance for credit losses, warranty reserves, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, and accounting for goodwill and long-lived assets. We make estimates, judgments and assumptions in determining the amounts reported in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are used to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenues and expenses reported that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the Company’s critical accounting policies, as disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2022.
