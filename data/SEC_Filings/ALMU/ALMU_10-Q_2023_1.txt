Note
1 – The Company
Aeluma
is headquartered in Goleta, California. The Company is engaged in the research and development of infrared (IR) optical sensors to disrupt
the market for IR sensors, and using its proprietary technology aims to produce a much higher performance alternative to today’s
low-cost sensors at much lower prices than would otherwise be possible. The focus of the Company will be the image sensor market. Initial
efforts hope to penetrate the 3D imaging and sensing (mobile and consumer, defense and aerospace, industrial, medical, auto) and LiDAR
(robotic vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems vehicles (ADAS), topography, wind, industrial) markets.
We
were originally incorporated as Parc Investments, Inc. in the State of Delaware on August 21, 2020. Prior to the Merger (as defined
below), we were a “shell company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)).
On
June 22, 2021, our board of directors and all of our pre-Merger stockholders approved a restated certificate of incorporation, which
was effective upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 22, 2021 and through which we changed
our name to “Aeluma, Inc.” On June 22, 2021, our board of directors also adopted restated bylaws.
On
June 22, 2021, Biond Photonics, Inc., a privately held California corporation (“Biond Photonics”) merged with and into
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Aeluma Operating Co., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on June 22, 2021 (“Acquisition
Sub”). Pursuant to this transaction (the “Merger”), Acquisition Sub was the surviving corporation and remained our
whollyowned subsidiary, and all the outstanding stock of Biond Photonics was converted into shares of our common stock.
As
a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of Biond Photonics and continued the existing business operations of Biond Photonics
as a public reporting company under the name Aeluma, Inc. In conjunction with the merger transaction, the company changed its year end
to June 30. Biond Photonics was incorporated in February 2019.
Merger
Agreement
On
June 22, 2021, Parc Investments, Inc., Acquisition Sub and Biond Photonics entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
(the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on June 22, 2021 (the “Closing Date”),
Biond Photonics merged with and into Acquisition Sub, with Acquisition Sub continuing as the surviving corporation and our wholly-owned
subsidiary.
As
a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of Biond Photonics, a California corporation, doing business as Aeluma. At the time
the certificates of merger reflecting the Merger were filed with the Secretaries of State of California and Delaware (the “Effective
Time”), each of Biond Photonics’ shares of capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger
was converted into the right to receive (a)
1.299135853
shares of our common stock (the “Common Share Conversion Ratio”),
with the maximum number of shares of our common stock issuable to the former holders of Biond Photonics’ capital stock equal to
4,100,000
after adjustments due to rounding for fractional shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, an aggregate of
2,500,000
shares of our common stock owned by our stockholders prior to the Merger were forfeited and cancelled (the “Stock Forfeiture”).
The
issuance of shares of our common stock to Biond Photonics’ former security holders are collectively referred to as the “Share
Conversion.”
The
Merger Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing
conditions.
5
As
a condition to the Merger, we entered into an indemnity agreement with our former officer and directors (the “Pre-Merger Indemnity
Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify such former officer and directors for actions taken by them in their official
capacities relating to the consideration, approval and consummation of the Merger and certain related transactions.
The
Merger was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes. Biond Photonics is considered the
acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the Merger will be replaced with the historical financial
statements of Biond Photonics before the Merger in future filings with the SEC. The Merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Change
of Fiscal Year
On
June 30, 2021, we changed our fiscal year from the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 to the period
beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 of each year.
Note
2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Article 8 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management
such interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The accompanying financial information should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 28, 2022. The results of operations for the
period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year.
The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements.
Such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity.
Going
Concern
The
Company incurred a net loss of $ 3,451,699
and $ 2,610,590
for the year ended June 30, 2022 and the six months ended December 31, 2022,
respectively. In addition, the Company is in the research and development stage and has not generated revenue to date. In order to support
its operations, the Company will require additional infusions of cash from the sale of equity instruments or the issuance of debt instruments,
or the commencement of profitable revenue generating activities. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable
terms, the Company’s ability to fund its operations, develop or enhance its sensors in the future or respond to competitive pressures
would be significantly limited. Such limitations could require the Company to curtail, suspend or discontinue parts of its business plan.
These
conditions may raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
6
Basic
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The number of shares prior to the merger have been restated to consider the conversion into
the shares of the legal acquirer.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that
it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will
be affected.
Reclassification
of Prior Year Presentation
Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
As
defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic No. 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
(“ASC 820”), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses the market or income approach.
Based on this approach, the Company utilizes certain assumptions about the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market-corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the
valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value
hierarchy ranks the quality and the reliability of the information used to determine fair values. As a basis for considering these assumptions,
ASC 820 defines a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value.
Level
1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active, accessible market for identical assets or liabilities
Level
2 – Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace
Level
3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity
The
fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value.
The
carrying values of the Company’s cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the relatively
short maturity of these items.
Concentration
of Risk
The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced
any losses in such accounts.
Property
and Equipment
Property,
equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Equipment is depreciated over
five years , and
leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lease term. Repairs and maintenance to these assets are charged to expense as
incurred; major improvements enhancing the function and/or the asset’s useful life are capitalized. When items are sold or retired,
the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses arising from such transactions are
recognized.
7
Intangible
Assets
Intangible
assets are associated with the Aeluma.com domain name and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
five years .
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers cash in banks, deposits in transit, and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s accounts are insured by the FDIC but at times may exceed federally
insured limits.
Income
Taxes
The
Company is expected to have net operating loss carryforwards that it can use to offset a certain amount of taxable income in the future.
The Company is currently analyzing the amount of loss carryforwards that will be available to reduce future taxable income. The resulting
deferred tax assets will be offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of its realization. The primary difference between
income tax expense attributable to continuing operations and the amount of income tax expense that would result from applying domestic
federal statutory rates to income before income taxes relates to the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets.
The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 740-10, “ Income Taxes”
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not as a measurement
process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In making
this assessment, a Company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taxing authorities. The
Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Interest and
penalties totaled $ 0
for periods presented. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to IRS examination until
they are fully utilized, and such tax years are closed.
The
Company will file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of California. The Company’s federal and state return
form are subject to review by the taxing authorities. The Company is not currently under examination by any taxing authority, nor has
it been notified of an impending examination.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, which requires the measurement
and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants, and directors based on estimated
fair values.
The
Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of
the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s
statements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes model. This
model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and value of its common stock and the expected term of the stock options,
all of which are highly complex and subjective variables. For employees and directors, the expected life was calculated based on the
simplified method as described by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment. For other service providers, the expected
life was calculated using the contractual term of the award. The Company’s estimate of expected volatility was based on the volatility
of peers. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity
equivalent to the expected term of the options. We account for forfeitures upon occurrence.

5 – Facility Operating Lease
On
April 1, 2021, the Company commenced a 5-year operating lease for a facility in Santa Barbara, California with total lease payments of
$781,813.  The Company determined the lease constitutes a Right of Use (ROU) asset and has recorded the present value of the lease
payments as an asset and liability per ASC 842. The value of the asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the 60-month period
and amortization began at the start of the lease. Additionally, the lease agreement waived the first three months of rent with payments
commencing July 2021. At the commencement of the lease, the net present value of the lease payments was
767,553
In addition to these
lease payments, the Company is also responsible for its shares of common area operating expenses and electricity. Such expenses are considered
variable costs and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. The lease agreement also provides for the option to extend
the lease for two additional sixty-month periods. The lease payments for these additional periods are not included in the lease liability
amount presented on the balance sheet.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION
The
following information should be read in conjunction with Aeluma, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our”,
or the “Company”) unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Information in
this Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q that does not consist of historical facts, are “forward-looking statements.” Statements accompanied
or qualified by, or containing words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,”
“intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,”
“outlook,” “forecast,” “anticipates,” “presume,” and “assume” constitute
forward-looking statements, and as such, are not a guarantee of future performance.
Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated as a result of the factors described in the “Risk Factors” and detailed in our other Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) filings. Risks and uncertainties can include, among others, international, national and local general
economic and market conditions: demographic changes; the ability of the Company to sustain, manage or forecast its growth; the ability
of the Company to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction;
existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition;
the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy
or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to obtain sufficient financing
to continue and expand business operations; the ability to develop technology and products; changes in technology and the development
of technology and intellectual property by competitors; the ability to protect technology and develop intellectual property; and other
factors referenced in this and previous filings. Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements
as predictive of future results.
Because
of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report or incorporated by reference
might not transpire. You should review the disclosure under the heading “Risk Factors” in other filings we make with the
SEC for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied
by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
The
Company disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this report.
Overview
On
June 22, 2021, the Company, Acquisition Sub and Biond Photonics entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
(the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on June 22, 2021 (the “Closing Date”),
Biond Photonics merged with and into Acquisition Sub, with Acquisition Sub continuing as the surviving corporation and our wholly-owned
subsidiary.
As
a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of Biond Photonics, a California corporation, doing business as Aeluma. At the time
the certificates of merger reflecting the Merger were filed with the Secretaries of State of California and Delaware (the “Effective
Time”), each of Biond Photonics’ shares of capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger
was converted into the right to receive (a) 1.299135853 shares of our common stock (the “Common Share Conversion Ratio”)
, with the maximum number of shares of our common stock issuable to the former holders of Biond Photonics’ capital stock equal
to 4,100,002 after adjustments due to rounding for fractional shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, an aggregate of 2,500,000
shares of our common stock owned by our stockholders prior to the Merger were forfeited and cancelled (the “Stock Forfeiture”).
The
issuance of shares of our common stock to Biond Photonics’ former security holders are collectively referred to as the “Share
Conversion.”
14
The
Merger Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing
conditions.
As
a condition to the Merger, we entered into an indemnity agreement with our former officer and directors (the “Pre-Merger Indemnity
Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify such former officer and directors for actions taken by them in their official
capacities relating to the consideration, approval and consummation of the Merger and certain related transactions.
The
Merger was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for us for financial reporting purposes. Biond Photonics is considered
the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the Merger were replaced with the historical financial
statements of Biond Photonics before the Merger in future filings with the SEC. The Merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The
issuance of securities pursuant to the Share Conversion was not registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from
registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public
offering, and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. These securities may not be offered or sold in the U.S.
absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement and are subject to further contractual restrictions
on transfer.
Prior
to the Merger, the sole business purpose of the Company was to seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing company.
As
a result of the consummation of the Merger, on June 22, 2021, Biond Photonics, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the business
of Biond Photonics, Inc. became the business of the Company going forward. Accordingly, at the closing, the Company ceased to be a shell
company.
We
develop novel optoelectronic devices for sensing and communications applications. Aeluma has pioneered a technique to manufacture devices
using high performance compound semiconductor materials on large diameter silicon wafers that are commonly used to manufacture mass market
microelectronics. This enables cost effective manufacturing of high performance photodetector array circuits for imaging applications
in mobile devices. These devices may be used as image sensors that generate an image by detecting light, in a manner similar to a digital
camera taking a picture. Our devices may incorporate additional functionality and enhanced performance to enable 3D image capture when
integrated into various system architectures. This technology has the potential to greatly enhance the performance and capability of
camera image sensors, LiDAR, augmented reality, facial recognition, and other applications. Aeluma has acquired a key piece of manufacturing
equipment and has headquarters in Goleta, CA with a manufacturing cleanroom to house this equipment.
Private
Placement Offerings
2021
Offering
Immediately
following the Merger, we sold 3,482,500 shares of our common stock pursuant to an initial closing of a private placement offering at
a purchase price of $2.00 per share (the “Offering Price”). We held a second closing on June 28, 2021 for an additional
402,500 shares of our common stock and a third and final close on July 1, 2021 for an additional 115,000. Accordingly, we sold a
total of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. The private placement offering is referred to herein as the “Offering.”
The
aggregate gross proceeds from the three closings of the Offering were $8,000,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses
of the Offering of $1,082,575).
The
three closings of the Offering were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The common stock in the Offering was sold to “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation
D, and was conducted on a “reasonable best efforts” basis.
15
In
connection with the Offering and subject to the closing of the Offering, we agreed to pay the placement agent, GP Nurmenkari Inc. (the
“Placement Agent”), a U.S. registered broker-dealer, a cash placement fee of 10% of the gross proceeds raised from investors
in the Offering (other than the first $630,000 of common stock sold to pre-Merger Biond Photonics shareholders and their friends and
family, for which the Placement Agent received a 3% cash fee, and $170,000 of common stock sold to pre-Merger Biond Photonics friends
and family for which the Placement Agent received no cash fee) and to issue to it 50,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase
a number of shares of our common stock equal to 10% of the number of shares of common stock sold in the Offering (other than the first
$800,000 of common stock sold to pre-Merger Biond Photonics shareholders and their friends and family), with a term of five years and
an exercise price of $2.00 per share (the “Placement Agent Warrants”). We also agreed to pay certain expenses of the Placement
Agent in connection with the Offering.
As
a result of the foregoing, we paid the Placement Agent an aggregate commission of $748,900 and issued to it 50,000 shares of our common
stock and Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 360,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the two closings of the Offering.
We have also reimbursed the Placement Agent for approximately $265,000 of legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the Offering.
A
note payable to an officer of Parc Investments, Inc. in the amount of $50,000 was repaid directly from the proceeds from the Offering.
Subject
to certain customary exceptions, we agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent to the fullest extent permitted by law against certain liabilities
that may be incurred in connection with the Offering, including certain civil liabilities under the Securities Act, and, where such indemnification
is not available, to contribute to the payments the Placement Agent and their sub-agents may be required to make in respect of such liabilities.
2022
Offering
On
December 22, 2022, we entered into subscription agreements (the “2022 Subscription Agreement”) with 21 accredited investors
(“Investors”), pursuant to which the Investors purchased an aggregate of 517,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001
per share at a per share purchase price of $3.00, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,551,000 before deducting placement agent fees and
expenses of the Offering of $124,385 (the “2022 Offering”). We held a second closing of the 2022 Offering on January 10,
2023, pursuant to which we issued 214,667 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $644,000.
In
connection with the 2022 Subscription Agreement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Investors, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to register all of the shares of common stock issued in the 2022 Offering, including the shares of common
stock underlying the warrant issued to the placement agent.
Pursuant
to the 2022 Offering, the Company paid a cash placement agent fee of $134,600 and issued placement agent warrants (“2022 Placement
Agent Warrants”) to purchase up to 34,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. We also agreed to pay
certain expenses of the placement agent in connection with the 2022 Offering.
Plan
of Operations
We
have been developing our materials and characterization capabilities at our headquarters in Goleta, CA, in connection with the further
development of our business and the implementation of our plan of operations. We have installed some key manufacturing equipment at our
headquarters and will continue to develop relationships with manufacturing partners to carry out certain steps of our manufacturing processes
externally. We have gained access to a rapid prototyping facility and are leveraging this access to fabricate early-stage prototypes.
In the future, we intend to implement appropriate quality and manufacturing controls. Some equipment was procured previously, and other
equipment is being procured through purchase orders with equipment vendors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely disrupted, and may further
disrupt, the operations at certain of our suppliers and other third-party providers. Lead times for certain materials and parts ordered
have been longer than anticipated and on-site support for equipment maintenance has been challenging to schedule. Spare parts have been
procured to minimize disruption to our development. The rapid prototyping facility that we access for development was closed for a brief
period of time at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been open for unlimited access since Aeluma has first gained access.
The
primary sources of funding for equipment procurement and installation are the seed funding raised prior to becoming a public company
and the funding raised from our financing during June/July of 2021. We have also leveraged funds to continue strengthening our intellectual
property including patent applications, trademarks, and development of trade secrets and manufacturing process recipes. We will continue
to develop our manufacturing and product development strategy by further engaging customers and strategic partners.

Limited
Operating History
We
cannot guarantee that the proceeds from the Offering will be sufficient to carry out all of our business plans. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process
and possible rejection of our products in development.
If
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to carry out all of our operations. Equity financing will result in
dilution to existing stockholders.
Change
of Fiscal Year
On
June 30, 2021, we changed our fiscal year from the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 to the period
beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 of each year.

Net
revenue : We are pre-revenue and, accordingly recorded no revenues for either the six months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Operating
expenses : During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred $2,721,581 and $1,399,590, respectively, of operating
expenses. This increase was due to the start-up of operations and stock compensation expenses related to advisor and consulting agreements.
Sub-lease
rental income and other income:
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded net rental and other
income of $110,991 and $173,245, respectively. The decrease was due to the reduced rental space to a sub-lease to our tenant.
Income
tax expense : The Company did not record income tax expense for either of the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as such
amounts are insignificant.
Net
Loss : Net loss increased to $2,610,590 for the six months ended December 31,2022, as compared to $1,226,345 for the same period of
2021 for start-up of operations and stock compensation expenses related to advisor and consulting agreements.

Capital
Resources and Liquidity
Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of $2,610,590 for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit was $6,293,074. We have
been funding our operations through private loans and the sale of common stock in private placement transactions.
Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive
operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital
and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At December 31, 2022, we had $3,062,316 of cash on hand. These
funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and, as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through
the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will
be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in the case of equity financing.
Management
has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and
beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; and (c)
executing material sales or research contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and
it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that any additional financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this
Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above.
In
the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors
by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not
considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.
We
had net working capital of $3,334,489 and $4,058,409 at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Current assets decreased $667,688
to $3,741,004 at December 31, 2022 from $4,430,848 at June 30, 2022, primarily due to funding operating expenses of $574,580 for the
six months ended December 31, 2022. Current liabilities increased $60,232 to $432,671 at December 31, 2022 from $372,439 at June 30,
2022, due primarily to a $57,283 increase in spending activities in accounts payable.

The increase of $1,106,011 was due mainly to a $1,321,991 increase in net loss.
Net
cash used in our investing activities was $103,826 and $570,248 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investing
activity for the six months ended December 31, 2021was related to the setup of our new facility.
Our
financing activities generated a cash inflow of $1,426,615 and $161,930 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
due to the offering described above.

Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the
reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates
and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently
uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
A
summary of our other critical accounting policies is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. During the six months ended
December 31,2022, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies.

4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
of the end of the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon those evaluations, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of December 31, 2022 to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Going
forward from this filing, the Company intends to work on maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to be effective in
providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls
is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the quarter covered by this Report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

From
time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that it considers to be a part of the ordinary
course of its business. To the best of our knowledge, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings that could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations; however, the
Company may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.
