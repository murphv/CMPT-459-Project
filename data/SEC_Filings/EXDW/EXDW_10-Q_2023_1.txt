NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS
OF December 31, 2022
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Exceed World, Inc. (the “Company”), was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014.
On September 26, 2018, e-Learning Laboratory Co.,
Ltd. (“e-Learning”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Force International Holdings Limited, which was incorporated in Hong
Kong with limited liability (“Force Holdings”), entered into a share purchase agreement with Force Internationale Limited
(“Force Internationale”), the holding company of Force Holdings, in which e-Learning agreed to sell and Force Internationale
agreed to purchase 74.5% equity interest of the Company at a consideration of $26,000.
On September 26, 2018, the same date, Force Internationale
entered into a share purchase agreement with the Company, in which Force Internationale agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase
100% equity interest of Force Holdings. In consideration of the agreement, the Company issued 12,700,000 common stock at US$1 each to
Force Internationale. The results of these transactions are that Force Internationale is an 84.4% owner of the Company and the Company
is a 100% owner of Force Holdings.
On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a share
contribution agreement with Force Internationale. Under this agreement, the Company transferred 100% of the equity interest of School
TV Co., Ltd. ("School TV"), to Force Internationale without consideration. This agreement was approved by the board of directors
of the Company, Force Internationale and School TV. Upon the completion of the disposal, School TV was deconsolidated from the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company operates through
our wholly owned subsidiaries, which are engaged in provision of the educational services through an internet platform called “Force
Club”.
The Company has elected September 30th as its fiscal
year end.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Results
for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When
used in these notes, the terms "Company", "we", "us" or "our" mean the Company. Certain information
and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America has been omitted from these statements pursuant to such accounting principles and, accordingly, they do not
include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, included in our Form 10-K.
NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact
on net earnings and financial position.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The presentation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses reported in those financial statements. Certain significant
accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to write-down in value of inventory,
useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets and legal contingencies. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly
impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. Due to the high uncertainty
of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related
financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. Operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from management's
estimates and assumptions.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
A related party is generally defined as (i) any person
that holds 10% or more of the Company’s securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Company’s management, (iii) someone
that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly
influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there
is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.
Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed
to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist. Representations
about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company maintains its books and records in its
local currencies, Japanese YEN (“JPY”), Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”) and the United States Dollars (“US$”),
which are the functional currencies as being the primary currencies of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange
differences are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
The reporting currency of the Company is US$ and the
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$. In accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,  Translation of
Financial Statement , assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, using the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. Shareholders’
equity is translated at historical exchange rate at the time of transaction. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial
statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of changes
in shareholders’ equity.
Translation of amounts from the local currency
of
the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates:
December 31, 2022
December 31, 2021
Current JPY: US$1 exchange rate
132.70
115.02
Average JPY: US$1 exchange rate

113.71
Current HK$: US$1 exchange rate

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company operates and manages multilevel marketing
(“MLM”) in operating its businesses as the Force Club Membership and generates revenues primarily by providing the rights
to access the Company’s educational content and to recruit new members.
The Company
recognizes revenue by applying the following steps in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from contracts with Customers.
The Company
recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services.
- Identification of the contract, or contracts, with
a customer
- Identification of the performance obligations in
the contract
- Determination of the transaction price
- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
- Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the
performance obligation
Force Club Membership fee
Nature of operation
Our revenue generated from Force Club Membership arrangements
accounted for substantially all of our revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Generally, the Company grants Force Club members
the rights to access the Company’s educational content. There are three tiers of members, namely standard members, support
members and premium members.
The premium members are granted full access to the
Company’s educational content and the right to recruit prospect customers to become the Company’s members. Each premium member
needs to purchase a premium pack, containing promotional materials aiding the recruiting process, from the Company. The standard members
are granted limited access to the Company’s educational content.
To further promote the Company’s business, starting
fiscal year 2021, the Company also offers its customers to subscribe and become a support member. Similar to a premium member, the support
members are granted full access to the Company’s educational content and the right to recruit prospect customers to become the Company’s
members, but the amount of commission entitled to the support member for each recruitment is lower than that to the premium members. The
customers subscribing to support membership pay a lower fee for the access to educational content and will receive promotional materials
which is substantially lesser in scale as compared to that to a premium member. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the revenue generated from support member subscription is still immaterial.
The support member has the choice to become a premium
member by making relevant premium member registration and purchasing the upgrade pack from the Company. The revenue from upgrade pack
is accounted for in the same manner as the revenue from the premium pack as described below.
Revenue from the premium pack (including the upgrade
pack) is recognized net of
discounts and return allowances at a point in time upon delivery.
Revenue from the right to access the Company’s educational content is recognized over a period of time ratably over the effective
period. For sales of premium packs and upgrade packs with return conditions, the Company
reasonably estimate the possibility of return based on historical experience. There were no liabilities for return allowances nor assets
from the right to recover products from the associated return allowances recorded as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as substantially all sales of premium packs (including the upgrade pack) during the periods then ended have
reached the end of the return periods.
The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews
results analyzed by customers and the analysis is only presented at the revenue level with no allocation of direct or indirect costs.
The Company determines that it has only one operating segment. Consequently, the Company does not disaggregate revenue recognized from
contracts with customers. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue was generated in Japan.
Contract asset and liability
Deferred income is recorded when consideration is
received from a member prior to the goods were delivered or the access was granted. As of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, the Company's
deferred income was
$ 2,034,940
and
$ 866,916
respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized
$ 866,916
of deferred income in the opening balance.
The Company does not have any contract asset.
OPERATING
LEASES
The Company recognizes its leases in accordance with
ASC 842 - Leases. Under ASC 842, lessees are required to recognize all qualified operating leases at the commencement date including a
lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and
a right-of-use (ROU) asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset
for the lease term. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate, on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it
is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease
liability plus any initial direct costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives.
The Company elected the practical expedient not to
separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of underlying assets and the short-term lease exemption for contracts with
lease terms of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes lease expenses for such leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In addition, the Company elected the land easement transition practical expedient and did not reassess whether an existing or expired
land easement is a lease or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a lease.

NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures , ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies into three levels:
Level 1:   Quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   Significant other inputs that are
directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3:   Significant unobservable inputs which
are supported by little or no market activity.
The Company considers the carrying amount of its financial
assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, accounts payable,
income tax payable, contingency liabilities, deferred income, accrued expenses and other payables, other current liabilities and current
portion of operating and finance lease obligations approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31,
2022 and September 30, 2022 owing to their short-term or present value nature or present value of the assets and liabilities.

NOTE
9 - CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to various claims and legal
proceedings in the course of conducting the business related to Force Club Membership and, from time to time, the Company may become involved
in additional claims and lawsuits incidental to the businesses. The Company’s legal counsel and management routinely assess the
likelihood of adverse judgments and outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses; to the extent losses are reasonably
estimable. Accruals are recorded for these matters to the extent that management concludes a loss is probable and the financial impact,
should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonable estimable.
In the opinion of management, appropriate and adequate
accruals for legal matters have been made, and management believes that the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued
is remote. Nevertheless, the Company cannot predict the impact of future developments affecting our pending or future claims and lawsuits.
The Company expenses legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are adjusted as required as better information becomes
available to the Company. The factors the Company considers when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the
opinions and views of the Company’s legal counsel; (ii) the Company’s previous experience; and (iii) the decision of our management
as to how we intend to respond to the complaints.
As of filing date, the Company had nine pending legal
cases, claiming a damage of approximately JPY165.6 million (approximately $1.2 million) related to the cancellation of contracts. The
Company’s legal counsel estimated a probable settlement for these cases with total settlement amount of approximately JPY66.3 million
(approximately $ 500,000 ). The Company accrued a total liability of JPY66.3 million (approximately $500,000) as of December 31, 2022.

Company Overview
Corporate History
The Company was originally incorporated with the name
Brilliant Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with,
an operating business. On January 12, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of
the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“e-Learning”).
Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to e-Learning, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represents all of our issued
and outstanding shares. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, e-Learning gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder of the Company.
On January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name
to Exceed World, Inc. and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment. On January 12, 2016, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio
resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. Also, on January 12,
2016, Mr. Tomoo Yoshida was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
Pursuant to this Agreement, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E&F Co., Ltd., a Japan
corporation (“E&F”), which represents all of its issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $4,835 (JPY 500,000).
Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the
issued and outstanding shares of E&F’s common stock and E&F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World. On August
4, 2016, the E&F changed its name to School TV Co., Ltd (“School TV”) and filed with the Legal Affairs Bureau in Osaka,
Japan.
On April 1, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase
agreements with 7 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 140,000 shares of common stock in total to these
individuals and received $270 as aggregate consideration. Each paid JPY0.215 per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share
by each was the equivalent of about $0.002. This sale of shares was exempt from registration in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") because the above sales of the stock were made to non-U.S. persons as defined under
Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S, pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United
States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.
On August 1, 2016, the Company changed its fiscal
year end from November 30 to September 30.
On August 9, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase
agreements with 33 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 3,300 shares of common stock in total to these
individuals and received $330 as aggregate consideration. Each paid JPY10 per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share
by each shareholder was the equivalent to about $0.1. These shares were sold pursuant to the Company’s effective S-1 Registration
Statement deemed effective on July 20, 2016 at 4pm EST.
On October 28, 2016, the Company, with the approval
of its board of directors and its majority shareholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting, authorized the cancellation of shares
owned by e-Learning. e-Learning consented to the cancellation of shares. The total number of shares cancelled was 19,000,000 shares which
was comprised of 16,500,000 restricted common shares and 2,500,000 free trading shares.
On October 28, 2016, every one (1) share of common
stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding was automatically reclassified and changed into twenty (20) shares
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company, par value $.0001 per share. (“20-for-1 Forward Stock Split”)
No fractional shares were issued. The authorized number of shares, and par value per share, of common stock are not affected by the 20-for-1
Forward Stock Split.
During July 2017 and August 2017, e-Learning entered
into stock purchase agreements with 24 Japanese individuals. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 2,240,000 shares of its common
stock in total to these individuals and received $38,263 as aggregate consideration.
On September 26, 2018, Force Internationale Limited,
a Cayman Island limited company (“Force Internationale”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
e-Learning and 74.5% owner of the Company. Under this Share Purchase Agreement, e-Learning transferred its 74.5% interest in the Company
to Force Internationale. As consideration for this transfer, Force Internationale paid $26,000.00 to e-Learning. Immediately subsequent,
the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Force Internationale, to acquire 100% of Force Holdings and 100% direct owner
of e-Learning. In consideration of this agreement, the Company issued 12,700,000 common shares to Force Internationale. The result of
these transaction is that Force Internationale is a 84.4% owner of the Company, the Company is a 100% owner of Force Holdings, and Force
Holdings is a 100% owner of e-Learning. Prior to the Share Purchase Agreements, Force Internationale was an indirect owner of 74.5% of
the Company and subsequent to the Share Purchase Agreements, Force Internationale is a direct owner of 84.4% of the Company. The Share
Purchase Agreements were approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, Force Internationale, Force Holdings, and e-Learning.
On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a share
contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Force Internationale. Under this Agreement, the Company transferred
100% of the equity interest of School TV Co., Ltd. ("School TV"), to Force Internationale without consideration. This Contribution
Agreement was approved by the board of directors of the Company, Force Internationale and School TV. Upon the completion of the disposal,
School TV was deconsolidated from the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Business Information
As of December 31, 2022, we operate through our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, which are engaged in the provision of the educational services through an internet platform called “Force Club”.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1-1-36, 1-23-38-6F, Esakacho,
Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063, Japan. Our phone number is +81-6-6339-4177.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, we
had cash in the amount of $23,879,873 and $23,822,217, respectively. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations
without the need for additional funding.
Revenues
We recorded revenue of $6,031,803 for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 as opposed to $5,042,587 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue, in our opinion,
is attributed to increase in recruitment activities of premium Force Club members.
Net Income
We recorded net income of $92,459 for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 as opposed to net loss of $669,726 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net income is
attributed to increase in revenues.
Cash flow
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had
negative cash flows from operations in the amount of $2,980,749 as opposed to $3,117,932 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in operating cash flow, in our opinion, is mainly attributed to the increase in net income and deferred income.
Working capital
As of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, we
had working capital of $18,000,630 and $15,273,484 respectively.
Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included
in selling and distributions expenses. Advertising expenses were $383,577 and $343,570 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.
Advertising expenses were comprised of, but not limited
to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards, and public relations
activities.
Future Plans
The Company had a good start in the fiscal year of
2023. Sales for the period under review increased compared to the same period of the previous year and we expect further growth in the
following periods. Over the course of the next twelve months, the Company will continue to focus on expanding its sales network in order
to strengthen its business activities as well as to provide benefits and incentives to premium members as value-added services, in addition
to the standard compensation package.
Impact of COVID-19
It is expected
that Japan's economy will recover and the Company will be able to continue conducting its business activities without restrictions. However,
due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, the Company has limited visibility on the full impact brought upon by the COVID-19
pandemic, and the related financial impact to future periods cannot be estimated at this time.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2022,
the end of the fiscal period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer,
with the participation of our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures. The officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered
by this report due to material weaknesses identified below.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination
of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors,
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report
related party transactions and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer who
also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the above annual evaluation.
Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into
the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that have occurred for the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
