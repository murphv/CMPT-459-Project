6 Table of Contents   KNOW LABS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by Know Labs, Inc, (“the Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the fiscal periods presented have been included.   These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 20, 2022. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year, or for any other fiscal period.    1. ORGANIZATION   Know Labs, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. The Company currently has authorized
205,000,000
shares of capital stock, of which
200,000,000
are shares of voting common stock, par value $ 0.001
per share, and
5,000,000
are shares preferred stock, par value $ 0.001
per share. At the annual shareholder meeting held on October 15, 2021, the Company’s authorized shares of common stock was increased to
200,000,000
shares of voting common stock, par value $ 0.001
per share.
The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. The Company call these its “Bio-RFID” technology platform when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy and “ChromaID” technology platform when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with biosensor technology is analyzed with trade secret algorithms. There are a significant number of analytes in the human body that relate to health and wellness. The Company’s focus is upon those analytes relating to human health, the identification of which provide diagnostic information and require, by their nature, clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration.   On April 30, 2020, the Company incorporated Particle, Inc. (“Particle”) in the State of Nevada. Particle is focused on the development and commercialization of the Company’s extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains the parent company’s singular focus. Since incorporation, Particle has engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. It is seeking partners to take the product to market.   On September 17, 2021, the Company incorporated AI Mind, Inc. (“AI Mind”) in the State of Nevada. AI Mind was focused on monetizing the AI deep learning platform. Since incorporation, it initially focused on creating graphical images which were sold as Non Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”). The Company does not expect future activity or revenue from that source. During the year ended September 30, 2022,   the   Company’s AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $ 4,360,087
of which substantially all were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2021.   2.   LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
The Company has cash and cash equivalents of $ 9,680,272
and net working capital of $ 8,277,336
(exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of December 31, 2022. The Company anticipates that it will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has enough available cash to operate until at least February 15, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s accumulated deficit was $ 105,220,597 . The Company has had limited capital resources and intends to seek additional cash via equity and debt offerings.
On September 20, 2022, the Company completed a public offering of the Company’s common stock pursuant to which the Company sold
4,140,000
shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $ 2.00
per share, for total gross proceeds of $ 8,280,000 . After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $ 7,424,679 .   The proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, which could be exercised on a cash basis, may generate potential proceeds of up to $ 15,681,788 . The Company expects that portions of these warrants will be exercised.   3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS     Basis of Presentation
–The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements was prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).     7 Table of Contents   Principles of Consolidation
– The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Particle and AI Mind. Intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.     Cash and Cash Equivalents
– The Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $ 250,000 . The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk for cash on deposit.
Equipment
– Equipment consists of machinery, leasehold improvements and  furniture and fixtures, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset, generally
2 - 5
years, except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over
5
years.
Long-Lived Assets
– The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying values exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.
Revenue Recognition
– The Company determines revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:     · identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;         · identification of the performance obligations in the contract;         · determination of the transaction price;         · allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and         · recognition of the revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s artificial AI deep learning platform generated revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs. The Company engineering team, using its research data, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The NFTs produced had no recorded cost basis. The Company does not expect future activity or revenue from that source.   Research and Development Expenses
– Research and development expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.   The Company’s current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving its Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity and developing new and unique applications for this technology. The Company believes that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to its future success. The Company incurred expenses of
1,743,051
and $ 885,752
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.   Advertising
– Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 51,084
and $ 294,391 , respectively.
Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments
–   ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:   Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;   Level 2 – Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and   Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.    The recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.
8 Table of Contents   The Company has a money market account which is considered a Level 1 asset. The balance as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was $ 9,024,335
and $ 11,821,931 , respectively.   Derivative Financial Instruments
–
Pursuant to ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”, the Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company then determines if embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.     The Company determined that the conversion features for purposes of bifurcation within its currently outstanding convertible notes payable were immaterial and there was no derivative liability to be recorded as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.   Stock Based Compensation
– The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by the Company at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. The Company recognizes stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.
Convertible Securities
– Based upon ASC 815-15, the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities. The Company will evaluate its contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. In the event partial reclassification of contracts subject to ASC 815-40-25 is necessary, due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient shares authorized and unissued, shares will be allocated on the basis of issuance date, with the earliest issuance date receiving first allocation of shares. If a reclassification of an instrument were required, it would result in the instrument issued latest being reclassified first.   Net Loss per Share
– Under the provisions of ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
48,207,937
shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were options outstanding for the purchase of
24,480,495
common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling
9,704,620
shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of
21,736,313
common shares, and
8,108,356  shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has
9,020,264
common shares at the current price of $ 0.25
per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $ 2,255,066 . All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the December 31, 2022, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.
As of December 31, 2021, there were options outstanding for the purchase of
18,423,245
common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling
11,775,745
shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of
21,654,013
common shares, and
8,108,356  shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has
16,124,764
common shares ( 9,020,264
common shares at the current price of $ 0.25
per share and
7,104,500
common shares at the current price of $ 2 .00 per share) reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $ 16,464,066 . All of which could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the December 31, 2021, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.   Comprehensive loss
– Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. There were no differences between net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and comprehensive loss for those periods.   Dividend Policy
– The Company has never paid any cash dividends and intends, for the foreseeable future, to retain any future earnings for the development of its business. The Company’s future dividend policy will be determined by the board of directors on the basis of various factors, including results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities.   Use of Estimates
– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     9 Table of Contents   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Based on the Company’s review of accounting standard updates recently issued, those standards not yet required to be adopted and proposed standards for the future, the Company does believe such items are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Deep Learning Platform   AI Revenue   During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company’s AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $ 4,360,087 . The Company’s sales of NFTs are generated using the NFT digital exchange, OpenSea. Customers purchasing the NFT’s must make payments in the crypto currency, Ethereum. The Ethereum is received into a digital wallet and then moved to an account at Coinbase where the Ethereum is converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company was not able to establish a digital wallet and corporate account at Coinbase in order to receive the Ethereum. The Company used the digital wallet and Coinbase account of the Company’s CEO. The Company and the CEO executed an assignment of his account to the Company while the Company establishes its own Coinbase account. All proceeds received from the sale of NFT were deposited in the CEO’s personal digital accounts.
After the sale of the NFT, the Ethereum was converted to US dollars as soon as practically possible. The Company recorded the total value of the gross NFT sale in revenue. Costs incurred in connection with the NFT transaction were recorded in the statement of operations as selling and transactional cost of digital assets and include costs to outside consultants, estimated employee and CEO special bonus compensation, digital asset conversion losses and estimated sales and use tax. The amount totaled $ 3,430,438
for the year ended September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, accrued expenses include $ 343,878
of expenses, primarily sales and use tax and other expenses.   5.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

and $ 41,672
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All equipment is used primarily for research and development purposes and accordingly $ 98,002
in depreciation is classified in research and development expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022.   6.   LEASES   The Company has entered into operating leases for office and development facilities which range from two to three years and include options to renew. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based upon the unique facts and circumstances at the inception of the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use asses are recorded based upon the present value of the lease payments over the expected lease term. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, total operating lease liabilities for remaining long term leases was approximately $ 257,000
and $ 302,000 , respectively. Right of use assets totaled approximately $ 244,000
and $ 288,000
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.   In the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 81,599
and $ 40,629 , respectively in total lease costs for the leases. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.
The weighted average remaining lease term for the operating leases was
15
months at December 31, 2022 and the weighted average discount rate was
7 %.
The minimum future lease payments as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report.   BUSINESS   Overview   We are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary sensor technologies which, when paired with our machine learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. We call this our “Bio-RFID” technology platform, when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy, and our “ChromaID” technology platform, when pertaining to optical spectroscopy.
ChromaID was the first technology developed and patented by our company. For the past several years, we have focused on extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property, such as the Bio-RFID technology platform. Due to the significant advances made with the Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory, the company shifted its resources to focus on Bio-RFID and the commercialization and development of related patent assets.
The first application of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product marketed as a glucose monitoring device. It will provide the user with real-time information on their blood glucose levels. We have previously announced two versions of our non-invasive glucose monitoring device and identified these as the KnowU and the UBand. The KnowU will be a portable monitoring device for intermittent or spot glucose monitoring, and the UBand will be a wearable for continuous glucose monitoring. These products will require US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance before entering the market.   Corporate History and Structure   Know Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, our company has been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary spectroscopic technologies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum.
Know Labs has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Particle, Inc. incorporated on April 30, 2020 and AI Mind, Inc. incorporated on September 17, 2021.  At this time there is no activity being undertaken in either subsidiary while the Company gives all of its attention to its core focus of its Bio-RFID technology.
The Know Labs Technology   We have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely identify and measure almost any organic and inorganic material or analyte. Our patented technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light and infrared to radio and microwave wavelengths to perform analytics which allow the user to accurately identify and measure materials and analytes depending upon the specified targets or endpoints and field of use. Our proprietary platform technologies are called Bio-RFID and ChromaID.   ChromaID was the first technology developed and patented by our company. Working in our lab, we have developed extensions and new inventions derived partly from the ChromaID technology, which we refer to as Bio-RFID. Bio-RFID utilizes spectroscopy at higher wavelengths than ChromaID’s optical range to span radio wave and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. We believe an important competitive differentiator for Bio-RFID to be its ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real-time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring. We are advancing the development of this technology by increasing its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We have announced detailed results confirming that we have successfully been able to non-invasively measure blood glucose levels in humans. Significantly, we believe Bio-RFID successfully addresses the limiting qualities of optical technologies whose diagnostic capacities may be inhibited by skin tones and other factors.     17 Table of Contents   Our ability to obtain exacting results from the data collected through our Bio-RFID sensor technology also referred to as radio frequency spectroscopy or RF spectroscopy is enabled by our trade secret algorithms built through our machine learning platform. We have been refining these algorithms so they can accurately determine blood glucose levels. We believe our algorithms can also provide accurate measurements for blood alcohol and blood oxygen levels, which we have identified in preliminary tests.  We expect them to provide the analytics for the long list of other analytes in the human body that we will pursue non-invasive detection of, many of which are set forth in our issued patent USPTO 11,033,208 B1.
We continue to build the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize our technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with new inventions. The first application of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product marketed as a glucose monitoring device. It will provide the user with real-time information on their blood glucose levels. We have previously announced two versions of our non-invasive glucose monitoring device.  We have identified these as the KnowU and the UBand. The KnowU will be a portable monitoring device for intermittent or spot glucose monitoring, and the UBand will be a wearable for continuous glucose monitoring. These products will require FDA clearance before entering the market.   We have also announced the results of internal laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre®) and DexCom (G6®). These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our patented technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our technology completely non-invasively monitors blood glucose levels.   We have begun the internal process to pursue FDA clearance for our non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device. To guide us in that undertaking, we previously announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer and formed a medical and regulatory advisory board to guide us through the FDA process. Additionally, we have retained third-party quality assurance and documentation consultants to ensure that the rigorous requirements of the FDA are met. We are unable, however, to estimate the time necessary for FDA approval or the likelihood of success in that endeavor.   While the first focus of our Bio-RFID platform is non-invasive glucose monitoring, it is important to note that the Bio-RFID platform has the capacity to monitor and identify other analytes in the human body. Each additional analyte we identify over time will require its own subsequent FDA clearance, the success of which we are unable to estimate at this time.   Our ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of hundreds to thousands of specific data points.
The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification, and identification applications.
Bio-RFID and ChromaID: Foundational Platform Technologies   Our technologies provide a unique platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies are “enabling” technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which we believe significant businesses can be built. While we are pursuing our core focus on commercializing our glucose monitor, we believe non-core clinical and non-clinical applications represent a multitude of opportunities for strategic collaboration, joint development and licensing agreements with leading companies in their respective industries.   As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identify and monitor changes in the quantity of blood glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other analytes or molecular structures this same technology can identify in the human body which, over time, we intend to focus on. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various disease biomarkers or pre-conditions.   Similarly, ChromaID technology can, for example, effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology could identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It could provide real-time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It could detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different liquids.     18 Table of Contents   Product Strategy
We have announced the development of our non-invasive glucose monitor and our desire to obtain FDA clearance for the marketing of this product. We are currently undertaking internal development work of these products for the commercial marketplace. We have also announced the engagement of several strategic partners focused on sensor technology, product design, data science, manufacturing and regulatory affairs, who we will work with to bring this product to market. We will make further announcements regarding this product as development, testing, manufacturing, and regulatory approval work progresses.
Our efforts are entirely focused on productizing Bio-RFID and collecting high quality data for validation purposes, including third-party studies, and appropriate and required clinical trials. At this point in our development cycle, the sensor hardware continues to be miniaturized and optimized, the product form factor is nearing completion, and the algorithms which provide accurate results from the data collected by our sensor are being refined to improve sensor accuracy.   Sales and Marketing   While we continue with our internal development efforts and the move toward FDA approved clinical trials and expected (but not guaranteed) clearance of our first product, a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device, we will explore the several potential avenues for moving our first product and potential follow-on products into the marketplace.  The avenues being explored include direct to consumer, initial launch partners, broad distribution partners, licensing partners and private label approaches to the market among others.  We have begun to build our internal commercial and marketing team in preparation for detailed strategic thinking about the optimal approach to the marketplace.
Competition   We group the competition into three large categories. Those are (i) large global technology companies who may enter the blood glucose monitoring and other medical diagnostic markets, (ii) legacy providers of blood glucose monitoring technology, and (iii) new entrants working to achieve a non-invasive solution or more acceptable blood glucose monitoring solution which may or may not be similar to our technology. With regard to companies in each category, we perform due diligence from all publicly available sources of information on their relevant technologies and their product plans. This information informs and refines our activities and underscores our sense of urgency as we work to bring our own technology to the marketplace. The addressable market is very large and there is room for a multitude of providers of blood glucose monitoring services. Of note, we believe few, if any, of the competitors in the blood glucose monitoring space possess a platform technology competitive with our Bio-RFID technology and our ability to identify a multitude of analytes in the human body.   Competitive Advantages   We believe our key competitive strengths include:     · Through first principles, Bio-RFID’s ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring.         · Our Bio-RFID technology is non-invasive, using radio waves to identify and measure what is going on inside the body in real-time         · Our Bio-RFID technology platform can be integrated into a variety of wearable, mobile or counter-top form factors, as well as interoperability with existing products from current market leaders.         · No needles nor invasive transmitters in your body, making Bio-RFID sensors convenient and pain-free.         · No expensive supplies, such as test strips and lancets, are required to operate Bio-RFID devices.   Growth Strategy
The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:     · Initially, entering the diabetes glucose monitoring market with our non-invasive glucose monitoring devices.         · Following our entry into the glucose monitoring market, entering other clinical monitoring markets for continuous, non-invasive hormone, medication metabolite, endocrinology components and biomolecular monitoring.         · Applying our Bio-RFID platform technology to lifestyle analysis, clinical trials and chronic illnesses. We believe that potential use cases include real-time wearable medication monitoring and detection of, for example, ovulation and hormone deficiency.         · Significantly, every new application will function utilizing the same sensor. We expect that hardware changes will not be required to target new analytes, so you will not need a new device, but an updated software algorithm will be required.
· Each new application provides new opportunities for monetization of the Bio-RFID platform technology. Each additional analyte we identify over time will require its own subsequent FDA approval.

Research and Development   Our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving our Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity, and developing new and unique applications for this technology and the machine learning platform that drives its analytics. As part of this effort, we conduct on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. We are also actively involved in identifying new applications. Our current internal team along with outside consultants have considerable experience working with the application of our technologies. We engage third party experts as required to supplement our internal team.  We believe that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to our future success. We incurred expenses of $1,743,000, $5,386,000 and $3,970,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.   Intellectual Property
The cornerstone of our foundational platform technology is our intellectual property portfolio. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy which includes focus on patents where appropriate and a diligent protection of trade secrets. To date, we have been granted 29 patents and 19 design patents. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis, with the filing of new patents. If we include pending patents, our IP portfolio reaches nearly 100 patents issued and pending, which positions the company as the top worldwide IP holder in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, according to ipCapital Group, a leading IP and innovation consulting firm serving clients since 1998. We possess all rights, title and interest to the issued patents.
Most recently, we announced the Company has been granted a new foundational patent that equates the company’s Bio-RFID diagnostic technology to a current reference standard for glucose monitoring, widely used by diabetes researchers, hospital labs and glucose meter manufacturers, and establishes a specific, superior benchmark range of clinical accuracy, known as the MARD or Mean Absolute Relative Difference. U.S. Patent No. 11,529,077, titled “High Performance Glucose Sensor,” was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This patent explicitly designates a MARD range of 5.0% to 9.9% for Know Lab’s non-invasive diagnostics technology platform. MARD is an industry and FDA-accepted benchmark of clinical accuracy. The range patented for Know Labs’ Bio-RFID platform is equal to or superior to the MARD readings of any FDA-cleared blood glucose monitoring products, highlighting its importance for Know Labs’ future and its already robust IP Portfolio.   Our issued patents will expire at various times between 2027 and 2041. Pending patents, if and when issued, may have expiration dates that extend further in time. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.   The issued patents cover the fundamental aspects of our ChromaID and Bio-RFID technology and a number of unique applications. We have filed patents on the fundamental aspects of our Bio-RFID technology and growing number of unique applications. We will continue, over time, to expand our patent portfolio.
Additionally, significant aspects of our technology are maintained as trade secrets which may not be disclosed through the patent filing process. We are diligent in maintaining and securing our trade secrets.   Related Patent Assets   Inherent in a platform technology is the ability to develop or license technology in diverse fields of use apart from our core focus. We focus on human health and wellness with a first focus on the non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose. We will pursue the identification of a multitude of analytes in the human body that are important to diagnostics over time. We will also identify, over time, opportunities for our intellectual property to be deployed in areas outside of human health and wellness.
We may, although we cannot guarantee that we will, create other such subsidiaries over time.  Additionally, we may license our intellectual property to third parties so that they may pursue activities that are not a part of our core focus.
Employees   As of December 31, 2022, we had 19 full-time and part employees. Our senior management and other personnel are located in our Seattle, Washington offices. We periodically utilize consulting firms and individual contractors to supplement our workforce.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview   We are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which, when paired with our artificial intelligence, or AI, deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. We call these our “Bio-RFID™” technology platform when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy; and “ChromaID” technology platform when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our biosensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI deep learning platform.     20 Table of Contents   ChromaID is the first technology developed and patented by our company. For the past several years, we have focused on extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. We call this technology platform Bio-RFID. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of our company is on our Bio-RFID technology, its commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, our company works to exploit additional opportunities and markets that our broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.   On April 30, 2020, we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, Particle, Inc. Particle was focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains our company’s singular focus. Since incorporation, Particle was engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. Particle is now looking for partners to take this product to market.   On September 17, 2021 we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, AI Mind, Inc., for the purpose of identifying and capitalizing on market opportunities for our AI deep learning platform (discussed below). The first activity undertaken by AI Mind was the creation of graphical images expressed as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, utilizing the AI deep learning platform. During the year ended September 30, 2022,
AI Mind, operating our AI deep learning platform, began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFT’s and had sales of $4,351,000.  We do not expect  any significant future revenue from the sale of NFT’s.
Recent Developments   On January 23, 2023, Phillip A. Bosua resigned from the Board of Directors and from his position as our Chief Executive Officer.   On January 23, 2023, our Board of Directors appointed Ronald P. Erickson, the current Chairman of the Board, to the position of Chief Executive Officer.   On January 27, 2023, we announced the following new officers/transitions: Masanori King Takee, Chief Technology Officer, Leo Trautwein, Chief Commercial Officer, and Jessica English, Chief Marketing Officer.   Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance   Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:
· the ability of our research and development team to produce an FDA clearance quality technology;         · our ability to recruit and maintain quality personnel with the talent to bring our technology to the market;         · the production of market ready products which can sustain FDA clearance quality results;         · the clearance by the FDA after their rigorous clinical trial process of our products for the marketplace;         · the receptivity of the marketplace and the addressable diabetes community to our new non-invasive glucose monitoring technology; and         · access to sufficient capital to support us until its products achieve FDA clearance and are accepted in the marketplace.   Segment Reporting   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280,

Our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2022 are summarized in the table below:
Less Than       Contractual Cash Obligations (1)   Total     1  Year     1-3 Years   Operating leases   $ 328,033     $ 216,664     $ 111,369   Convertible notes payable
2,255,066       2,255,066       -       $ 2,583,099     $ 2,471,730     $ 111,369     (1) Convertible notes payable includes $2,255,066 that can be converted into common stock upon demand. We expect to incur capital expenditures related to the development of the “Bio-RFID™” and “ChromaID” technologies. None of the expenditures are contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.     23 Table of Contents   ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   We had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at December 31, 2022.
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We do not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
b) Inherent Limitations on Internal controls
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.   c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, which were identified in connection with our management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting.     24 Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   We may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are currently not a party to any pending legal proceeding that is not ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business.   ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS   SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized below. These risks are discussed more fully in the “ Risk Factors ” section immediately following this summary. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:   Risks Related to Our Business and Industry     · Implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits.         · If our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, including as a result of cyber-attacks, our business operations could be disrupted and our reputation could suffer.     25 Table of Contents     · We rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our products.         · Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business.   Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

You should carefully read and consider all of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained or referred to in this report, before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of the following events occur, our financial condition, business and results of operations (including cash flows) may be materially adversely affected.  In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
The near-term effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic are known, as they adversely affected our business. Some longer term effects, such as supply chain issues and inflation, known and may, from time to time, adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow. At the same time, new variants of Covid-19 have appeared. We will remain alert to the impact of these and other infectious diseases on our employees and our business.   On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The spread of COVID-19 caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially as to travel and congregating in large numbers. Over time, the incidence of COVID-19 and its variants has diminished although periodic spikes in incidence occur. Consequently, restrictions imposed by various governmental health organizations may change over time. Several states have lifted restrictions only to reimpose such restrictions as the number of cases rise and new variants arise.
Over the past two years, the impact of COVID-19 has had adverse effects on our business by slowing down our ability to work with third parties outside of Seattle on testing and validation. We have witnessed supply chain-related delays and increasing costs due to inflation.  It is difficult to predict what other adverse effects, if any, COVID-19 and related viral strains and related matters can have on our business, or against the various aspects of same.     We may experience long-term disruptions to our operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic and the presence of new variants of COVID-19; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities critical to its business or supply chains. We are actively monitoring, and will continue to actively monitor, the pandemic and the potential impact on its operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, industry and workforce.   We are subject to general securities market uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and geo-political and economic considerations.     National securities markets in the United States and worldwide have undergone unprecedented stress in recent years due to, among other things, uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainties surrounding the military conflict in Ukraine, uncertainties regarding the economy and increasing inflation, and the resulting reactions and outcomes of governments, businesses and the general population. These uncertainties have resulted in declines in all market sectors and governmental actions to support the markets. As a result, until these matters have stabilized, the markets may not be available to us for the purpose of raising required capital. Should we not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary to execute on our plans in full, or on terms which are economically feasible, we may be unable to sustain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan and may have to reduce the planned future growth and/or scope of our operations.     26 Table of Contents   We need additional financing to support our technology development and ongoing operations, pay our debts and maintain ownership of our intellectual properties.   We are currently operating at a loss and using substantial cash to fund our operation. We believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through February 15, 2024. We may need additional financing to implement our business plan and to service our ongoing operations, pay our current debts (described below) and maintain ownership of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any needed funding, or that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to restructure our operations and/or divest all or a portion of our business. We are each seeking additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back, eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell that number of shares, if any.
We need to continue as a going concern if our business is to succeed.   As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $$9,680,000 and net working capital of approximately $8,277,000  (exclusive of convertible notes payable). We have experienced net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $105,221,000 and net losses in the amount of $3,823,000, $20,071,000 and $25,360,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We incurred non-cash expenses of $1,053,000, $12,142,000, and $17,701,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We intend to seek additional cash via equity and debt offerings.
On September 20, 2022, we completed a public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 4,140,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, for total gross proceeds of $8,280,000. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $7,424,679.   The proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, which could be exercised on a cash basis, may generate potential proceeds of up to $15,682,000. We cannot provide assurance that any of these warrants will be exercised.   As of
December 31, 2022, we owed approximately $2,552,000 and if we do not satisfy these obligations, the lenders may have the right to demand payment in full or exercise other remedies.   We owe $2,552,356 under various convertible promissory notes as of December 31, 2022 including $1,184,044 owed to entities controlled by Ronald P. Erickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Erickson and/or entities with which he is affiliated also have accounts payable and accrued liabilities $297,290 of as of December 31, 2022 related accrued interest and expenses. We may need additional financing, to service and/or repay these debt obligations. If we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing, we may incur substantial interest expense. If and when we raise more equity capital in the future, it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders.    We have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.   We have experienced net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $105,221,000 and net losses in the amount $3,823,000, $20,071,000 and $25,360,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. Our operating expenses may increase as we spend resources on growing our business, and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase, our operating results and financial condition will suffer. Our businesses have produced minimal revenues and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which would harm our ability to continue our operations or obtain additional financing and require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as business with an early-stage technology in a new and rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.   We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our technology and related products to achieve or sustain profitability.     27 Table of Contents   We are in the early stages of commercializing our technology. Failure to develop and sell products based upon our technology, grant additional licenses and obtain royalties or develop other revenue streams will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from sales of our products. We believe that our commercialization success is dependent upon our ability to significantly increase the number of customers that are using our products .
In addition, demand for our products may not materialize, or increase as quickly as planned, and we may therefore be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. We are currently not profitable .  Even if we succeed in introducing our technology and related products to our target markets, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.   We currently rely in part upon external resources for engineering and product development services. If we are unable to secure an engineering or product development partner or establish satisfactory engineering and product development capabilities, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology .   Our success depends upon our ability to develop products that are accurate and provide solutions for our customers. Achieving the desired results for our customers requires solving engineering issues in concert with them. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.   We have not historically had sufficient internal resources which can work on engineering and product development matters. We have used third parties in the past and will continue to do so. These resources are not always readily available, and the absence of their availability could inhibit our research and development efforts and our responsiveness to our customers. Our inability to secure those resources could impact our ability to provide engineering and product development services and could have an impact on our customers’ willingness to use our technology.   We are in the early stages of commercialization and our technology and related products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.   Our success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized as accurate and cost-effective. Many of our potential customers may be reluctant to use our new technology. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our technology and related products are an attractive alternative to existing technologies. We will need to demonstrate that our products provide accurate and cost-effective alternatives to existing technologies. Compared to most competing technologies, our technology is relatively new, and most potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to implementing our technology and related products, some potential customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to testing and validating our products. In addition, during the implementation phase, some customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to training their personnel on appropriate practices to ensure accurate results from our technology and products. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing testing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.   Many factors influence the perception of a system including its use by leaders in the industry. If we are unable to induce industry leaders in our target markets to implement and use our technology and related products, acceptance and adoption of our products could be slowed. In addition, if our products fail to gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and we are unable to expand our customer base, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.   We are dependent on key personnel.   Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management and other personnel, some of whom could be difficult to replace, Our success will depend on the performance of our officers, our ability to retain and motivate our officers, our ability to integrate new officers into our operations, and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team. Our failure to retain and recruit officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, which could harm our ability to develop new products and adversely impact our relationships with existing and future customers. The inability to attract and retain necessary technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel could harm our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products and could adversely affect our business and operating results.   We have limited insurance which may not cover claims by third parties against us or our officers and directors.   We have limited directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and commercial liability insurance policies. Claims by third parties against us may exceed policy amounts and we may not have amounts to cover these claims. Any significant claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, our limited directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may affect our ability to attract and retain directors and officers.     28 Table of Contents   Our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively, our revenue, our financial condition and our results of operations.   We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Obtaining and maintaining a strong patent position is important to our business. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as
ex parte
reexam,
inter parties
review, or post grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.   There can be no assurance that:     · any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid, if challenged;         · patents will be issued for any of our pending applications;         · any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us;         · our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage; or         · any of our products or technologies will not infringe on the patents of other companies.   If we are enjoined from selling our products, or if we are required to develop new technologies or pay significant monetary damages or are required to make substantial royalty payments, our business and results of operations would be harmed.   Obtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.   Legal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.   Claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non-infringing technology.   In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may receive notices that claim we have infringed upon the intellectual property of others. Even if these claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert our attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have not been engaged in litigation but litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.      29 Table of Contents   If we are unable to secure a sales and marketing partner or establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities at our company, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology.
If we are not successful entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements or recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our technology, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.   We may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we must compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize technology without strategic partners or licensees include:     · our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;         · the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and         · unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.   We may engage in acquisitions, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestures that could result in final results that are different than expected .   In the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions, equity investments, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. Such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as impairment expenses related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too many of our shares as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition, and various potential difficulties involved in integrating acquired businesses into our operations.   From time to time, we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines, technologies and businesses. If a divestiture such as this does occur, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain; reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business; and collect the proceeds from any divestitures.   If we do not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition or divestiture transaction, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.   We have made strategic acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future, and if the acquired companies do not perform as expected, this could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.   We may continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on, among other things:     · the availability of suitable candidates;         · higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;         · competition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates;         · our ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions;         · the availability of funds to finance acquisitions and obtaining any consents necessary under our credit facility;         · the ability to establish new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;         · the ability to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and         · the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses.   We may not be successful in effectively integrating acquired businesses and completing acquisitions in the future. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. Acquired businesses may fail to meet our performance expectations. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.     30 Table of Contents   Government regulatory approval may be necessary before some of our products can be sold and there is no assurance such approval will be granted.   Our technology may have a number of potential applications in fields of use which will require prior governmental regulatory approval before the technology can be introduced to the marketplace. For example, we are exploring the use of our technology for certain medical diagnostic applications, with an initial focus on the monitoring of blood glucose.  There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications for our technology. If we were to be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications of our technology, prior clearance by the FDA and other governmental regulatory bodies will be required before the technology could be introduced into the marketplace. There is no assurance that such regulatory approval would be obtained for a glucose monitoring medical diagnostic device or other applications requiring such approval. The FDA can refuse to grant, delay, and limit or deny approval of an application for clearance of marketing a glucose monitoring device for many reasons. We may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to market these glucose monitoring systems in the United States or outside of the United States. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval or clearance for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability.   We or our manufacturers may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory clearances or approvals for our current or future products, or our distributors may be unable to obtain necessary qualifications, which could harm our business.   Sales of our products internationally are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the U.S. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and marketing approval or clearance is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may rely on third-party distributors to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals required in other countries, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If our distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all.   Foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would be required to rely on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our product in foreign countries.   Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could result in the compromise of confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to customers, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business and operations.   Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures.   These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to malfeasance by employees, consultants or other service providers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom crafted against our information systems. Over the past several years, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff.     31 Table of Contents   There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to deliver services to our customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   We are subject to corporate governance and internal control requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business.   We must comply with corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as additional rules and regulations currently in place and that may be subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. The financial cost of compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations is expected to remain substantial.   We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules, and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting, and similar matters in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and the value of our securities.    Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock   We may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on NYSE American.   Our common stock is currently listed on NYSE American. We must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain the listing of our common stock on NYSE American. If we fail to meet any listing standards or if we violate any listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock from NYSE American may materially impair our stockholders’ ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. The delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.   The price of our common stock is volatile, which may cause investment losses for our stockholders .   The market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the future to be volatile. Our common stock price may fluctuate in response to factors such as:     · Announcements by us regarding liquidity, significant acquisitions, equity investments and divestitures, strategic relationships, addition or loss of significant customers and contracts, capital expenditure commitments and litigation;         · Issuance of convertible or equity securities and related warrants for general or merger and acquisition purposes;         · Issuance or repayment of debt, accounts payable or convertible debt for general or merger and acquisition purposes;         · Sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock by stockholders;         · General market and economic conditions;         · Quarterly variations in our operating results;         · Investor and public relation activities;         · Announcements of technological innovations;         · New product introductions by us or our competitors;         · Competitive activities;         · Low liquidity; and         · Additions or departures of key personnel.   These broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
32 Table of Contents   The sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock could depress the price of our common stock.   As of December 31, 2022, we had 48,207,937 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 24,480,495 common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling 9,704,620 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 21,736,313 common shares, and 8,108,356 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, we currently have 9,020,264 common shares at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $2,255,066. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the December 31, 2022, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.
Significant shares of common stock are held by our principal stockholders, other company insiders and other large stockholders. As “affiliates,” as defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, our principal stockholders, other of our insiders and other large stockholders may only sell their shares of common stock in the public market pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 144.   These options, warrants, convertible notes payable and convertible preferred stock could result in further dilution to common stockholders and may affect the market price of the common stock.   Future capital raises or other issuances of equity or debt securities may dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.   Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent that common stock is available for issuance, subject to compliance with applicable stock exchange listing rules, our board of directors has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of any additional shares could, among other things, result in substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of issuance, result in substantial dilution of our earnings per share and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.   Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of our common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.   In the future, we may also attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. These debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets.   Because our decision to issue securities or incur debt in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financing. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, you will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of your shares and diluting your interest in us.
The exercise prices of certain warrants, and the conversion prices of our outstanding convertible notes payable and our preferred stock may require further adjustment.     If in the future, if we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of series C convertible preferred stock and series D convertible preferred stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 10,074,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,424,425 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.   If our company were to dissolve or wind-up operations, holders of our common stock would not receive a liquidation preference.   If we were to wind-up or dissolve our company and liquidate and distribute our assets, our common stockholders would share in our assets only after we satisfy any amounts we owe to our creditors and preferred equity holders.  If our liquidation or dissolution were attributable to our inability to profitably operate our business, then it is likely that we would have material liabilities at the time of liquidation or dissolution.  Accordingly, it is very unlikely that sufficient assets will remain available after the payment of our creditors and preferred equity holders to enable common stockholders to receive any liquidation distribution with respect to any common stock.      33 Table of Contents   We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.   If securities industry analysts do not publish research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.   Any trading market for our common stock may be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities industry analysts. If no securities industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event we are covered by analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our common stock, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.   If our securities become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our common stock.   The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on NYSE American or another national securities exchange and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock could be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their common stock.   Anti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire our company, which could cause our stock price to decline.   Our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Nevada law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring our company, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.     ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had the following unregistered sales of equity securities:   We issued 50,000 shares of common stock related to the exercise of warrants and received $12,500.   We issued 1,875 shares related to the exercise of stock option grants and received $2,343.   ITEM 3.
