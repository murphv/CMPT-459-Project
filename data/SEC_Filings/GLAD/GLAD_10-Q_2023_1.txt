191.7 % $ 640,776   $ 621,739   (A) Certain of the securities listed in this schedule are issued by affiliate(s) of the indicated portfolio company. The majority of the securities listed, totaling $ 555.5
million at fair value, are pledged as collateral under our revolving line of credit, as described further in Note 5— Borrowings
in the accompanying
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), we may not acquire any non-qualifying assets unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least
70 % of our total assets. As of December 31, 2022, our investments in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. (“Leeds”), Funko Acquisition Holdings, LLC (“Funko”), and B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”)
are considered non-qualifying assets under Section 55 of the 1940 Act. Such non-qualifying assets represent
0.4 % of total investments, at fair value, as of December 31, 2022.
(B) Unless indicated otherwise, all cash interest rates are indexed to 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR” or “L”), which was
4.39 % as of December 31, 2022 or one- month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR” or “S”), which was
4.36 % as of December 31, 2022. If applicable, paid-in-kind (“PIK”) interest rates are noted separately from the cash interest rate. Certain securities are subject to an interest rate floor. The cash interest rate is the greater of the floor or the reference rate plus a spread. Due dates represent the contractual maturity date. (C) Fair value was based on an internal yield analysis or on estimates of value submitted by ICE Data Pricing and Reference Data, LLC (“ICE”). (D) Fair value was based on the indicative bid price on or near December 31, 2022, offered by the respective syndication agent’s trading desk. (E) Fair value was based on the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, which was then allocated to the portfolio company’s securities in order of their relative priority in the capital structure. (F) Debt security has a fixed interest rate. (G) Security is non-income producing. (H) The Company has entered into an agreement that entitles it to the "last out" tranche of the first lien secured loans, whereby the "first out" tranche will receive priority as to the "last out" tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest, and any other amounts due thereunder. Therefore, the Company receives a higher interest rate than the contractual stated interest rate of LIBOR plus
6.5 % (Floor
1.0 %) per the credit agreement and the Consolidated Schedule of Investments above reflects such higher rate. (I) Represents the principal balance for debt investments and the number of shares/units held for equity investments. Warrants are represented as a percentage of ownership, as applicable. (J) Where applicable, aggregates all shares of a class of stock owned without regard to specific series owned within such class (some series of which may or may not be voting shares) or aggregates all warrants to purchase shares of a class of stock owned without regard to specific series of such class of stock such warrants allow us to purchase. (K) Category percentages represent the fair value of each category and subcategory as a percentage of net assets as of December 31, 2022. (L) There are certain limitations on our ability to withdraw our partnership interest prior to dissolution of the entity, which must occur no later than May 9, 2024 or
two years
after all outstanding leverage has matured. (M) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those that are neither Control nor Affiliate investments and in which we own less than 5.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities.
(N) Affiliate investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those in which we own, with the power to vote, between and inclusive of 5.0% and 25.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities. (O) Control investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those where we have the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the portfolio company, which may include owning, with the power to vote, more than 25.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities. (P) Debt security is on non-accrual status.
(Q) Investment maturity date has passed.
Investment continues to make applicable interest payments.
(R) Fair value was based on net asset value provided by the fund as a practical expedient. (S) One of our affiliated funds, Gladstone Investment Corporation, co-invested with us in this portfolio company pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(T) Our investment in Funko was valued using Level 2 inputs within the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) fair value hierarchy. Our common units in Funko are convertible to class A common stock in Funko, Inc. upon meeting certain requirements. Fair value was based on the closing market price of shares of Funko, Inc. as of the reporting date, less a discount for lack of marketability. Funko, Inc. is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “FNKO.” Refer to Note 3— Investments

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), we may not acquire any non-qualifying assets unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least
70 % of our total assets. As of September 30, 2022, our investments in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. (“Leeds”) and Funko Acquisition Holdings, LLC (“Funko”) are considered non-qualifying assets under Section 55 of the 1940 Act. Such non-qualifying assets represent
1.0 % of total investments, at fair value, as of September 30, 2022. (B) Unless indicated otherwise, all cash interest rates are indexed to 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR” or “L”), which was
3.14 % as of September 30, 2022. If applicable, paid-in-kind (“PIK”) interest rates are noted separately from the cash interest rate. Certain securities are subject to an interest rate floor. The cash interest rate is the greater of the floor or LIBOR plus a spread. Due dates represent the contractual maturity date. (C) Fair value was based on an internal yield analysis or on estimates of value submitted by ICE Data Pricing and Reference Data, LLC (“ICE”). (D) Fair value was based on the indicative bid price on or near September 30, 2022, offered by the respective syndication agent’s trading desk. (E) Fair value was based on the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, which was then allocated to the portfolio company’s securities in order of their relative priority in the capital structure. (F) Debt security has a fixed interest rate. (G) Security is non-income producing. THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 18 Table of Contents (H) The Company has entered into an agreement that entitles it to the "last out" tranche of the first lien secured loan, whereby the "first out" tranche will receive priority as to the "last out" tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest, and any other amounts due thereunder. Therefore, the Company receives a higher interest rate than the contractual stated interest rate of LIBOR plus
6.50 % (Floor
1.0 %) per the credit agreement and the Consolidated Schedule of Investments above reflects such higher rate. (I) Represents the principal balance for debt investments and the number of shares/units held for equity investments. Warrants are represented as a percentage of ownership, as applicable. (J) Where applicable, aggregates all shares of a class of stock owned without regard to specific series owned within such class (some series of which may or may not be voting shares) or aggregates all warrants
to
purchase shares
of
a class of stock owned without regard to specific series of such class of stock such warrants allow us
to
purchase. (K) Category percentages represent the fair value of each category and subcategory as a percentage of net assets as of September 30, 2022.

two years
after all outstanding leverage has matured. (M) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those that are neither Control nor Affiliate investments and in which we own less than 5.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities. (N) Affiliate investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those in which we own, with the power to vote, between and inclusive of 5.0% and 25.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities. (O) Control investments, as defined by the 1940 Act, are those where we have the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the portfolio company, which may include owning, with the power to vote, more than 25.0% of the issued and outstanding voting securities. (P) Debt security does not have a stated interest rate that is payable thereon. (Q) Investment maturity date has passed. Investment continues to make applicable interest payments. (R) Fair value was based on net asset value provided by the fund as a practical expedient. (S) One of our affiliated funds, Gladstone Investment Corporation, co-invested with us in this portfolio company pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (T) Our investment in Funko was valued using Level 2 inputs within the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" (“ASC 820”) fair value hierarchy. Our common units in Funko are convertible to class A common stock in Funko, Inc. upon meeting certain requirements.

ORGANIZATION Gladstone Capital Corporation was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2001 and completed an initial public offering on August 24, 2001. The terms “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” all refer to Gladstone Capital Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), and are applying the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946 “Financial Services-Investment Companies” (“ASC 946”).
In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
We were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the United States (“U.S.”).
Our investment objectives are to:
(1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established lower middle market companies (which we generally define as companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $ 3
million to $ 15
million) in the U.S. that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains.
Gladstone Business Loan, LLC (“Business Loan”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was established on February 3, 2003, for the sole purpose of holding certain investments pledged as collateral to our line of credit. The financial statements of Business Loan are consolidated with those of Gladstone Capital Corporation. We may also have significant subsidiaries (as defined under Rule 1-02(w)(2) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Regulation S-X) whose financial statements are not consolidated with ours.
We did not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries that met any of the significance conditions under Rule 1-02(w)(2) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X as of or during the three month periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
We are externally managed by Gladstone Management Corporation (the “Adviser”), an affiliate of ours and an SEC registered investment adviser, pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Advisory Agreement”).
Administrative services are provided by Gladstone Administration, LLC (the “Administrator”), an affiliate of ours and the Adviser, pursuant to an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”). Refer to Note 4— Related Party Transactions
for additional information regarding these arrangements. NOTE 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and Basis of Presentation We prepare our interim financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, we have not included in this quarterly report all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. The accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements
include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we do not consolidate portfolio company investments. Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, codified in ASC 946, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company, except that ASC 946 provides for the consolidation of a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to the investment company or its consolidated subsidiaries.
In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair statement of financial statements for the interim periods have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending
20 Table of Contents September 30, 2023 or any future interim periods. The interim financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022. Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements
and these
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . Actual results may differ from those estimates. Investment Valuation Policy Accounting Recognition We record our investments at fair value in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) and the 1940 Act. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date.
Realized gains or losses are generally measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation primarily reflects the change in investment fair values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.
Board Responsibility In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which permits a BDC’s board of directors to designate its investment adviser as a valuation designee (the “Valuation Designee”) to perform fair value determinations for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of such board. Our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) has approved investment valuation policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the “Policy”) and, in July 2022, designated the Adviser to serve as the Board of Directors’ Valuation Designee. In accordance with the 1940 Act, our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for reviewing and determining, in good faith, the fair value of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available based on our Policy and for overseeing the Valuation Designee. Such review and oversight includes receiving written fair value determinations and supporting materials provided by the Valuation Designee, in coordination with the Administrator and with the oversight by the Company’s chief valuation officer (collectively, the “Valuation Team”). The Valuation Committee of our Board of Directors (comprised entirely of independent directors) meets to review the valuation determinations and supporting materials, discusses the information provided by the Valuation Team, determines whether the Valuation Team has followed the Policy, and reviews other facts and circumstances, including current valuation risks, conflicts of interest, material valuation matters, appropriateness of valuation methodologies, back-testing results, price challenges/overrides, and ongoing monitoring and oversight of pricing services. After the Valuation Committee concludes its meeting, it and the chief valuation officer, representing the Valuation Designee, present the Valuation Committee’s findings on the Valuation Designee's recommendations to the entire Board of Directors so that the full Board of Directors may review and approve in good faith the Valuation Designee’s determined fair values of such investments in accordance with the Policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value (especially for privately-held businesses), as fair value depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of each individual investment. In determining the fair value of our investments, the Valuation Team, led by the chief valuation officer, uses the Policy, and each quarter the Valuation Committee and Board of Directors review the Policy to determine if changes thereto are advisable and whether the Valuation Team has applied the Policy consistently. Use of Third Party Valuation Firms The Valuation Team engages third party valuation firms to provide independent assessments of fair value of certain of our investments.
ICE Data Pricing and Reference Data, LLC (“ICE”), a valuation specialist, generally provides estimates of fair value on our proprietary debt investments. The Valuation Team generally assigns ICE’s estimates of fair value to our debt investments where we do not have the ability to effectuate a sale of the applicable portfolio company. The Valuation Team
21 Table of Contents corroborates ICE’s estimates of fair value using one or more of the valuation techniques discussed below. The Valuation Team’s estimate of value on a specific debt investment may significantly differ from ICE’s. When this occurs, our Valuation Committee and Board of Directors review whether the Valuation Team has followed the Policy and whether the Valuation Team’s recommended fair value is reasonable in light of the Policy and other facts and circumstances before determining fair value. We may engage other independent valuation firms to provide earnings multiple ranges, as well as other information, and evaluate such information for incorporation into the total enterprise value (“TEV”) of certain of our investments.  Generally, at least once per year, we engage an independent valuation firm to value or review the valuation of each of our significant equity investments, which includes providing the information noted above.
The Valuation Team evaluates such information for incorporation into our TEV, including review of all inputs provided by the independent valuation firm.  The Valuation Team then makes a recommendation to our Valuation Committee and Board of Directors as to the fair value.  Our Board of Directors reviews the recommended fair value, and whether it is reasonable in light of the Policy, and other relevant facts and circumstances, as necessary, before determining fair value. Valuation Techniques In accordance with ASC 820, the Valuation Team uses the following techniques when valuing our investment portfolio: • Total Enterprise Value
—
In determining the fair value using a TEV, the Valuation Team first calculates the TEV of the portfolio company by incorporating some or all of the following factors:
the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and other specific portfolio company attributes; the earnings of the portfolio company (the trailing or projected twelve month revenue or EBITDA); EBITDA multiples obtained from our indexing methodology whereby the original transaction EBITDA multiple at the time of our closing is indexed to a general subset of comparable disclosed transactions and EBITDA multiples from recent sales to third parties of similar securities in similar industries; a comparison to publicly traded securities in similar industries; and other pertinent factors.
The Valuation Team generally reviews industry statistics and may use outside experts when gathering this information.
Once the TEV is determined for a portfolio company, the Valuation Team generally allocates the TEV to the portfolio company’s securities based on the facts and circumstances of the securities, which typically results in the allocation of fair value to securities based on the order of their relative priority in the capital structure. Generally, the Valuation Team uses TEV to value our equity investments and, in the circumstances where we have the ability to effectuate a sale of a portfolio company, our debt investments.
TEV is primarily calculated using EBITDA and EBITDA multiples; however, TEV may also be calculated using revenue and revenue multiples or a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a net present value using estimated risk-adjusted discount rates, which incorporate adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity risks. Generally, the Valuation Team uses a DCF analysis to calculate TEV to corroborate estimates of value for our equity investments where we do not have the ability to effectuate a sale of a portfolio company or for debt of credit impaired portfolio companies. • Yield Analysis
—
The Valuation Team generally determines the fair value of our debt investments for which we do not have the ability to effectuate a sale of the applicable portfolio company using the yield analysis, which includes a DCF calculation and assumptions that the Valuation Team believes market participants would use, including, estimated remaining life, current market yield, current leverage, and interest rate spreads. This technique develops a modified discount rate that incorporates risk premiums including increased probability of default, increased loss upon default and increased liquidity risk. Generally, the Valuation Team uses the yield analysis to corroborate both estimates of value provided by ICE and market quotes.
• Market Quotes
—
For our investments for which a limited market exists, we generally base fair value on readily available and reliable market quotations which are corroborated by the Valuation Team (generally by using the yield analysis described above). In addition, the Valuation Team assesses trading activity for similar investments and evaluates variances in quotations and other market insights to determine if any available quoted prices are reliable.
Typically, the Valuation Team uses the lower indicative bid price (“IBP”) in the bid-to-ask price range obtained from the respective originating syndication agent’s trading desk on or near the valuation date.
The Valuation Team may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the Policy. For securities that are publicly traded, we generally base fair value on the closing market price of the securities we hold as of the reporting date. For restricted securities that are publicly traded, we generally base fair
22 Table of Contents value on the closing market price of the securities we hold as of the reporting date less a discount for the restriction, which includes consideration of the nature and term to expiration of the restriction. • Investments in Funds
—
For equity investments in other funds for which we cannot effectuate a sale of the fund, the Valuation Team generally determines the fair value of our invested capital at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the fund. Any invested capital that is not yet reflected in the NAV provided by the fund is valued at par value. The Valuation Team may also determine fair value of our investments in other investment funds based on the capital accounts of the underlying entity. In addition to the valuation techniques listed above, the Valuation Team may also consider other factors when determining the fair value of our investments, including:
the nature and realizable value of the collateral, including external parties’ guaranties, any relevant offers or letters of intent to acquire the portfolio company, timing of expected loan repayments, and the markets in which the portfolio company operates.
Fair value measurements of our investments may involve subjective judgments and estimates and due to the uncertainty inherent in valuing these securities, the determinations of fair value may fluctuate from period to period and may differ materially from the values that could be obtained if a ready market for these securities existed. Our NAV could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially different from the values that we ultimately realize upon our disposal of such securities.
Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investment may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities.
If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which it is recorded. Refer to Note 3— Investments
for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of ASC 820.
Revenue Recognition Interest Income Recognition Interest income, including the amortization of premiums, acquisition costs and amendment fees, the accretion of original issue discounts (“OID”), and paid-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when a loan becomes 90 days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to the cost basis depending upon management’s judgment. Generally, non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current, or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of December 31, 2022, loans to Edge Adhesives Holdings, Inc. were on non-accrual status with an aggregate debt cost basis of $ 6.1
million, or
1.1 % of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio, and an aggregate fair value of $ 2.5
million, or
0.4 % of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio. There were
no
loans on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2022. We currently hold, and we expect to hold in the future, some loans in our portfolio that contain OID or PIK provisions. We recognize OID for loans originally issued at discounts and recognize the income over the life of the obligation based on an effective yield calculation. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in a loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of a loan and recorded as income over the life of the obligation. Thus, the actual collection of PIK income may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. To maintain our ability to be taxed as a RIC, we may need to pay out both OID and PIK non-cash income amounts in the form of distributions, even though we have not yet collected the cash on either.
As of each of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we held
four
OID loans, primarily from the syndicated loans in our portfolio. We recorded OID income of $ 49
thousand and $ 0.1
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The unamortized balance of OID investments as of each of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 totaled $ 0.9
million. As of each of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had
six
investments which had a PIK interest component. We recorded PIK interest income of $ 1.0
million and $ 1.1
million during
23 Table of Contents the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We collected $ 0.4
million and $ 12
thousand in PIK interest in cash during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Success Fee Income Recognition We record success fees as income when earned, which often occurs upon receipt of cash. Success fees are generally contractually due upon a change of control in a portfolio company, typically resulting from an exit or sale, and are non-recurring.
Dividend Income Recognition
We accrue dividend income on preferred and common equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected and if we have the option to collect such amounts in cash or other consideration.
Related Party Fees We are party to the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, which is owned and controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer. In accordance with the Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser fees as compensation for its services, consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. Additionally, we pay the Adviser a loan servicing fee as compensation for its services as servicer under the terms of our revolving credit facility with KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”), as administrative agent, lead arranger and lender (as amended and/or restated from time to time, our “Credit Facility”).
These fees are accrued at the end of the quarter when the services are performed and generally paid the following quarter. We are also party to the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, which is owned and controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer, whereby we pay separately for administrative services.

INVESTMENTS Fair Value In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of each investment is determined to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. This fair value definition focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs over entity-specific inputs. ASC 820 also establishes the following three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of a financial instrument as of the measurement date. • Level 1
— inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical financial instruments in active markets; • Level 2
— inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar financial instruments in active or inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the financial instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers; and • Level 3
— inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the financial instrument and can include the Valuation Team’s assumptions based upon the best available information.
When a determination is made to classify our investments within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, such determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable, or Level 3, inputs, observable inputs (or components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Investments in funds measured using NAV as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
24 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, all of our investments were valued using Level 3 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, except for our investment in B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”), which was valued using Level 1 inputs, our investment in Funko Acquisition Holdings, LLC (“Funko”), which was valued using Level 2 inputs, and our investment in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. (“Leeds”), which was valued using NAV as a practical expedient. As of September 30, 2022, all of our investments were valued using Level 3 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, except for our investments in Funko, which was valued using Level 2 inputs, and our investment in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. (“Leeds”), which was valued using NAV as a practical expedient.
We transfer investments in and out of Level 1, 2, and 3 of the valuation hierarchy as of the beginning balance sheet date, based on changes in the use of observable and unobservable inputs utilized to perform the valuation for the period. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no investments transferred into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our investments, by security type, at fair value were categorized as follows within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy: Fair Value Measurements Fair Value Quoted Prices in

Fair value measurements can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the valuation inputs.
Changes in discount rates, EBITDA or EBITDA multiples (or revenue or revenue multiples), each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of our investments.
Generally, an increase/(decrease) in market yields or, discount rates, or a (decrease)/increase in EBITDA or EBITDA multiples (or revenue or revenue multiples) may result in a (decrease)/increase, respectively, in the fair value of certain of our investments. 27 Table of Contents Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements of Investments

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions with the Adviser We have been externally managed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement since October 1, 2004 pursuant to which we pay the Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. On July 12, 2022, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or interested persons of us or the Adviser, unanimously approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement through August 31, 2023. We also pay the Adviser a loan servicing fee for its role of servicer pursuant to our Credit Facility. The entire loan servicing fee paid to the Adviser by Business Loan is non-contractually, unconditionally and irrevocably credited against the base management fee otherwise payable to the Adviser, since Business Loan is a consolidated subsidiary of ours, and overall, the base management fee (including any loan servicing fee) cannot exceed
1.75 % of total assets (including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings) during any given fiscal year pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Two of our executive officers, David Gladstone (our chairman and chief executive officer) and Terry Lee Brubaker (our vice chairman and chief operating officer), serve as directors and executive officers of the Adviser, which is
100 % indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone. Robert Marcotte (our president) also serves as executive vice president of private equity (debt) of the Adviser. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary (who also serves as the Administrator’s president, general counsel and secretary), is also the executive vice president of administration of our Adviser. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the base management fee, incentive fee, and loan servicing fee and associated non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits reflected in our accompanying

(B) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations .
Base Management Fee The base management fee is payable quarterly to the Adviser pursuant to our Advisory Agreement and is assessed at an annual rate of
1.75 %, computed on the basis of the value of our average total assets at the end of the two most recently-completed quarters (inclusive of the current quarter), which are total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period.
Additionally, pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Adviser makes available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. The Adviser may also provide other services to our portfolio companies under certain agreements and may receive fees for services other than managerial assistance. Such services may include: (i) assistance obtaining, sourcing or structuring credit facilities, long-term loans or additional equity from unaffiliated third parties; (ii) negotiating important contractual financial relationships; (iii) consulting services regarding restructuring of the portfolio company and financial modeling as it relates to raising additional debt and equity capital from unaffiliated third parties; and (iv) taking a primary role in interviewing, vetting and negotiating employment contracts with candidates in connection with adding and retaining key portfolio company management team members. The Adviser non-contractually, unconditionally, and irrevocably credits
100 % of any fees for such services against the base management fee that we would otherwise be required to pay to the Adviser. Our Board of Directors accepted a non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credit from the Adviser to reduce the annual base management fee on syndicated loan participations to
0.5 %, to the extent that proceeds resulting from borrowings were used to purchase such syndicated loan participations, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Loan Servicing Fee The Adviser also services the loans held by Business Loan (the borrower under the Credit Facility), in return for which the Adviser receives a
1.5 % annual fee payable monthly based on the aggregate outstanding balance of loans pledged under our Credit Facility. As discussed in the notes to the table above, we treat payment of the loan servicing fee pursuant to the
32 Table of Contents Credit Facility as a pre-payment of the base management fee under the Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, these loan servicing fees are
100 % non-contractually, unconditionally and irrevocably credited back to us by the Adviser.
Incentive Fee The incentive fee consists of two parts: an income-based incentive fee and a capital gains-based incentive fee. The income-based incentive fee rewards the Adviser if our quarterly net investment income (before giving effect to any incentive fee) exceeds
1.75 % ( 2.0 % during the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2023) of our net assets, which we define as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable or contractually due but not payable during the period, at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period (the “hurdle rate”). The income-based incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income is generally payable quarterly to the Adviser and is computed as follows: • no
incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; • 100.0 % of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than
2.1875 % ( 2.4375 % during the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and
2.50 % from April 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023) of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter; and
• 20.0 % of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds
2.1875 % ( 2.4375 % during the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and
2.50 % from April 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023) of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter. On April 12, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an amendment of the Advisory Agreement which extended the temporary revision to the hurdle rate through March 31, 2023 and increased the excess incentive fee hurdle rate from
2.1875 % per quarter ( 8.75 % annualized) to
2.50 % per quarter ( 10.0 % annualized), up from the
2.4375 % per quarter ( 9.75 % annualized) in effect since April 1, 2020.
The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains-based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals
20.0 % of our “net realized capital gains” (as defined herein) as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains-based incentive fee payable to the Adviser, we calculate “net realized capital gains” at the end of each applicable year by subtracting the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and our entire portfolio’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains.
For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the original cost of such investment since inception. The entire portfolio’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, equals the sum of the difference between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the original cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable fiscal year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains-based incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less the entire portfolio’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any.
If this number is positive at the end of such fiscal year, then the capital gains-based incentive fee for such year equals
20.0 % of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains-based incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years. No capital gains-based incentive fee has been recorded or paid since our inception through December 31, 2022, as cumulative unrealized capital depreciation has exceeded cumulative realized capital gains net of cumulative realized capital losses. In accordance with GAAP, a capital gains-based incentive fee accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires us to record a capital gains-based incentive fee equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains-based incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. GAAP requires that the capital gains-based incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains-based incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital
33 Table of Contents appreciation will be realized in the future. No GAAP accrual for a capital gains-based incentive fee has been recorded from our inception through December 31, 2022. Transactions with the Administrator We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide administrative services. We reimburse the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement for the portion of expenses the Administrator incurs while performing services for us. The Administrator’s expenses are primarily rent and the salaries, benefits and expenses of the Administrator’s employees, including: our chief financial officer and treasurer, chief compliance officer, chief valuation officer, and general counsel and secretary (who also serves as the Administrator’s president, general counsel and secretary) and their respective staffs. Two of our executive officers, David Gladstone (our chairman and chief executive officer) and Terry Lee Brubaker (our vice chairman and chief operating officer) serve as members of the board of managers and executive officers of the Administrator, which, as of December 31, 2022, is
100 % indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone. Another of our officers, Michael LiCalsi (our general counsel and secretary), serves as the Administrator’s president as well as the executive vice president of administration for the Adviser. Our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses is generally derived by multiplying the Administrator’s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time during the current quarter the Administrator’s employees performed services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by the Administrator. On July 12, 2022, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not parties to the Administration Agreement or interested persons of either party, approved the renewal of the Administration Agreement through August 31, 2023. Other Transactions Gladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”), a privately-held broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which is
100 % indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer, has provided other services, such as investment banking and due diligence services, to certain of our portfolio companies, for which Gladstone Securities receives a fee. Any such fees paid by portfolio companies to Gladstone Securities do not impact the fees we pay to the Adviser or the non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits against the base management fee or incentive fee. Gladstone Securities received fees from portfolio companies totaling $ 16
thousand and $ 0.6
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Related Party Fees Due Amounts due to related parties on our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities
were as follows: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Base management fee due to Adviser $ 519   $ ( 189 ) Loan servicing fee due to Adviser 456   423   Incentive fee due to Adviser 2,181   1,870   Total fees due to Adviser 3,156   2,104   Fee due to Administrator 499   423   Total Related Party Fees Due $ 3,655   $ 2,527   In addition to the above fees, other operating expenses due to the Adviser as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, totaled $ 19
thousand and $ 44
thousand, respectively. In addition, net expenses payable to Gladstone Investment Corporation (for reimbursement purposes), which includes certain co-investment expenses, totaled $ 16
thousand and $ 13
thousand as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. These amounts are generally settled in the quarter subsequent to being incurred and are included in other liabilities on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. 34 Table of Contents NOTE 5.
BORROWINGS Revolving Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we, through Business Loan, amended and restated the Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) decrease the commitment amount from $ 205.0
million to $ 175.0
million, (ii) extend the revolving period end date to October 31, 2023, (iii) extend the maturity date to October 31, 2025 (at which time all principal and interest will be due and payable if the Credit Facility is not extended by the revolving period end date), (iv) reduce the interest rate margin to
2.70 % during the revolving period and
3.25 % thereafter, with a LIBOR floor of
0.35 %, (v) revise the unused fee to include an additional fee tier of
0.35 % per annum on the daily undrawn amounts if the average unused amount is equal to or less than
35 % during the applicable period, (vi) provide for certain excess concentration limits, including a reduced second lien limit and a new broadly syndicated loan limit and (vii) add customary LIBOR replacement language. We incurred fees of approximately $ 1.1
million in connection with this amendment and restatement, which are being amortized through our Credit Facility’s revolving period end date of October 31, 2023. On September 12, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility to update the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus an
11
basis point credit spread adjustment. On September 20, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility to increase the size of the Credit Facility by $ 50.0  million from $ 175.0  million to $ 225.0  million, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. On October 31, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Facility to increase the size of the Credit Facility by $ 20.0  million from $ 225.0  million to $ 245.0  million, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility.
The following tables summarize noteworthy information related to our Credit Facility: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Commitment amount $ 245,000 $ 225,000 Line of credit outstanding, at cost 108,400 141,800   Availability (A) 111,868 60,068   For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted average borrowings outstanding, at cost $ 129,062   $ 32,967   Weighted average interest rate (B) 6.9   % 7.5   % Commitment (unused) fees incurred $ 156   $ 335   (A)     Available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under our Credit Facility, based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by Business Loan, which varies as loans are added and repaid, regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required.
(B)      Includes unused commitment fees and excludes the impact of deferred financing costs. Our Credit Facility also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank. KeyBank is also the trustee of the account and generally remits the collected funds to us once each month. Amounts collected in the lockbox account with KeyBank are presented as Due from administrative agent on the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Our Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions), and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies without the lenders’ consent. Our Credit Facility also generally limits distributions to our stockholders on a fiscal year basis to the sum of our net investment income, net capital gains and amounts elected to have been paid during the prior year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Business Loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply as collateral towards the borrowing base to receive additional borrowing availability under our Credit Facility, including restrictions on geographic concentrations, sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life and lien property. Our Credit Facility further requires Business Loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Loan to, among
35 Table of Contents other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of 25 obligors required in the borrowing base.
Additionally, we are required to maintain (i) a minimum net worth (defined in our Credit Facility to include any outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock) of $ 325.0
million plus
50.0 % of all equity and subordinated debt raised after May 13, 2021 less
50 % of any equity and subordinated debt retired or redeemed after May 13, 2021, which equates to $ 342.1
million as of December 31, 2022, (ii) asset coverage with respect to “senior securities representing indebtedness” of at least 150% (or such percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act), and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. As of December 31, 2022, and as defined in our Credit Facility, we had a net worth of $ 521.3
million, asset coverage on our “senior securities representing indebtedness” of
202.8 %, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Section 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, and an active status as a BDC and RIC. In addition, we had
32
obligors in our Credit Facility’s borrowing base as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our Credit Facility covenants.
Fair Value We elected to apply the fair value option of ASC 825, “ Financial Instruments ,” specifically for the Credit Facility, which was consistent with our application of ASC 820 to our investments.
Generally, the fair value of our Credit Facility is determined using a yield analysis which includes a DCF calculation and the assumptions that the Valuation Team believes market participants would use, including the estimated remaining life, counterparty credit risk, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our Credit Facility was one-month Term SOFR, plus
2.81 % per annum, plus a
0.75 % unused commitment fee. As of September 30, 2022, the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our Credit Facility was one-month Term SOFR, plus
2.81 % per annum, plus a
0.50 % unused commitment fee. Generally, an increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the DCF calculation may result in a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value of our Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our Credit Facility was valued using Level 3 inputs and any changes in its fair value are recorded in net unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of other on our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations . The following tables present our Credit Facility carried at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, on our accompanying

million and $ 577.6
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Notes Payable In November 2021, we completed a private placement of $ 50.0  million aggregate principal amount of
3.75 % Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) for net proceeds of approximately $ 48.5  million after deducting initial purchasers’ costs, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The 2027 Notes will mature on May 1, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company’s option prior to maturity at par plus a “make-whole” premium, if applicable. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of
3.75 % per year. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year (which equates to approximately $ 1.9  million per year). In April 2022, pursuant to the registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the 2027 Notes, we conducted an exchange offer through which we offered to exchange all of our then outstanding 2027 Notes (the “Restricted Notes”) that were issued on November 4, 2021, for an equal aggregate principal amount of our new
3.75 % Notes due 2027 (the “Exchange Notes”) that had been registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The terms of the Exchange Notes are identical to those of the outstanding Restricted Notes, except that the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the Restricted Notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes, and the Exchange Notes do not provide for the payment of additional interest in the event of a registration default. In December 2020, we completed an offering of $ 100.0  million aggregate principal amount of
5.125 % Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) for net proceeds of approximately $ 97.7  million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. In March 2021, we completed an offering of an additional $ 50.0  million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for net proceeds of approximately $ 50.6  million after adding premiums and deducting underwriting costs, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The 2026 Notes will mature on January 31, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company’s option prior to maturity at par plus a “make-whole” premium, if applicable. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of
5.125 % per year. Interest is payable semiannually on January 31 and July 31 of each year (which equates to approximately $ 7.7  million per year). In October 2019, we completed an offering of $ 38.8  million aggregate principal amount of
5.375 % Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), inclusive of the overallotment option exercised by the underwriters, for net proceeds of approximately $ 37.5  million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. On November 1, 2021, we voluntarily redeemed the 2024 Notes with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $ 38.8  million. The 2024 Notes would have otherwise matured on November 1, 2024. The indenture relating to the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes contains certain covenants, including (i) an inability to incur additional debt or issue additional debt or preferred securities unless the Company’s asset coverage meets the threshold specified in the 1940 Act after such borrowing, (ii) an inability to declare any dividend or distribution (except a dividend payable in our stock) on a class of our capital stock or to purchase shares of our capital stock unless the Company’s asset coverage meets the threshold specified in the 1940 Act at the time of (and giving effect to) such declaration or purchase, and (iii) if, at any time, we are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, we will provide the holders of the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes, as applicable, and the trustee with audited annual consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. The 2027 Notes and 2026 Notes are recorded at the principal amount, plus applicable premiums, less discounts and offering costs, on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The fair value, based on a DCF analysis, of the 2027 Notes as of December 31, 2022 was $ 44.6
million. The fair value, based on a DCF analysis, of the 2026 Notes as of December 31, 2022 was $ 143.6
million. We consider the 2027 Notes and 2026 Notes to be Level 3 within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. NOTE 6.
REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND COMMON EQUITY OFFERINGS
Our shelf registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of $ 300.0
million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to issue up to an additional $ 284.7
million in securities under the registration statement.
Common Stock At-the-Market Offerings 37 Table of Contents In May 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Jefferies LLC, as amended in August 2022 (the “Jefferies Sales Agreement”), under which we have the ability to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $ 60.0  million. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we sold
1,079,806
shares of our common stock under the Jefferies Sales Agreement, at a weighted-average price of $ 9.93
per share and raised approximately $ 10.7  million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds, after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, were approximately $ 10.5
million.
All sales were above our then current estimated NAV per share. As of December 31, 2022, we had a remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $ 37.1
million of our common stock under the Jefferies Sales Agreement. NOTE 7.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS To qualify to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, we must generally distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our taxable ordinary income plus the excess of our net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses (“Investment Company Taxable Income”). The amount to be paid out as distributions to our stockholders is determined by our Board of Directors quarterly and is based on management’s estimate of Investment Company Taxable Income. Based on that estimate, our Board of Directors declares three monthly distributions to common stockholders each quarter.
The federal income tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on the IRS Form 1099 after the end of each calendar year. Estimates of tax characterization made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax characterization of cash distributions for the full year. Estimates made on a quarterly basis are updated as of each interim reporting date.
For the calendar year ended December 31, 2022,
93.2 % of distributions to common stockholders were deemed to be paid from ordinary income and
6.8 % of distributions were deemed to be return of capital for 1099 stockholder reporting purposes. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2021,
100.0 % of distributions to common stockholders were deemed to be paid from ordinary income for 1099 stockholder reporting purposes.
We paid the following monthly distributions to common stockholders for the
three
months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 : Fiscal Year Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Common Share 2023 October 11, 2022 October 21, 2022 October 31, 2022 $ 0.07   October 11, 2022 November 18, 2022 November 30, 2022 0.07   October 11, 2022 December 20, 2022 December 30, 2022 0.07   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022: $ 0.21   38 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Common Share 2022 October 12, 2021 October 22, 2021 October 29, 2021 $ 0.065   October 12, 2021 November 19, 2021 November 30, 2021 0.065   October 12, 2021 December 23, 2021 December 31, 2021 0.065   Three Months Ended December 31, 2021: $ 0.195   Aggregate distributions declared and paid to our common stockholders were approximately $ 7.4
million and $ 6.7  million for the
three
months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 , respectively, and were declared based on estimates of Investment Company Taxable Income for the respective fiscal years. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, distributions declared and paid exceeded taxable income available for common distributions resulting in a partial return of capital of approximately $ 1.4
million. For the
three
months ended December 31, 2022 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded the following adjustments for book-tax differences to reflect tax character.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceedings We are party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. We are required to establish reserves for litigation matters where those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and estimable, we do not establish reserves. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe that loss contingencies, if any, arising from pending investigations, litigation or regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, based on our current knowledge, we do not believe such loss contingencies are both probable and estimable and therefore, as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had no established reserves for such loss contingencies. Escrow Holdbacks From time to time, we enter into arrangements relating to exits of certain investments whereby specific amounts of the proceeds are held in escrow to be used to satisfy potential obligations, as stipulated in the sales agreements. We record escrow amounts in Restricted cash and cash equivalents, if received in cash but subject to potential obligations or other contractual restrictions, or as escrow receivables in Other assets, net, if not yet received in cash, on our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities . We establish reserves and holdbacks against escrow amounts if we determine that it is probable and estimable that a portion of the escrow amounts will not ultimately be released or received at the end of the escrow period. Reserves and holdbacks against escrow amounts were $ 1.5
million and $ 0.2
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Financial Commitments and Obligations We have lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, and an uncalled capital commitment with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn. Since these commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We estimate the fair value of the combined unused lines of credit, the unused delayed draw term loans and the uncalled capital commitment as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 to be immaterial. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the amounts of our unused lines of credit, delayed draw term loans and uncalled capital commitment, at cost, as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, which are not reflected as liabilities in the accompanying

The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements
and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition or results of operations for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts in the tables included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated. OVERVIEW General We were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2001. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.
42 Table of Contents We were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established lower middle market businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with each investment generally ranging from $8 million to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment.
We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 90.0% debt investments and 10.0% equity investments, at cost.
As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio was made up of approximately 91.1% debt investments and 8.9% equity investments, at cost. We focus on investing in lower middle market companies (which we generally define as companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3 million to $15 million) in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including the following: the sustainability of the business’ free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower, reasonable capitalization of the borrower, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples and, to a lesser extent, the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We lend to borrowers that need funds for growth capital or to finance acquisitions or recapitalize or refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises. Our targeted portfolio companies are generally considered too small for the larger capital marketplace.
We invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity.
In July 2012, the SEC granted us an exemptive order (the “Co-Investment Order”) that expanded our ability to co-invest, under certain circumstances, with certain of our affiliates, including Gladstone Investment Corporation, a BDC also managed by the Adviser, and any future BDC or closed-end management investment company that is advised (or sub-advised if it controls the fund) by the Adviser, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to the conditions in the Co-Investment Order. Since 2012, we have opportunistically made several co-investments with Gladstone Investment Corporation pursuant to the Co-Investment Order. We believe the Co-Investment Order has
enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone. We are externally managed by the Adviser, an investment adviser registered with the SEC and an affiliate of ours, pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement. The Adviser manages our investment activities. We have also entered into an administration agreement with Gladstone Administration, LLC (the “Administrator”), an affiliate of ours and the Adviser, whereby we pay separately for administrative services.
Additionally, Gladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”), a privately-held broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which is 100% indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer, has provided other services, such as investment banking and due diligence services, to certain of our portfolio companies, for which Gladstone Securities receives a fee. Business Portfolio and Investment Activity In general, our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years, accrue interest at variable rates (generally based on the 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. We seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or, at a minimum, quarterly, may have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only, with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity.
Generally, success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control of a portfolio company, typically from an exit or sale. Some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid, together with the principal, at maturity. This form of deferred interest is often called paid-in-kind (“PIK”) interest.
43 Table of Contents Typically, our equity investments consist of common stock, preferred stock, limited liability company interests, or warrants to purchase the foregoing.
Often, these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment, recapitalizing a business, or refinancing existing debt.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we extended $11.0 million in investments to existing portfolio companies primarily through draws on existing delayed draw term loan and line of credit commitments. In addition, two
portfolio companies were sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022. We received a total of $39.2 million in combined net proceeds and principal repayments from the aforementioned portfolio company exits, as well as principal repayments by existing portfolio companies, during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our overall portfolio
decreased by $15.3 million at cost since September 30, 2022 and consists of 50 portfolio companies as of December 31, 2022.
From our initial public offering in August 2001 through December 31, 2022, we have made 613 different loans to, or investments in, 268 companies for a total of approximately $2.5 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the following significant transactions occurred: Proprietary Investments • In October and November 2022, we received distributions totaling $6.0 million from our investment in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. (“Leeds”) related primarily to the sale of underlying assets in the fund, which resulted in a realized gain of approximately $4.4 million. We retain an equity investment in Leeds with a cost basis of $0.0 million and fair value of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2022. • In December 2022, our investment in R2i Holdings, LLC paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $19.2 million.
Syndicated Investments • In October 2022, our investment in Targus Cayman HoldCo Ltd. was sold for net proceeds of approximately $8.0 million, which resulted in a realized gain of approximately $5.9 million. As part of the proceeds, we received $2.4 million in aggregate cost basis of B. Riley Financial, Inc. 6.75% senior notes which are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol RILYO.
Capital Raising We have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and amendments to our line of credit with KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”), as administrative agent, lead arranger and lender (as amended and/or restated from time to time, our “Credit Facility”) and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public equity offerings of common stock and public and private debt offerings. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility’s revolving period multiple times, most recently to October 2023, and currently have a total commitment amount of $245.0 million.
We sold 1,079,806 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
In November 2021, we completed a private placement of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes. In December 2020, we completed a debt offering of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In March 2021, we completed a debt offering of an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes.
Refer to
“Liquidity and Capital Resources — Revolving Line of Credit,”
“Liquidity and Capital Resources — Equity — Common Stock,”
and
“Liquidity and Capital Resources — Notes Payable”
for further discussion. Although we have been able to access the capital markets historically and in recent years, market conditions may affect the trading price of our capital stock and thus may inhibit our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity in the future.
When our common stock trades below net asset value (“NAV”) per common share, our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below NAV per common share without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors, other than through sales to our then-existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering.
On December 31, 2022, the closing market price of our common stock was $ 9.62
per share, a
6.2 % premium to our December 31, 2022 NAV per share of $ 9.06 . 44 Table of Contents Regulatory Compliance Our ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have an asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act) of at least 150% on our “senior securities representing indebtedness” and our “senior securities that are stock.”
On April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200% to 150%, effective April 10, 2019. As of December 31, 2022, our asset coverage on our “senior securities representing indebtedness” was 202.8%.
Recent Developments Distributions
On January 10, 2023, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders: Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Common Share January 20, 2023 January 31, 2023 $ 0.075  February 17, 2023 February 28, 2023 0.075  March 17, 2023 March 31, 2023 0.075  Total for the Quarter: $ 0.225   LIBOR Transition In general, our investments in debt securities have a term of five years, accrue interest at variable rates (based on the one-month LIBOR or SOFR) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. Most U.S. dollar LIBOR are currently anticipated to be phased out in June 2023. LIBOR is currently expected to transition to a new standard rate, the SOFR, which will incorporate certain overnight repo market data collected from multiple data sets. The majority of the new variable rate debt investments that we are making are based on SOFR and several of our other existing investments have been transitioned to SOFR. Further, the majority of our outstanding loan agreements for variable rate debt investments that are still based on one-month LIBOR have been amended to include LIBOR replacement language should LIBOR cease to exist. Assuming that SOFR replaces LIBOR, we expect that there should be minimal impact on our operations. In addition, our Credit Facility has been amended to update the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus an 11 basis point credit spread adjustment. Impact of Inflation We believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been
immaterial. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, general inflationary pressures and certain commodity price volatility have impacted our portfolio companies to varying degrees; however, the broad based impact of these pricing changes have largely been mitigated by price adjustments without adverse sales implications, and thus, have not materially impacted our portfolio companies’ ability to service their indebtedness, including our loans. Notwithstanding the results to date, the cumulative effect of these inflationary pressures may, in the future, impact the profit margins or sales of certain portfolio companies and their ability to service their debts. We continue to monitor the current inflationary environment to anticipate any impact on our portfolio companies, including their availability to pay interest on our loans. We cannot assure you that our results of operations and financial condition or that of our portfolio companies will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.

Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $589.6 million, compared to $494.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $95.2 million, or 19.3%. The weighted average yield on our interest-bearing investments is based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments, which increased to 12.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2021,
inclusive of any allowances on interest receivables made during those periods.
The increase in the weighted average yield was driven mainly by increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, loans to Edge Adhesives Holdings, Inc. were on non-accrual status with an aggregate debt cost basis of $6.1 million, or 1.1% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio, and an aggregate fair value of $2.5 million, or 0.4% of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2022, there were no loans on non-accrual status.
Other income decreased by 71.9% during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in success fees and prepayment fees received, period over period. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, no single investment represented greater than 10%   of the total investment portfolio at fair value.
46 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits to fees from the Adviser, increased $3.6 million, or 50.8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in the net base management fee earned by the Adviser and a $1.6 million increase in interest expense. Total interest expense on borrowings and notes payable increased by $1.6 million, or 53.9%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by increased borrowings outstanding on our Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate on our Credit Facility.
The weighted average balance outstanding on our Credit Facility was $129.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $33.0 million in the prior year period, an increase of 291.2%. The effective interest rate on our Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees incurred, but excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, was 6.9% during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 7.5% during the prior year period. The decrease in the effective interest rate was driven primarily by a $0.2 million decrease in unused commitment fees during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year period. The net base management fee earned by the Adviser increased by $1.8 million, or 303.5%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, resulting from a decrease in credits to the base management fee from the Adviser period over period and an increase in average total assets subject to the base management fee. The base management, loan servicing and incentive fees, and associated non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits, are computed quarterly, as described under

Consolidated Statements of Operations . Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $9.3 million, which resulted primarily from a $5.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Targus Cayman HoldCo,
47 Table of Contents Ltd. in October 2022 and a $4.4 million realized gain recognized on our investment in Leeds Novamark Capital I, L.P. in November 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $13.9 million, which resulted primarily from a $13.4 million realized gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Lignetics, Inc. in November 2021. Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of investments in the aggregate amount of $12.6 million. The net realized gain (loss) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) across our investments for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were as follows:

48 Table of Contents During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of investments in the aggregate amount of $10.2 million. The net realized gain (loss) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) across our investments for the three months ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:

Net Realized Loss on Other We incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021, which resulted from the write-off of unamortized deferred issuance costs at the time of redemption of our $38.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) in November 2021. No such amounts were recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily generated from the interest payments on debt securities that we receive from our portfolio companies, as well as net proceeds received through repayments or sales of our investments. We utilize this cash primarily to fund new investments, make interest payments on our Credit Facility, make distributions to our stockholders, pay management and administrative fees to the Adviser and Administrator, and for other operating expenses.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $34.5 million, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of investments, partially offset by a decrease in principal repayments, period over period. Purchases of investments were $13.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $110.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Repayments and net proceeds from sales were $39.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $96.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, we had loans to, syndicated participations in or equity investments in 50 companies, with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $640.8 million. As of September 30, 2022, we had loans to, syndicated participations in or equity investments in 52 companies, with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $656.1 million.

Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $30.4 million, which consisted primarily of $33.4 million in net repayments on our Credit Facility and $7.4 million in distributions to our common shareholders, partially offset by $10.7 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity distribution agreement with Jefferies LLC. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was $6.4 million, which consisted primarily of $50.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 2027 Notes, partially offset by $38.8 million used in the redemption of our 2024 Notes. 50 Table of Contents Distributions to Stockholders Common Stock Distributions To qualify to be taxed as a RIC and thus avoid corporate level federal income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required to distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90.0% of our Investment Company Taxable Income. Additionally, our Credit Facility has a covenant that generally restricts the amount of distributions to stockholders that we can pay out to be no greater than our aggregate net investment income, net capital gains and amounts elected to have been paid during the prior year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. In accordance with these requirements, we paid monthly cash distributions of $0.07 per common share for each month for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $0.065 per common share for each month for the three months ended December 31, 2021. These distributions totaled an aggregate of $7.4 million and $6.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In January 2023, our Board of Directors declared a monthly distribution of $0.075 per common share for each of January, February, and March 2023. Our Board of Directors declared these distributions to our stockholders based on our estimates of our Investment Company Taxable Income for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have paid 239 monthly or quarterly consecutive distributions to common stockholders totaling approximately $431.0 million or $22.04 per share.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, distributions declared and paid exceeded taxable income available for common distributions resulting in a partial return of capital of approximately $1.4 million.
The characterization of the common stockholder distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 will be determined at fiscal year end, based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full fiscal year. Such a characterization made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual full fiscal year characterization.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan Our common stockholders who hold their shares through our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc. (“Computershare”), have the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan offered by Computershare, as the plan agent. This is an “opt in” dividend reinvestment plan, meaning that common stockholders may elect to have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Common stockholders who do make such election will receive their distributions in cash. Common stockholders who receive distributions in the form of stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. The common stockholder will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution. The additional shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the date on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder’s account. Computershare purchases shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan.
Equity Registration Statement Our shelf registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to issue up to $284.7 million in securities under the registration statement.
Common Stock We anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future.
However, we cannot determine the timing or terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us, or at all.
To the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our NAV per share, we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock, other than pursuant to stockholder and independent director approval or a rights offering to existing common stockholders.
On December 31, 2022, the closing market price of our common stock was $9.62 per share, a 6.2% premium to our December 31, 2022 NAV per share of $9.06. 51 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we, through Business Loan, amended and restated the Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) decrease the commitment amount from $205.0 million to $175.0 million, (ii) extend the revolving period end date to October 31, 2023, (iii) extend the maturity date to October 31, 2025 (at which time all principal and interest will be due and payable if the Credit Facility is not extended by the revolving period end date), (iv) reduce the interest rate margin to 2.70% during the revolving period and 3.25% thereafter, with a LIBOR floor of 0.35%, (v) revise the unused fee to include an additional fee tier of 0.35% per annum on the daily undrawn amounts if the average unused amount is equal to or less than 35% during the applicable period, (vi) provide for certain excess concentration limits, including a reduced second lien limit and a new broadly syndicated loan limit and (vii) add customary LIBOR replacement language. We incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with this amendment and restatement, which are being amortized through our Credit Facility’s revolving period end date of October 31, 2023. On September 12, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility to update the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus an 11 basis point credit spread adjustment. On September 20, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility to increase the size of the Credit Facility by $50.0 million from $175.0 million to $225.0 million, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. On October 31, 2022, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Facility to increase the size of the Credit Facility by $20.0 million from $225.0 million to $245.0 million, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility.
Interest is payable monthly during the term of our Credit Facility. Available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under our Credit Facility, based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by Business Loan, which varies as loans are added and repaid, regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required.
Our Credit Facility also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank and with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as custodian. KeyBank, which also serves as the trustee of the account, generally remits the collected funds to us once a month.
Our Credit Facility also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank. KeyBank is also the trustee of the account and generally remits the collected funds to us once each month. Amounts collected in the lockbox account with KeyBank are presented as Due from administrative agent on the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Our Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions), and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies without the lenders’ consent. Our Credit Facility also generally limits distributions to our stockholders on a fiscal year basis to the sum of our net investment income, net capital gains and amounts elected to have been paid during the prior year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Business Loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply as collateral towards the borrowing base to receive additional borrowing availability under our Credit Facility, including restrictions on geographic concentrations, sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life and lien property. Our Credit Facility further requires Business Loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Loan to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of 25 obligors required in the borrowing base.
Additionally, we are required to maintain (i) a minimum net worth (defined in our Credit Facility to include any outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock) of $325.0 million plus 50.0% of all equity and subordinated debt raised after May 13, 2021 less 50% of any equity and subordinated debt retired or redeemed after May 13, 2021, which equates to $342.1 million as of December 31, 2022, (ii) asset coverage with respect to “senior securities representing indebtedness” of at least 150% (or such percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act), and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. As of December 31, 2022, and as defined in our Credit Facility, we had a net worth of $521.3 million, asset coverage on our “senior securities representing indebtedness” of 202.8%, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Section 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, and an active status as a BDC and RIC. In addition, we had 32 obligors in our Credit Facility’s borrowing base as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our Credit Facility covenants. Refer to Note 5— Borrowings
of the notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our Credit Facility. 52 Table of Contents Notes Payable In November 2021, we completed a private placement of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) for net proceeds of approximately $48.5 million after deducting initial purchasers’ costs, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The 2027 Notes will mature on May 1, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company’s option prior to maturity at par plus a “make-whole” premium, if applicable. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year (which equates to approximately $1.9 million per year). In April 2022, pursuant to the registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the 2027 Notes, we conducted an exchange offer through which we offered to exchange all of our then outstanding 2027 Notes (the “Restricted Notes”) that were issued on November 4, 2021, for an equal aggregate principal amount of our new 3.75% Notes due 2027 (the “Exchange Notes”) that had been registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The terms of the Exchange Notes are identical to those of the outstanding Restricted Notes, except that the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the Restricted Notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes, and the Exchange Notes do not provide for the payment of additional interest in the event of a registration default. In December 2020, we completed an offering of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) for net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. In March 2021, we completed an offering of an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for net proceeds of approximately $50.6 million after adding premiums and deducting underwriting costs, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The 2026 Notes will mature on January 31, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company’s option prior to maturity at par plus a “make-whole” premium, if applicable. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per year. Interest is payable semiannually on January 31 and July 31 of each year (which equates to approximately $7.7 million per year). In October 2019, we completed an offering of $38.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), inclusive of the overallotment option exercised by the underwriters, for net proceeds of approximately $37.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. On November 1, 2021, we voluntarily redeemed the 2024 Notes with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $38.8 million. The 2024 Notes would have otherwise matured on November 1, 2024. The indenture relating to the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes contains certain covenants, including (i) an inability to incur additional debt or issue additional debt or preferred securities unless the Company’s asset coverage meets the threshold specified in the 1940 Act after such borrowing, (ii) an inability to declare any dividend or distribution (except a dividend payable in our stock) on a class of our capital stock or to purchase shares of our capital stock unless the Company’s asset coverage meets the threshold specified in the 1940 Act at the time of (and giving effect to) such declaration or purchase, and (iii) if, at any time, we are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, we will provide the holders of the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes, as applicable, and the trustee with audited annual consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. The 2027 Notes and 2026 Notes are recorded at the principal amount, plus applicable premiums, less discounts and offering costs, on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We generally recognize success fee income when the payment has been received. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had off-balance sheet success fee receivables on our accruing debt investments of $4.0 million and $4.7 million (or approximately $0.11 per common share and $0.13 per common share), respectively, that would be owed to us, generally upon a change of control of the portfolio companies. Consistent with GAAP, we generally have not recognized our success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned. Due to the contingent nature of our success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect all of these success fees or know the timing of such collections.
Contractual Obligations We have lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, and an uncalled capital commitment with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn.
Since these commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
We estimate the fair
53 Table of Contents value of the combined unused lines of credit, the unused delayed draw term loans, and the uncalled capital commitment as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 to be immaterial.

(C) Includes estimated interest payments on our Credit Facility, 2027 Notes, and 2026 Notes. The amount of interest expense calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of December 31, 2022.
Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by our Board of Directors) as our most critical accounting policy,
which is described in Note 2—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
in the accompanying notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
Additionally, refer to Note 3— Investments
in our accompanying
Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.”
We have also identified our revenue recognition policy as a critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
in our accompanying
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Investment Valuation Credit Monitoring and Risk Rating The Adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance and, in some instances, used as inputs in our valuation techniques. Generally, we, through the Adviser, participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold board seats and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using these statements or comparable information and board discussions, the Adviser calculates and evaluates certain credit statistics. The Adviser risk rates all of our investments in debt securities. The Adviser does not risk rate our equity securities.
For syndicated loans that have been rated by an SEC registered Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”), the Adviser generally uses the average of two corporate level NRSRO’s risk ratings for such security. For all other debt securities, the Adviser uses a proprietary risk rating system. While the Adviser seeks to mirror the NRSRO systems, we cannot provide any assurance that the Adviser’s risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an NRSRO would for these securities.
The Adviser’s risk rating system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the expected loss if there is a default. The Adviser’s risk rating system uses a scale of 0 to >10, with >10 being the lowest probability of default.
It is the Adviser’s understanding that most debt securities of medium-sized companies do not exceed the grade of BBB on an NRSRO scale, so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of AAA, AA or A. Therefore, the Adviser’s scale begins with the designation >10 as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a BBB from an NRSRO; however, no assurance can be given that a >10 on the Adviser’s scale is equal to a BBB or Baa2 on an NRSRO scale.
The Adviser’s risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold.
54 Table of Contents The following table reflects risk ratings for all proprietary loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, representing approximately 97.9% and 97.9%, respectively, of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each period: Rating As of December 31, 2022 As of

As a RIC, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to our stockholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must maintain our status as a BDC and meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to qualify to be taxed as a RIC, we must distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our Investment Company Taxable Income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. Our policy generally is to make distributions to our stockholders in an amount up to 100% of our Investment Company Taxable Income. We may retain some or all of our net long-term capital gains, if any, and designate them as deemed distributions, or distribute such gains to stockholders in cash. To avoid a 4% federal excise tax on undistributed amounts of income, we must distribute to stockholders, during each calendar year, an amount at least equal
to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (to the extent that income tax was not imposed on such amounts) less certain over-distributions in prior years. Under the RIC Modernization Act, we are permitted to carryforward any capital losses that we may incur for an unlimited period, and such capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments.
The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us; conditions affecting the general economy, including public health emergencies, such as COVID-19; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations.
The primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk.
Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds.
As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.
We use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities.
We may use interest rate risk management techniques from time to time to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
All of our variable-rate debt investments have rates generally associated with either the current LIBOR, SOFR or prime rate .
As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of debt investments on a principal basis consisted of the following: Variable rates 91.4  % Fixed rates 8.6  % Total: 100.0  % There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from that disclosed in our Annual Report. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2022 (the end of the period covered by this report), our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness and design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal controls for the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 56 Table of Contents PART II–OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time, we may become involved in various investigation, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters, if they arise, would materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, resolution of these matters will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material legal proceeding, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding pending or threatened against us or any of our subsidiaries. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Our business is subject to certain risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities.  For a discussion of these risks, please refer to the section captioned “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
