Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking” statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the “Exchange Act”), the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”) or in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), all as may be amended from time to time. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Integrated BioPharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) or industry results, to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, changes in general economic and business conditions; loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products by other companies; the timing of regulatory approval and the introduction of new products by the Company; changes in industry capacity; pressure on prices from competition or from purchasers of the Company's products; regulatory changes in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and nutraceutical industry; regulatory obstacles to the introduction of new technologies or products that are important to the Company; availability of qualified personnel; the loss of any significant customers or suppliers; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of the war in Ukraine the tightened labor markets and inflation, and other factors both referenced and not referenced in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“Form 10-K”), as filed with the SEC. Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as the words, “plan”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “project”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “seeks”, or “scheduled to”, or other similar words, or the negative of these terms or other variations of these terms or comparable language, or by discussion of strategy or intentions. These cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the PSLRA with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the “safe harbor” provisions of such laws. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees or indicative of future performance. Important assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements with respect to the Company, include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties affecting their businesses described in Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K and in other filings by the Company with the SEC. Although the Company believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from a projection or assumption in any of its forward-looking statements. The Company’s future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date hereof and the Company does not have or undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless otherwise required by law.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods are unaudited and include the accounts of Company.  Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Presentation of Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods are unaudited and include the accounts of Integrated BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”). The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Rule
8 - 03
of Regulation S- X
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and therefore do
not
include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  However, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results for the periods presented have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022 ( “Form
10 -K”), as filed with the SEC. The

The preparation of the unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the period.  Ultimate results could differ from the estimates of management.  The results of operations for the

Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition.
The Company recognizes product sales revenue, the prices of which are fixed and determinable, when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, when estimated provisions for product returns, rebates, charge-backs and other sales allowances are reasonably determinable, and when collectability is reasonably assured. Accruals for these items are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to sales. The Company’s net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers, less certain related charges for discounts, returns, rebates, charge-backs and other allowances. Cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and all labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing and packaging of the products. Gross margins are affected by, among other things, changes in the relative sales mix among our products and valuation and/or charge off of slow moving, expired or obsolete inventories. To perform revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC
606,
the Company performs the following
five
steps:
●
identification of the promised goods or services in the contract;
●
determination of whether the promised goods or serves are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract;
●
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
●
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and
●
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC
606.
Income Taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective. Tax benefits are recognized when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
not
that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will
not
be realized.

six
months ended
December 31, 2021,

of the allowance on deferred tax assets.
Leases.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long term debt, and long-term debt obligation on our condensed consolidated statement of financial condition.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do
not
provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms
may
include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Earnings Per Share.
Basic earnings per common share amounts are based on weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the incremental shares that would have been outstanding upon the assumed exercise of all potentially dilutive stock options, subject to anti-dilution limitations using the treasury stock method.
The following options and potentially dilutive shares for stock options were
not
included in the computation of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding as the effect of doing so would be anti-dilutive for the

On
May 15, 2019,
the Company, MDC, AgroLabs, IHT, IHT Properties Corp. (“IHT Properties”) and Vitamin Factory (collectively, the “Borrowers”) amended the Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amended Loan Agreement”) with PNC Bank, National Association as agent and lender (“PNC”) and the other lenders party thereto entered into on

as amended on
February 19, 2016.
The Amended Loan Agreement provides for a total of $ 11,585
in senior secured financing (the “Senior Credit Facility”) as follows: (i) discretionary advances (“Revolving Advances”) based on eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory in the maximum amount of $ 8,000
(the “Revolving Credit Facility”), and (ii) a term loan in the amount of $ 3,585
(the “Term Loan”). The Senior Credit Facility is secured by all assets of the Borrowers, including, without limitation, machinery and equipment, real estate owned by IHT Properties, and common stock of iBio, Inc. (“iBio Stock”) owned by the Company.  As of
December 31, 2022,
the Company has sold all of its investment in iBio Stock, the proceeds of which were paid to PNC, as disclosed below.  Revolving Advances bear interest at PNC’s Base Rate ( 7.5 % and
4.75 % as of
December 31
and
June 30, 2022,
respectively) or the Eurodollar Rate, at Borrowers’ option, plus
2.50 %. The Term Loan bore interest at PNC’s Base Rate ( 5.0 % as of
June 30, 2022)

Upon and after the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement, and during the continuation thereof, interest shall be payable at the interest rate then applicable plus
2 %. The Senior Credit Facility matures on
May 15, 2024 ( the “Senior Maturity Date”).
The principal balance of the Revolving Advances is payable on the Senior Maturity Date, subject to acceleration, based upon a material adverse event clause, as defined, subjective accelerations for borrowing base reserves, as defined or upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement or earlier termination of the Amended Loan Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Term Loan shall be repaid in
eighty-four
( 84 ) consecutive monthly installments of principal, the
first
eighty-three
( 83 ) of which shall be in the amount of $ 43 , commencing on the
first
business day of
June, 2019,
and continuing on the
first
business day of each month thereafter, with a final payment of any unpaid balance of principal and interest payable on the Senior Maturity Date. The foregoing is subject to customary mandatory prepayment provisions and acceleration upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement or earlier termination of the Amended Loan Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof.  The Company satisfied all the principal payments under the Term Note on
January 3, 2022.
The Revolving Advances are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Loan Agreement and are made in aggregate amounts at any time equal to the lesser of ( x ) $ 8,000
or (y) an amount equal to the sum of: (i) up to
85 %, subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of eligible accounts receivables (“Receivables Advance Rate”), plus (ii) up to the lesser of (A)
75 %, subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of the value of the eligible inventory (“Inventory Advance Rate” and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the “Advance Rates”), (B)
85 % of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as evidenced by the most recent inventory appraisal reasonably satisfactory to PNC in its sole discretion exercised in good faith) and (C) the inventory sublimit in the aggregate at any
one
time (“Inventory Advance Rate” and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the “Advance Rates”), minus (iii) the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount, as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement, of all outstanding letters of credit, minus (iv) such reserves as PNC
may
reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time.
The Amended Loan Agreement contains customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including, without limitation the requirement to use any sales proceeds from the sale of iBio Stock to repay the Term Loan and to prepay the outstanding amount of the Term Note in an amount equal to
twenty-five
percent ( 25 %) of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement) for each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016,
payable upon delivery of the financial statements to PNC referred to in and required by the Amended Loan Agreement for such fiscal year but in any event
not
later than
one hundred twenty
( 120 ) days after the end of each such fiscal year, which amount shall be applied ratably to the outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the maturities thereof. The Amended Loan Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including, without limitation, (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance requirement and (ii) an event of default tied to any change of control as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement. As of
December 31, 2022,
the Company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance requirement and with the required annual payments of
25 % of the Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016
and used the proceeds of $ 96
from the sale of iBio Stock in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2021,
to repay the Term Loan. Additionally, with the required annual payment of
25%
of Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2021,
together with the required monthly installments of
$43,
the Company satisfied all the remaining principal payments required under the Term Note on

Significant Risks and Uncertainties
(a) Major Customers.
In the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
approximately
91 % and
90 %, respectively, of consolidated net sales were derived from
two
customers. These
two
customers are in the Company’s Contract Manufacturing Segment and represented approximately
70 % and
25 % and
73 % and
21 % in the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively of the Contract Manufacturing Segment net sales.  In the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022   and
2021,
approximately
88 % and
90 % of consolidated net sales, respectively, were derived from the same
two
customers and net sales to these
two
customers represented approximately
66 % and
27 % in the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
69 % and
25 % of net sales in the
six
months ended
December 31, 2021,
respectively of the Contract Manufacturing Segment net sales.  Accounts receivable from these
two
major customers represented approximately
87 % and
70 % of total net accounts receivable as of
December 31
and
June 30, 2022,
respectively. Two other customers in the other Nutraceutical Segment, while
not
significant customers of the Company’s consolidated net sales, represented approximately
81 % and
1 % and
34 % and
23 % of net sales of the Other Nutraceutical Segment in the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
and
66 % and
15 % and
23 % and
27 %, of net sales of the Other Nutraceutical Segment in the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively.
The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Major customers are those customers who account for more than
10%
of net sales.
(b) Other Business Risks.
Approximately
75 % of the Company’s employees are covered by a union contract and are employed in its New Jersey facilities. The contract was renewed effective
September 1, 2022
and will expire on
August 31, 2026.
The Company is still experiencing supply chain disruptions relating to fuel refinery and transportation issues as it pertains to both shipping and production of plastics.  These issues
first
arose as result of the COVID- 19
pandemic and other geo-political events. This continues to impact the supply and demand of bottles and caps, key components in the Company's Contract Manufacturing Segment.   Transportation, in general, continues to be an issue in the delay of receiving other raw materials and the Company's ability to meet promised delivery dates to the Company's customers in the Contract Manufacturing Segment.
Additionally, the significant outbreak of this contagious disease in the human population has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for the Company’s products and impact the Company’s operating results.
While the Company hasn’t, to date, seen a significant negative impact in its margins resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, it is experiencing a negative impact on its margins due to inflation and tightened labor markets.

(Unaudited)
During the
first
quarter of calendar
2022,
the war in Ukraine affected the Company’s customer’s business operations in Ukraine and Russia, resulting in the cancelation of some future orders. The war resulted in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affect the cross-border operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, many multinational companies ceased or suspended their operations in Russia. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia by the Company’s customers is uncertain.  Also, there
may
be a shortage of Sunflower Oil products in the near future and this
may
cause delays in production of certain raw materials and
may
require reformulation of products.
Additionally, unrelated to the war, a recent export ban of palm oil products from Indonesia
may
play a role in reformulation of many products.  This
may
cause delays in finished products as these items will need to be reformulated and labels updated and printed with the changes, which
may
cause further delays.

Equity Transactions and Stock-Based Compensation
In
November, 2022,
the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to
538,500
stock options to Company officers and employees. The Company issued
527,000
stock options with an exercise price ranging from $ 0.41
to $ 0.45 , vesting over
three
years, with expiration terms of either
five
or
ten
years from the date of grant.  For the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
the Company incurred stock-based compensation expense of $ 86  and $ 145 , and $ 167  and $ 182 , respectively.  The Company expects to record additional stock-based compensation of $ 501  over the remaining vesting periods of approximately
one
to
three
years for all non-vested stock options.
The Company used the following assumptions to calculate the fair value of the stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the measurement date during the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022:
Risk Free Interest Rate
3.85 % to
4.00 %
Volatility
103.3 % to
116.9 %
Term
4 .5 to 7.5 years
Dividend Rate
0.00 %
Closing Price of Common Stock
$ 0.41
The Company calculates expected volatility for a stock-based grant based on historic daily stock price observations of its common stock during the period immediately preceding the grant that is equal in length to the expected term of the grant. The expected term of the options is estimated based on the Company’s historical exercise rate and forfeiture rates are estimated based on employment termination experience. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields for securities in effect at the time of grants with terms approximating the term of the grants. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model are highly subjective, and can materially affect the resulting valuations.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT ’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANICAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (dollars in thousands)
Certain statements set forth under this caption constitute “forward-looking statements.” See “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional factors relating to such statements. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and Notes thereto included herein and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
The Company is engaged primarily in the manufacturing, distributing, marketing and sales of vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products. The Company’s customers are located primarily in the United States and Luxembourg.
Business Outlook
Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross margin and costs, competition, the tax rate, and potential legal proceedings. We are focusing our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may have an impact on expense levels and gross margin. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations. See the risks described in “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net sales from operations decreased by $2,765 to approximately $24,580 from approximately $27,345 in the six months ended December 31, 2021.    Our net sales in the Contract Manufacturing Segment decreased by $3,154, offset by an increase in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment of $389.  Net sales decreased in our Contract Manufacturing Segment primarily due to decreased sales volumes to Life Extension and Herbalife in the amounts of $2,620 and $504, respectively.  Revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 were higher than the six months ended December 31, 2021 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment by $389, primarily due to MDC Warehousing from increased business from a significant customer in this business segment representing approximately 66% of the revenue in the six months ended December 31, 2022 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment.  This customer represented 23% of revenues in our Other Nutraceutical Segment in the six months ended December 31, 2021.  The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had an operating loss of approximately $3, a decrease of approximately $1,318 from operating income of approximately $1,315 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Our profit margins decreased from approximately 11.6% of net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 8.4% of net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the decreased sales in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of approximately $3,154 and increased direct cost of sales for MDC Warehousing of $248.  Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately $211 or approximately 11.4% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.  Our salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of increased (i) bonuses of $35, (ii) base pay of $32 and (iii) payroll taxes and other employee benefits of $79.  Other expenses increased by $60 primarily as a result of increased professional and consulting fees of $25 and the six month period ended December 31, 2021 had an offset of $23 to general expenses from an insurance claim reimbursement for property losses incurred from Hurricane IDA.
Our revenue from our two significant customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment is dependent on their demand within their respective distribution channels for the products we manufacture for them.  As in any competitive market, our ability to match or beat other contract manufacturers pricing for the same items may also alter our outlook and the ability to maintain or increase revenues.  We will continue to focus on our core businesses and push forward in maintaining our cost structure in line with our sales and expanding our customer base.
-18-
We are still experiencing supply chain disruptions relating to fuel refinery and transportation issues as it pertains to both shipping and production of plastics.  These issues first arose as result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geo-political events.  This continues to impact the supply and demand of bottles and caps, key components in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Transportation, in general, continues to be an issue in the delay of receiving other raw materials and our ability to meet promised delivery dates to our customers in the Contract Manufacturing Segment.
Additionally, the significant outbreak of this contagious disease in the human population has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for the Company’s products and impact our operating results.
During the first quarter of calendar 2022, the war in Ukraine affected our customer’s business operations in Ukraine and Russia, resulting in the cancelation of some future orders. The war resulted in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affect the cross-border operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, many multinational companies ceased or suspended their operations in Russia. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia by our customers is uncertain.  Also, there may be a shortage of Sunflower Oil products in the near future and this may cause delays in production of certain raw materials and may require reformulation of products.
Additionally, unrelated to the war, a recent export ban of palm oil products from Indonesia may play a role in reformulation of many products.  This may cause delays in finished products as these items will need to be reformulated and labels updated and printed with the changes, which may cause further delays.
While we haven’t, to date, seen a significant negative impact to our margins resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, we are experiencing a slight negative impact on our margins due to inflation and tightened labor markets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies in the three months ended December 31, 2022, except as disclosed in Note 1. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation of the Condensed Financial Statements of the Company contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with them are regularly discussed by management with our Audit Committee. Those policies are discussed under “Critical Accounting Policies” in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 and in Note 1. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation of the Condensed Financial Statements of the Company contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 88% and 90%, were concentrated among two customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment, Life Extension and Herbalife. Life Extension and Herbalife represented approximately 66% and 27% and 69% and 25%, respectively, of our Contract Manufacturing Segment’s net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
-20-
Revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 were higher than the six months ended December 31, 2021 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment by $389, primarily due to MDC Warehousing from increased business from a significant customer in this business segment representing approximately 66% of the revenue in the six months ended December 31, 2022 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment.  This customer represented 23% of revenues in our Other Nutraceutical Segment in the six months ended December 31, 2021.    A second customer in our Other Nutraceutical Segment represented 15% and 27% of this segment’s net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
The decrease in net sales of approximately $2,765 was primarily the result of decreased net sales in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of $3,154 primarily due to decreased sales volumes to Life Extension and Herbalife in the amounts of $2,620 and $504, respectively.
Cost of sales.
Cost of sales decreased by approximately $1,658 to $22,513 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $24,171 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 or approximately 7%. Cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales to 91.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 88.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of 7% in the cost of goods sold amount is the result in the change of the product mix sold in the Contract Manufacturing Segment and the decrease in net sales.  The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, was primarily the result of the decreased net sales used to offset the fixed manufacturing overhead.
Selling and Administrative Expenses.
There was an increase in selling and administrative expenses of $211 or approximately 11.4% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.  As a percentage of sales, net, selling and administrative expenses were approximately 8.4% and 6.8% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our salaries and employee benefits increased by $146 and other selling and administrative expenses increased by $65.  Salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of increased (i) bonuses of $35, (ii) base pay of $32 and (iii) payroll taxes and other employee benefits of $79.  Other expenses increased by $60 primarily as a result of increased professional and consulting fees of $25 and the six month period ended December 31, 2021 had an offset of $23 from an insurance claim reimbursement for property losses incurred from Hurricane IDA. No other component of selling and administrative expenses increased or decreased by more than $15 in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2021.
Other income (expense), net.
Other income (expense), net was approximately $26 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $85 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and was composed of:

Our interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $49 from the six-month period ended December 31, 2020, primarily resulting from of lower average daily balances outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility with PNC.
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, we sold our remaining iBio Stock, for a loss of $35 with no such sales in the six months ended December 31, 2021.  Also, in the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had an unrealized gain on the remaining iBio Stock of approximately $27, with an unrealized loss of approximately $42 on the remaining iBio Stock in the six months ended December 31, 2021.  The six months ended December 31, 2021 had net gains on disposal of fixed assets of $21 and income from back office service agreements of $10, with no such income items in the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Net (loss) income.
We had a net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $90 compared to net income of approximately $1,547 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of approximately $1,637 was primarily the result of decreased operating income of $1,318 and the change in the provision for income taxes of $378, offset by the decrease in other expense, net of $59.

For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 91% and 90%, respectively, were concentrated among two customers, Life Extension and Herbalife, in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Life Extension and Herbalife, represented approximately 70% and 25% and 73% and 21%, respectively, of our Contract Manufacturing Segment’s net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2022 were higher than the three months ended December 31, 2021 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment by $40, primarily due to MDC Warehousing from increased business from a significant customer in this business segment representing approximately 81% of the revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2022 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment.  This customer represented 34% of revenues in our Other Nutraceutical Segment in the three months ended December 31, 2021. This was offset by another customer in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment customer with decreased sales of $117. This customer represented 34% and 1% of our Other Nutraceuticals Segment net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
The decrease in net sales of approximately $2,340 was primarily the result of decreased net sales in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of $2,380 primarily due to decreased sales volumes to Life Extension and Herbalife of $1,724 and $349, respectively.
-22-
Cost of sales.
Cost of sales decreased by approximately $1,660 to $11,184 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $12,844 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 or approximately 13%. Cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales to 91.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 88.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of 13% in the cost of goods sold amount is the result in the change of the product mix sold in the Contract Manufacturing Segment and the decrease in net sales.  The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, was primarily the result of the decreased net sales used to offset the fixed manufacturing overhead.
Selling and Administrative Expenses.   There was an increase in selling and administrative expenses of $83, approximately 8.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.  As a percentage of sales, net, selling and administrative expenses were approximately 9.0% and 7.0% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $83 was primarily from an increase in  salaries and employee benefit costs of $60, the offset of $38 to other expenses for damages recovered that were incurred as the result of Hurricane IDA and an increase in professional and consulting fees of $19, offset by a decrease in employee stock compensation expense of $59. No other component of selling and administrative expenses increased or decreased by more than $8 in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2021.
Other income (expense), net.
Other income (expense), net was approximately $12 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $39 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and is composed of:

Our interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $30 from the three-month period ended December 31, 2021, primarily as the result of lower average daily balances outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility with PNC.
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we sold our remaining iBio Stock, for a loss of $35 with no such sales in the three months ended December 31, 2021.  Also, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had an unrealized gain on the remaining iBio Stock of approximately $31, with an unrealized loss of approximately $22 on the remaining iBio Stock in the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The three months ended December 31, 2021 had net gains on disposal of fixed assets of $21 and income from back office service agreements of $5, with no such income items in the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Income tax benefit (expense), net.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 we had a federal income tax benefit of $4 and $444 in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and state income tax expense, net of approximately $14 and $104, in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Net (loss) income.
We had a net loss of $55 in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $1,031 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The decrease of approximately $1,086 was primarily the result of the decrease in operating income of $763 and the change in the provision for income taxes of $350, offset by the decrease in other expense, net of $27.
Seasonality
The nutraceutical business can be seasonal. Due to our current customer base in our contract manufacturing segment, our fiscal quarter ending December 31st each year tends to be more than our average quarterly volume for the other three fiscal quarters in the fiscal year. This increase is based on their forecast of their customer base.
-23-
The Company believes that there are non-seasonal factors that may influence the variability of quarterly results including, but not limited to, general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements. Accordingly, a comparison of the Company’s results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful, and the Company’s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods.
