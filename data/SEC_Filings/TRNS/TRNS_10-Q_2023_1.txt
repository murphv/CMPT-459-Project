NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE
1
–
GENERAL
Description of Business:
Transcat, Inc. (“Transcat,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of accredited calibration services, enterprise asset management services, and value-added distributor of professional grade handheld test, measurement and control instrumentation. The Company is focused on providing services and products to highly regulated industries, particularly the life science industry, which includes pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and other FDA-regulated businesses. Additional industries served include industrial manufacturing; energy and utilities, including oil and gas; chemical manufacturing; FAA-regulated businesses, including aerospace and defense and other industries that require accuracy in their processes, confirmation of the capabilities of their equipment, and for which the risk of failure is very costly.
Basis of Presentation:
Transcat’s unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Rule
10 - 01
of Regulation S- X
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements do
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been included. The results for the interim periods are
not
necessarily indicative of what the results will be for the fiscal year. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended
March 26, 2022
(“fiscal year
2022 ”) contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for fiscal year
2022
filed with the SEC.
Revenue Recognition:
Distribution sales are recorded when an order’s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment. The Company recognizes the majority of its Service revenue based upon when the calibration or other activity is performed and then shipped and/or delivered to the customer. The majority of the Company’s revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and/or our obligation has been fulfilled. Some Service revenue is generated from managing customers’ calibration programs in which the Company recognizes revenue over time using the output method-time elapsed as this portrays the transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for product shipped or services performed. Sales taxes and other taxes billed and collected from customers are excluded from revenue. The Company generally invoices its customers for freight, shipping, and handling charges. Freight billed to customers is included in revenue. Shipping and handling is
not
included in revenue. Provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenue is recorded based upon historical data.
Under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we use judgments that could potentially impact both the timing of our satisfaction of performance obligations and our determination of transaction prices used in determining revenue recognized. Such judgments include considerations in determining our transaction prices and when our performance obligations are satisfied for our standard product sales that include general payment terms that are between net
30
and
90
days.
Revenue recognized from prior period performance obligations for the  third
quarter of the fiscal year ending
March 25, 2023 ( “fiscal year
2023 ”) was immaterial. As of
December 24, 2022 , the Company had
no
unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of greater than
one
year. Pursuant to Topic
606,
the Company applied the practical expedient with respect to disclosure of the deferral and future expected timing of revenue recognition for transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. Deferred revenue, unbilled revenue and deferred contract costs recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 24, 2022
and
March 26, 2022
were immaterial. See Note
4
for disaggregated revenue information.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
Transcat has determined the fair value of debt and other financial instruments using a valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, consists of
three
levels. Level
1
uses observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level
2
uses inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level
3,
which is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or
no
market data exists, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. The carrying amount of debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to variable interest rate pricing on a portion of the debt with the balance bearing an interest rate approximating current market rates, and the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Investment assets, which fund the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, consist of mutual funds and are valued based on Level
1
inputs. At each of
December 24, 2022
and
March 26, 2022 , investment assets totaled $ 0.2
million, and are included as a component of other assets (non-current) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Table of Contents
Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. The Company records compensation cost related to unvested equity awards by recognizing, on a straight-line basis, the unamortized grant date fair value over the remaining service period of each award. Excess tax benefits for share-based award activity are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes. Excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock-based compensation costs for such awards. The Company did
not
capitalize any stock-based compensation costs as part of an asset. The Company estimates forfeiture rates based on its historical experience. During the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023
and fiscal year
2022 , the Company recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $ 2.8  million and $ 1.7  million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions:
The accounts of Cal OpEx Limited (d/b/a NEXA Enterprise Asset Management), an Irish company, Galium Limited (d/b/a Complete Calibrations), an Irish company, and Transcat Canada Inc., all of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, are maintained in the local currencies, the Euro, Euro and Canadian dollar, respectively, and have been translated to U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the amounts representing assets and liabilities have been translated at the period-end rates of exchange and related revenue and expense accounts have been translated at an average rate of exchange during the period. Gains and losses arising from translation of Cal OpEx Limited’s, Galium Limited's and Transcat Canada Inc.’s financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded directly to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders’ equity.
Transcat records foreign currency gains and losses on business transactions denominated in foreign currency. The net foreign currency loss was less than $ 0.1
million in each of the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023
and fiscal year
2022 . The Company continually utilizes short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that its future earnings denominated in Canadian dollars would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does
not
apply hedge accounting and therefore the net change in the fair value of the contracts, which totaled a gain of $ 0.3
million and less than $ 0.1
million during the
first
nine
months of fiscal years
2023
and
2022 , respectively, was recognized as a component of Interest and Other Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying accounts receivables denominated in Canadian dollars being hedged. On
December 24, 2022 , the Company had a foreign exchange contract, which matured in
January 2023,
outstanding in the notional amount of $ 3.0  million. This contract was subsequently renewed and remains in place. The Company does
not
use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes.
Earnings Per Share:
Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock reflect the assumed conversion of stock options and unvested restricted stock units using the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive effect. In computing the per share effect of assumed conversion, proceeds received from the exercise of options and unvested restricted stock units are considered to have been used to purchase shares of common stock at the average market prices during the period, and the resulting net additional shares of common stock are included in the calculation of average shares of common stock outstanding.
For the  third
quarter of fiscal year
2023 , the net additional common stock equivalents had
no
effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the
third
quarter of fiscal year
2022,
the net additional common stock equivalents had a ($ 0.01 ) effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023 , and fiscal year
2022,
the net additional common stock equivalents had a ($ 0.01 ) effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The average shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets of an acquired business. The Company tests goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis during the
fourth
quarter of its fiscal year, or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist. The Company is permitted, but
not
required, to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit’s fair value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
two -step goodwill impairment test. If a quantitative test is deemed necessary, a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value.
Intangible assets, namely customer base and covenants
not
to compete, represent an allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may
not
be fully recoverable. A summary of changes in the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets is as follows (amounts in thousands):

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:
In
June 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued ASU
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326 ), which significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are
not
measured at fair value through net income. The ASU replaces the "incurred loss" model with an "expected credit loss" model that requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets, including trade accounts receivable. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2022.
Allowance for doubtful accounts is the most significant item for the Company under this ASU. As credit losses from the Company's trade receivables have
not
historically been significant, the Company anticipates that the adoption of the ASU will
not
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

LONG-TERM DEBT
On
July 7, 2021,
we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement (the
“2021
Credit Agreement”) with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T”), that amended and restated in its entirety the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement dated as of
October 30, 2017,
as amended by Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement Amendment
1
dated
December 10, 2018
and Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement Amendment
2
(“Amendment Two”) dated
May 18, 2020 ( as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”).
The
2021
Credit Agreement increased the revolving credit commitment (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”) from $ 40.0
million to $ 80.0
million, with a letter of credit subfacility increased from $ 2.0
million to $ 10.0
million, and extended the term of the Revolving Credit Commitment to
June 2026.
The
2021
Credit Agreement amended the definition of Applicable Margin (formerly Applicable Rate under the Prior Credit Agreement), which is based upon the Company’s then current leverage ratio and is used to determine interest charges on outstanding and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility; the amendments reduced the Applicable Margins payable at the
two
highest leverage ratio levels. The
2021
Credit Agreement also amended the definition of Permitted Acquisitions, that is, acquisitions which are permitted under, and
may
be financed with proceeds of, the revolving credit facility, including increasing the aggregate purchase price for acquisitions consummated in any fiscal year from $ 1.0
million to $ 65.0
million during fiscal year
2022
and $ 50.0
million during any subsequent fiscal year, and adding an aggregate purchase price of $ 40.0
million for acquisitions consummated at any time during the term of the
2021
Credit Agreement related to businesses with a principal place of business located in the United Kingdom or the European Union.

Table of Contents
In addition, the
2021
Credit Agreement provides that, assuming
no
event of default, restricted payments up to $ 25.0
million (increased from $ 10.0
million in the Prior Credit Agreement) in the aggregate and $ 10.0
million (increased from $ 3.0
million in the Prior Credit Agreement) in any single fiscal year
may
be used by us to repurchase our shares and pay dividends. The
2021
Credit Agreement modified the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with which we are required to comply. The
2021
Credit Agreement also reduced the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) floor from
1.0 % to
0.25 % and included a mechanism for adoption of a different benchmark rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. The
2021
Credit Agreement also reduced the fixed interest rate on our term loan in the amount of $ 15.0
million (the
“2018
Term Loan”) was reduced from
4.15 % to
3.90 %.
The
2021
Credit Agreement superseded in its entirety, the Prior Credit Agreement. Amendment Two to the Prior Credit Agreement had previously extended the term of the revolving credit facility to
October 20, 2022
and increased the revolving credit commitment to $ 40.0
million.
Amendment Two had modified the definition of the applicable rate used to determine interest charges on outstanding and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility and it amended the definition of permitted acquisitions to amend borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for acquisitions. In addition, Amendment Two had amended the definition of restricted payments to exclude amounts up to $ 2.5
million during each fiscal year used to pay certain employee tax obligations associated with share-based payment and stock option activity, and modified certain restrictions to the Company’s ability to repurchase its shares and pay dividends. Amendment Two also had modified the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with which the Company was required to comply and limited capital expenditures to $ 5.5
million for fiscal year
2021.
Amendment Two also had established a LIBOR floor of
1.0 % and included a mechanism for adoption of a different benchmark rate in the event LIBOR was discontinued.
As of
December 24, 2022 , $ 80.0
million was available under the revolving credit facility, of which $ 42.2  million was outstanding and included in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023 , $ 8.3  million was used for
three  business acquisitions.
As of
December 24, 2022 , $ 7.0  million was outstanding on the
2018
Term Loan, of which $ 2.2
million was included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remainder included in long-term debt. The
2018
Term Loan requires total repayments (principal plus interest) of $ 0.2
million per month through
December 2025.
Interest and Other Costs:
Interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue, at Transcat’s election, at either the variable
one -month LIBOR or a fixed rate for a designated period at the LIBOR corresponding to such period (subject to a
1 % floor during the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2022
and a
0.25 % floor for subsequent periods), in each case, plus a margin. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the
2018
Term Loan accrued at a fixed rate of
4.15 % during the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2022
and accrued at a fixed rate of
3.90 % during the
second
quarter of fiscal year
2022
and accrues at a fixed rate of
3.90 % over the term of the loan for subsequent periods. Unused fees accrue based on the average daily amount of unused credit available on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate margins and unused fees are determined on a quarterly basis based upon the Company’s calculated leverage ratio. The Company’s interest rate for the revolving credit facility for the
first
nine
months of fiscal year  2023
ranged from
1.6 % to
6.0 %.
Covenants:
The
2021
Credit Agreement has certain covenants with which the Company must comply, including a fixed charge ratio covenant and a leverage ratio covenant. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants and requirements during the  third
quarter of fiscal year
2023 . Our leverage ratio, as defined in the
2021
Credit Agreement, was
1.66  at
December 24, 2022 , compared with
1.74
at
March 26, 2022 .
Pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement, we were required to comply with a fixed charge ratio covenant and a leverage ratio covenant, which were modified by the
2021
Credit Agreement. The allowable leverage ratio under the Prior Credit Agreement for the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2022
was a maximum multiple of
4.0
of total debt outstanding compared to EBITDA and non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the preceding
four
consecutive fiscal quarters. The Prior Credit Agreement also had provided that the trailing
twelve -month pro forma EBITDA of an acquired business was included in the allowable leverage calculation. After the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2022,
pursuant to the
2021
Credit Agreement, the allowable leverage ratio is a maximum multiple of
3.0 .
Other Terms:
The Company has pledged all of its U.S. tangible and intangible personal property, the equity interests of its U.S.-based subsidiaries, and a majority of the common stock of Transcat Canada Inc. as collateral security for the loans made under the revolving credit facility.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In
September 2021,
the Transcat, Inc.
2021
Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2021
Plan”) was approved by shareholders and became effective. The
2021
Plan replaced the Transcat, Inc.
2003
Incentive Plan (the
“2003
Plan”). Shares available for grant under the
2021
Plan include any shares remaining available for issuance under the
2003
Plan and any shares that are subject to outstanding awards under the
2003
Plan that are subsequently canceled, expired, forfeited, or otherwise
not
issued or are settled in cash. The
2021
Plan provides for, among other awards, grants of restricted stock units and stock options to directors, officers and key employees at the fair market value at the date of grant. At
December 24, 2022 ,
0.7
million shares of common stock were available for future grant under the
2021
Plan.
The Company receives an excess tax benefit related to restricted stock vesting and stock options exercised and redeemed. The discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation and stock option activity during the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023
and fiscal year  2022
were $ 0.5
million and $ 1.7
million, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units:
The Company grants time-based and performance-based restricted stock units as a component of executive and key employee compensation. Expense for restricted stock unit grants is recognized on a straight-line basis for the service period of the stock award based upon fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of the restricted stock unit grants is the quoted market price for the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. These restricted stock units are either time vested, or vest following the
third
fiscal year from the date of grant subject to cumulative diluted earnings per share targets over the eligible period.
Compensation cost ultimately recognized for performance-based restricted stock units will equal the grant date fair market value of the unit that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance conditions. On an interim basis, the Company records compensation cost based on the estimated level of achievement of the performance conditions. The expense relating to the time vested restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
The Company achieved
82 % of the target level for the performance-based restricted stock units granted in the fiscal year ended
March 28, 2020
and as a result, issued
16
thousand shares of common stock to executive officers and certain key employees during the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2023 . The following table summarizes the non-vested restricted stock units outstanding as of

Total expense relating to restricted stock units, based on grant date fair value and the achievement criteria, was $ 1.7  million and $ 1.2  million in the
first
nine
months of fiscal year  2023
and fiscal year
2022 , respectively. As of
December 24, 2022 , unearned compensation, to be recognized over the grants’ respective service periods, totaled $ 2.7  million.
Stock Options:
The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula that requires assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the option. Expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each award. Options vest either immediately or over a period of up to
five
years using a straight-line basis and expire either
five
years or
ten
years from the date of grant.
We calculate the fair value of the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes model. There were
no
stock options granted during the
three
months ended
December 24, 2022
and
December 25, 2021.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value options granted during the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023
and fiscal year
2022 :

Expected Term (in Years)

Annual Dividend Rate
0.00 %     0.00 %
We calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the expected term. The computation of expected term was determined based on safe harbor rules, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards and vesting schedules. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. We assume
no
expected dividends. Under FASB ASC Topic
718,
“Compensation – Stock Compensation”, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.
During the
first
nine
months of fiscal year
2023 , the Company granted options for
46,000
shares of common stock in the aggregate to Company employees that vest over
three
years and an option for
10,000
shares of common stock to a Board of Directors member that vests over
five
years.
During the
first

Certain of the Company’s acquisition agreements include provisions for contingent consideration and other holdback amounts. The Company accrues for contingent consideration and holdback provisions based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  There is uncertainty of the fair value measurement from the use of significant unobservable inputs if those inputs reasonably could have been different at the reporting date. Changes in those significant unobservable inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value.  As of

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 26, 2022.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Summary
During our third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we had consolidated revenue of $57.4 million. This represented an increase of $6.5 million or 12.8% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. This increase was primarily due to the recently completed acquisitions, strong demand in our Service segment’s highly-regulated end markets and improved market conditions in our Distribution segment, especially rentals.
Our third quarter of fiscal year 2023 gross profit was $16.4 million. This was an increase of $2.8 million or 20.3% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, consolidated gross margin was 28.6%, an increase of 180 basis points, versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. This increase was largely the result of operating leverage on our fixed costs and accretive gross margins from our rental business.
Total operating expenses were $13.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, an increase of $2.0 million or 17.4% when compared to the prior year third quarter. Included in operating expenses during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 were incremental operating expenses related to the acquisitions of Alliance, e2b and Complete Calibrations, investments in technology and higher incentive-based employee costs due to higher sales. As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses were 23.1% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, up 90 basis points from 22.2% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Operating income was $3.2 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 34.0% and operating margin increased from 4.6% to 5.5% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Net income was $1.6 million for each of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022.  The difference between higher operating income and flat net income compared to the prior period is due to higher interest expense.

Total revenue was $57.4 million, an increase of $6.5 million, or 12.8%, in our fiscal year 2023 third quarter compared to the prior fiscal year third quarter.
Service revenue, which accounted for 62.7% and 59.4% of our total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, increased 19.0% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. This year-over-year increase included $2.1 million in revenue from acquisitions, and also included organic revenue growth of 12.0% driven by improvement in end market conditions and continued market share gains.

The growth in Service segment revenue during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 reflected both organic growth and acquisitions.
Within any fiscal year, while we add new customers, we also have customers from the prior fiscal year whose service orders may not repeat for any number of factors. Among those factors are variations in the timing of periodic calibrations and other services, customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions. Because the timing of Service segment orders can vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we believe trailing twelve-month information provides a better indication of the progress of this segment.
The following table presents the trailing twelve-month Service segment revenue for the first, second and third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and each quarter in fiscal year 2022 as well as the trailing twelve-month revenue growth as a comparison to that of the prior fiscal year period:

Our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical, temperature, pressure, physical/dimensional and radio frequency/microwave calibration disciplines. We expect to subcontract approximately 13% to 15% of our Service revenue to third-party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities. We continually evaluate our outsourcing needs and make capital investments, as deemed necessary, to add more in-house capabilities and reduce the need for third-party vendors. Capability expansion through business acquisitions is another way that we seek to reduce the need for outsourcing.

This increase was primarily due to strong demand for rental orders.
Our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 Distribution sales growth, in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons, was as follows:

The change in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 for the Distribution segment reflected organic growth.
Distribution sales orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory, customized products, and other products ordered less frequently, which we do not stock. Backorders are the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Pending product shipments are primarily backorders, but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our service centers prior to shipment, orders required by the customer to be shipped complete or at a future date, and other orders awaiting final credit or management review prior to shipment. Management uses pending product shipments and backorders as measures of our future business performance and financial performance within the distribution segment.
Our total pending product shipments at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 were $9.5 million, an increase of $0.6 million versus the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and an increase of $1.8 million since March 26, 2022. The year-over-year increase in pending product shipments and backorders was a result of the disruption to the supply of products as well as increased orders.

Total gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $16.4 million, an increase of $2.8 million or 20.3% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Total gross margin was 28.6% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, up from 26.8% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, a 180 basis point increase.
Service gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 increased $1.8 million, or 20.1%, from the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Service gross margin was 30.0% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, a 30 basis point increase versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. This increase in gross margin was the result of improved productivity offset by increased start-up costs from new client-based lab implementations.

Our Distribution gross margin includes net sales less the direct cost of inventory sold and the direct costs of equipment rental revenues, primarily depreciation expense for the fixed assets in our rental equipment pool, as well as the impact of rebates and cooperative advertising income we receive from vendors, freight billed to customers, freight expenses and direct shipping costs. In general, our Distribution gross margin can vary based upon the mix of products sold, price discounting, and the timing of periodic vendor rebates offered and cooperative advertising programs from suppliers.

Total operating expenses were $13.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 versus $11.3 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. The year-over-year increase in selling, marketing and warehouse expenses is due to increased expenses related to recent acquisitions, especially acquisition related amortization expense, and higher incentive-based employee costs due to higher sales. The increase in general and administrative expenses includes incremental expenses related to acquired companies, increased payroll costs for new employees and continued investments in technology.
As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses were 23.1% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and 22.2% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of 90 basis points.

Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 24.6% and 26.8%, respectively. The decrease in the tax provision is due to the mix of net income by country. Our quarterly provision for income taxes is affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from year to year. The discrete benefits related to share-based compensation activity in each of the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was less than $0.1 million.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 was flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.  This is primarily due to higher operating income offset by increased interest expense.
Adjusted EBITDA:
In addition to reporting net income, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, non-cash loss on sale of building, and restructuring expense), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of our core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based compensation expense and other items, which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is included. As such, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating our business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our credit worthiness.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA increased to 11.5% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 from 10.7% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share:
In addition to reporting Diluted Earnings Per Share, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, acquisition related stock-based compensation, acquisition amortization of backlog and restructuring expense, on a diluted per share basis), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is an important measure of our operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the GAAP measure of Diluted Earnings Per Share and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure.

Service revenue, which accounted for 62.4% of our total revenue during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and 58.6% of our total revenue during the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, increased $17.8 million, or 20.4%, from the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. This year-over-year increase reflected increased demand from the life sciences and other highly-regulated end markets and included $9.0 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions.
Our Distribution sales accounted for 37.6% and 41.4% of our total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, Distribution sales increased $1.6 million, or 2.7%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022. This increase in revenue was due to increased orders in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and strong demand for rental orders.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements will be met through anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. We believe that these sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
On July 7, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T”), that amended and restated in its entirety the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement dated as of October 30, 2017, as amended by Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement Amendment 1 dated December 10, 2018 and Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement Amendment 2 (“Amendment Two”) dated May 18, 2020 (as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”).
The 2021 Credit Agreement increased the revolving credit commitment (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”) from $40.0 million to $80.0 million, with a letter of credit subfacility increased from $2.0 million to $10.0 million, and extended the term of the Revolving Credit Commitment to June 2026. The 2021 Credit Agreement amended the definition of Applicable Margin (formerly Applicable Rate under the Prior Credit Agreement), which is based upon our then current leverage ratio and is used to determine interest charges on outstanding and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility; the amendments reduced the Applicable Margins payable at the two highest leverage ratio levels. The 2021 Credit Agreement also amended the definition of Permitted Acquisitions, that is, acquisitions which are permitted under, and may be financed with proceeds of, the revolving credit facility, including increasing the aggregate purchase price for acquisitions consummated in any fiscal year from $1.0 million to $65.0 million during fiscal year 2022 and $50.0 million during any subsequent fiscal year, and adding an aggregate purchase price of $40.0 million for acquisitions consummated at any time during the term of the 2021 Credit Agreement related to businesses with a principal place of business located in the United Kingdom or the European Union.

Table of Contents
In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement provides that, assuming no event of default, restricted payments up to $25.0 million (increased from $10.0 million in the Prior Credit Agreement) in the aggregate and $10.0 million (increased from $3.0 million in the Prior Credit Agreement) in any single fiscal year may be used by us to repurchase our shares and pay dividends. The 2021 Credit Agreement modified the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with which we are required to comply. The 2021 Credit Agreement also reduced the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) floor from 1.0% to 0.25% and included a mechanism for adoption of a different benchmark rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. The 2021 Credit Agreement also reduced the fixed interest rate on our term loan in the amount of $15.0 million (the “2018 Term Loan”) was reduced from 4.15% to 3.90%.
The 2021 Credit Agreement superseded in its entirety, the Prior Credit Agreement. Amendment Two to the Prior Credit Agreement had previously extended the term of the revolving credit facility to October 20, 2022 and increased the revolving credit commitment to $40.0 million.
Amendment Two had modified the definition of the applicable rate used to determine interest charges on outstanding and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility and it amended the definition of permitted acquisitions to amend borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for acquisitions. In addition, Amendment Two had amended the definition of restricted payments to exclude amounts up to $2.5 million during each fiscal year used to pay certain employee tax obligations associated with share-based payment and stock option activity, and modified certain restrictions to our ability to repurchase our shares and pay dividends. Amendment Two also had modified the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with which we were required to comply and limited capital expenditures to $5.5 million for fiscal year 2021. Amendment Two also had established a LIBOR floor of 1.0% and included a mechanism for adoption of a different benchmark rate in the event LIBOR was discontinued.
As of December 24, 2022, $80.0 million was available under the revolving credit facility, of which $42.2 million was outstanding and included in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and 2022, we used $8.3 million and $20.9 million, respectively, for business acquisitions.
As of December 24, 2022, $7.0 million was outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan, of which $2.2 million was included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remainder included in long-term debt. The 2018 Term Loan requires total repayments (principal plus interest) of $0.2 million per month through December 2025.
Pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement, we were required to comply with a fixed charge ratio covenant and a leverage ratio covenant, which were modified by the 2021 Credit Agreement. The allowable leverage ratio under the Prior Credit Agreement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 was a maximum multiple of 4.0 of total debt outstanding compared to EBITDA and non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Prior Credit Agreement also had provided that the trailing twelve-month pro forma EBITDA of an acquired business was included in the allowable leverage calculation. After the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Credit Agreement, the allowable leverage ratio is a maximum multiple of 3.0. We were in compliance with all loan covenants and requirements during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement, was 1.66 at December 24, 2022, compared with 1.74 at March 26, 2022
Interest on the revolving credit facility continues to accrue, at our election, at either the variable one-month LIBOR or a fixed rate for a designated period at the LIBOR corresponding to such period (subject to a 1% floor during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and a 0.25% floor for subsequent periods), in each case, plus a margin. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Term Loan accrued at a fixed rate of 4.15% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and accrue at a fixed rate of 3.90% during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and over the term of the loan for subsequent periods. Unused fees accrue based on the average daily amount of unused credit available on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate margins and unused fees are determined on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio.

Operating Activities : Net cash provided by operations was $14.0 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to $12.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal year 2022. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by operations was primarily the result of changes in net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities). The significant working capital fluctuations were as follows:
●
Receivables: Accounts receivable decreased $2.0 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 inclusive of $0.7 million of accounts receivable acquired during the period. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, accounts receivable increased by a net amount of $0.8 million inclusive of $2.6 million of accounts receivable acquired during the period. The year-over-year variation reflects changes in the timing of collections. The following table illustrates our “days sales outstanding” as of December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

Inventory: Our inventory strategy includes making appropriate large quantity, high dollar purchases with key manufacturers for various reasons, including maximizing on-hand availability of key products, expanding the number of SKU’s stocked in anticipation of customer demand, reducing backorders for products with long lead times and optimizing vendor purchase and sales volume discounts. As a result, inventory levels may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of these large orders in relation to our quarter end. Our inventory balance increased $4.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. Our inventory balance increased by $2.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2022.
●
Accounts Payable: Changes in accounts payable may or may not correlate with changes in inventory balances at any given quarter end due to the timing of vendor payments for inventory, as well as the timing of payments for outsourced Service vendors and capital expenditures.
Accounts payable decreased $0.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 inclusive of $0.1 million of accounts payable acquired during the period.  Accounts payable increased $0.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2022. The variances are largely due to the timing of inventory and capital expenditures and other payments in the respective periods.
●
Accrued Compensation and Other Current Liabilities: Accrued compensation and other current liabilities include, among other things, amounts paid to employees for non-equity performance-based compensation. At the end of any particular period, the amounts accrued for such compensation may vary due to many factors including, but not limited to, changes in expected performance levels, the performance measurement period, and timing of payments to employees.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, accrued compensation and other current liabilities decreased by $2.4 million. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, accrued compensation and other current liabilities decreased by $1.1 million. The change from the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 was largely due to the annual payment of incentive based compensation accruals.
●
Income Taxes Payable: In any given period, net working capital may be affected by the timing and amount of income tax payments. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 the net income tax receivable decreased by $0.8 million. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, income taxes payable decreased by $0.4 million. The year-over-year difference is due to timing of income tax payments.

Investing Activities:
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we invested $7.1 million in capital expenditures that was used primarily for customer-driven expansion of Service segment capabilities and our rental business.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, we invested $5.9 million in capital expenditures that was used primarily for customer-driven expansion of Service segment capabilities and our rental business.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we used $8.3 million for business acquisitions. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, we used $20.9 million for business acquisitions.
During each of the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022, no contingent consideration or other holdback amounts were paid related to business acquisitions.
Financing Activities : During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, $2.3 million was borrowed from our revolving line of credit and $0.5 million in cash was generated from the issuance of common stock. In addition, we used $1.6 million for scheduled repayments of our term loan and $0.4 million for the “net” awarding of certain share awards to cover employee tax-withholding obligations for share award and stock option activity in fiscal year 2023, which are shown as a repurchase of shares of our common stock.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, $22.8 million was borrowed from our revolving line of credit and $1.4 million in cash was generated from the issuance of common stock. In addition, we used $1.6 million for scheduled repayments of our term loan and $5.6 million for the “net” awarding of certain share awards to cover employee tax-withholding obligations for share award and stock option activity in fiscal year 2022, which are shown as a repurchase of shares of our common stock.
OUTLOOK
We are pleased with the growth across all of our business channels including double-digit organic Service growth in our third quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our unique value proposition will continue to drive a sustainable competitive advantage in the highly regulated markets that we serve, particularly the Life Science and Aerospace and Defense markets.
We are confident our work around differentiation, including Nexa's service tracks and consulting platform, will foster continued organic revenue growth.  Driven by recurring revenue streams and regulation, we expect our Service segment to outperform through various economic cycles.
Our acquisition pipeline is very active. Acquisitions, which have generated compelling returns throughout fiscal year 2023, will continue to be an important component of Service growth. In addition, in both the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, we expect organic Service revenue growth to remain in the high-single digit range. We also expect gross margin improvement to continue in those periods as a by-product of both growth and successful execution of various ongoing productivity enhancement programs.
We expect our income tax rate to range between 21% and 23% for full fiscal year 2023. This estimate includes Federal, various state, Canadian and Irish income taxes and reflects the discrete tax accounting associated with share-based payment awards.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
INTEREST RATES
Our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowing activities. In the event interest rates were to move by 1%, our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $0.4 million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant. As of December 24, 2022, $80.0 million was available under our revolving credit facility, of which $42.2 million was outstanding and included in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As described above under “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we also have a $15.0 million (original principal) term loan. The 2018 Term Loan is considered a fixed interest rate loan. As of December 24, 2022, $7.0 million was outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan and was included in long-term debt and current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2018 Term Loan requires total (principal and interest) repayments of $0.2 million per month.

At our option, we borrow from our revolving credit facility at the variable one-month LIBOR or at a fixed rate for a designated period at the LIBOR corresponding to such period (subject to a 1% floor during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and a 0.25% floor for subsequent periods), in each case, plus a margin. Our interest rate margin is determined on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio. Our interest rate during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 for our revolving credit facility ranged from 1.6% to 6.0%. Interest on outstanding borrowings of the 2018 Term Loan accrued at a fixed rate of 4.15% over the term of the loan during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and 3.90% over the term of the loan for subsequent periods. Our revolving credit facility includes a mechanism for adoption of a different benchmark rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. On December 24, 2022, we had no hedging arrangements in place for our revolving credit facility to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Approximately 90% of our total revenues for each of the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and 2022 were denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder denominated in Canadian dollars and Euros. A 10% change in the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar and the Euro to the U.S. dollar would impact our revenue by approximately 1%. We monitor the relationship between U.S. and Canadian currencies and the U.S. dollar and the Euro on a monthly basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in Canadian dollars or Euros as we believe to be appropriate.
We continually utilize short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that future earnings denominated in Canadian dollars would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. We do not apply hedge accounting and therefore the net change in the fair value of the contracts, which totaled a gain of $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million during the first nine months of each of the fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, was recognized as a component of Interest and Other Expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying accounts receivables denominated in Canadian dollars being hedged. On December 24, 2022, we had a foreign exchange contract, which matured in January 2023, outstanding in the notional amount of $3.0 million. The foreign exchange contract was renewed in January 2023 and continues to be in place. We do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report (our third quarter of fiscal year 2023) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
