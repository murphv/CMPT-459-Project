Table of Contents MULLEN AUTOMOTIVE INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) ​ NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Description of Business Mullen Automotive Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MAI”, “Mullen”, “we” or the “Company”), is a Southern California-based development-stage electric vehicle company that operates in various verticals of businesses focused within the automotive industry. Mullen Automotive Inc., a California corporation (“Previous Mullen”) was originally formed on April 20 2010, as a developer and manufacturer of electric vehicle technology and operated as the EV division of Mullen Technologies, Inc. (“MTI”) until November 5, 2021, at which time Previous Mullen underwent a capitalization and corporate reorganization by way of a spin-off to its shareholders, followed by a reverse merger with and into Net Element, Inc., which was accounted for as a reverse merger transaction, in which Previous Mullen was treated as the acquirer for financial accounting purposes. (the “Merger”).  The Company changed its name from “Net Element, Inc.” to “Mullen Automotive Inc” and the Nasdaq ticker symbol for the Company’s Common Stock changed from “NETE” to “MULN” on the Nasdaq Capital Market Exchange at the opening of trading on November 5, 2021.
Recent Events On September 7, 2022, the Company completed the Bollinger acquisition,  which provides the Company with  a medium duty truck classes 4-6, along with the B1 Sport Utility and B2 Pick Up Trucks.  The purchase price was
$ 148.6
million in cash and stock for
60 %
majority controlling interest. On October 13, 2022, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the Company acquisition  of assets from electric vehicle company ELMS’ (Electric Last Mile Solutions) in an all-cash purchase. In the Chapter 7 approved transaction, Mullen acquired ELMS’ manufacturing plant in Mishawaka Indiana, all inventory, and intellectual property for their Class 1 and Class 3 vehicles for a total of
$ 105
million which includes the affirmation of approximately
$ 10
million in vendor payables assumed and paid at closing.
On November 9, 2022, the Company formed Mullen Indiana Real Estate LLC, a limited liability company in the State of Delaware to hold the acquired real property located in Mishawaka, IN. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission for the year ended September 30, 2022 .
The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other periods. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Mullen Investment Properties LLC, a Mississippi corporation, Ottava Automotive, Inc., a California corporation, Mullen Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware corporation and Bollinger Motors Inc., a Delaware corporation. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated, if any. The financial statements reflect the consolidated financial position and results of operations of Mullen, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

Table of Contents NOTE 2 – LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. Our principal source of liquidity consists of existing cash and restricted cash of approximately $ 107.4
million at December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company used $ 33.2
million of cash for operating activities and had net working capital deficit of approximately $ 261.9
million at December 31, 2022. Going Concern The Company’s financial statements as of December 31, 2022, have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has not generated revenue to date and has accumulated losses since inception. The Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, its ability to raise sufficient additional capital and/or obtaining the necessary financing to support ongoing and future operations and to successfully manufacture and launch its products for sale. While the Company expects to obtain the additional capital and/or financing that is needed, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary funds to bring its product and service offerings to market and support future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our management plans to raise additional capital through a combination of equity and debt financing, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Company management has evaluated whether there are any conditions and events considered in aggregate, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the date of filing this report. Since inception, the Company incurred significant accumulated losses of approximately $ 1,266.2  million, and has a deficiency in working capital of approximately $ 261.9
million on December 31, 2022. For more information regarding additional financing after December 31, 2022, see Note 19 – Subsequent Events. NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Significant accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Business Combination ​ Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense. The Company completed the acquisition of Bollinger Motors, Inc on September 7, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the carve-out financial statements and the reported amounts of total expenses in the reporting periods. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, fair value of long-lived assets, fair value of financial instruments, depreciable lives of property and equipment, income taxes, contingencies, and inputs used to value stock-based compensation, valuation of common and preferred stock and warrants. Additionally, the rates of interest on several debt agreements have been imputed where there was no stated interest rate within the original agreement. The imputed interest results in adjustments to the debt amounts reported in our condensed
8
Table of Contents consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP. Loan valuations issues can arise when trying to determine the debt attributes, such as discount rate, credit loss factors, liquidity discounts, and pricing. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for adjustments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Risks and Uncertainties The Company operates within an industry that is subject to rapid technological change, intense competition, and serves an industry that has significant government regulations. It is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including competitive, financial, developmental, operational, technological, required knowledge of industry governmental regulations, and other risks associated with an emerging business. Any one or combination of these or other risks could have a substantial influence on our future operations and prospects for commercial success. Cash and Cash Equivalents Company management considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were
no
cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. Restricted Cash Funds that are not available for immediate use and must use for a specific purpose. These funds include the refundable deposits for individuals and businesses who have made deposits for Mullen and Bollinger vehicles and the cash in escrow. On December 31, 2022, the restricted cash balance was $ 39,357,576 . Customer deposits are accounted for within other liabilities. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses consist of various advance payments made for goods or services to be received in the future. These prepaid expenses include insurance and other contracted services requiring up-front payments. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful lives of related assets are expensed as incurred. Estimated Useful Lives ​ Description      Life Buildings ​ 30 Years Furniture and Equipment ​ 3
to
7 Years Computer and Software ​ 1  to
5 Years
Machinery and Equipment ​ 3
to
7 Years Leasehold Improvements ​ Shorter of the estimated useful life or the underlying lease term Vehicles ​ 5 Years Intangibles ​ 5
to
10 Years ​ Expenditures for major improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the asset lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Company management continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying balances of its property,
9
Table of Contents equipment and leasehold improvements may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360,
“Property, Plant, and Equipment.”
When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Income Taxes Prior to Mullen’s capitalization and corporate reorganization, our operations were included in the tax filings of MTI. The cash and deferred tax positions between us and MTI and are formalized in a tax sharing agreement. Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740 , Income Taxes , which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there were no material changes to either the nature or the amounts of the uncertain tax positions. The Company’s income tax provision consists of an estimate for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in the tax law. We maintain a full valuation allowance against the value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because management does not believe the recoverability of the tax assets meets the “more likely than not” likelihood at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of acquired and developed intellectual property and website development costs. In accordance with ASC 350,
“Intangibles—Goodwill and Others,”
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Intangible assets with determinate lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Amortizable intangible assets generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to
120 months . The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. If such events or changes in circumstances arise, the Company compares the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets. If the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge, calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, is recorded. The fair value of the long-lived assets is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets. The Company has not recorded any such impairment charges during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 10
Table of Contents Other Assets Other assets are comprised primarily of Coda electric vehicles and related parts, Show Room vehicles, and security deposits related to the Company’s property leases related to the EV business. Extinguishment of Liabilities The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expired. Leases The Company follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Update, “Leases” (ASU 2016 02), which requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset for the lease term.
Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses are expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid and are classified within current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses include all non-production related expenses incurred by us in any given period. This includes expenses such as professional fees, salaries, rent, repairs and maintenance, utilities and office expense, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization, advertising and marketing, settlements and penalties, taxes, and licenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in G&A expenses. Other than trade show expenses which are deferred until occurrence of the future event, we expense advertising costs as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35,
“Other Expenses – Advertising Cost.” Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development of our electric vehicle product lines. Share-Based Compensation We account for share-based awards issued by the Company in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10, “Compensation – Share Compensation”, which requires fair value measurement on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense for all common shares of the Company issued to employees, non-employees and directors. The fair value of non-marketable share-based awards has been estimated based on an independent valuation. The Company’s common and preferred share valuations have been appraised by an independent financial valuation advisor, based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable. Key assumptions and approaches to value used in estimating fair value, includes economic and industry data; business valuation; prior transactions; option value method and other cost, income, and market value approaches. Share-based compensation is included within general and administrative expenses. Related Party Transactions We have related party transactions with certain of our directors, officers, and principal stockholders. These transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of business and include operational loans, convertible debt, and warrants providing financial support associated with the borrowing of funds. 11
Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, Company management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 –
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 –
Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 –
Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Concentrations of Business and Credit Risk We maintain cash balances in several financial institutions that are insured by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Association up to certain federal limitations, generally $250,000. At times, our cash balance may exceed these federal limitations and maintains significant cash on hand at certain of its locations. However, we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on these accounts. The amounts in excess of insured limits as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are $ 67.3
million and $ 53.3
million, respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Accounting standard updates issued but not yet added were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 4 – PURCHASE OF ASSETS FROM ELMS On October 13, 2022, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware issued an order approving the sale for approximately $ 105
million to Mullen Automotive Inc. of certain assets and assumption and assignment of contracts and related liabilities of Electric Last Mile, Inc. and Electric Last Mile Solutions, Inc. pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated September 16, 2022.
The ELMS asset acquisition closed on November 30, 2022, and is expected to accelerate the market introduction of our cargo van program and provide us with critical manufacturing capacity at a much lower investment than previously expected to supply the rest of our product portfolio. ELMS assets include: ● The factory in Mishawaka, Indiana, providing Mullen with the capability to produce up to
50,000
vehicles per year; ● All Intellectual Property, including all manufacturing data that is required for the assembly of the Class 1 van and Class 3 Cab Chassis; 12
Table of Contents ● All inventory including finished and unfinished vehicles, part modules, component parts, raw materials, and tooling; and ● All property including equipment, machinery, supplies, computer hardware, software, communication equipment, data networks and all other data storage. The following details the allocation of purchase price by asset category for the ELMS asset purchase: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Asset Category ​ Fair Value Allocation Land ​ $

and $ 5,361 , respectively. The $ 22.2
million is mainly due to the ELMS asset acquisition (see NOTE 4 – Purchase of Assets from ELMS). The weighted average useful life of the intellectual property is
9.6  years. Acquired intellectual property from the Bollinger acquisition, consisted primarily of patents and non-compete agreements have finite life. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and the estimated useful lives of
three years . The straight-line method of amortization represents management’s best estimate of the distribution of the economic value of the identifiable intangible assets. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      September 30, 2022 ​   Gross   ​ ​   Net   Gross   ​ ​   Net ​   Carrying      Accumulated

and $ 3,247,185
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In some instances, we issued shares of common stock or warrants along with the issuance of promissory notes, resulting in the recognition of a debt discount which is amortized to interest expense over the term of the promissory note. Debt discount amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 150,151,130
and $ 19,212,176 , respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, warrants having a fair value of $ 244,510,164
(issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes) were recognized as a derivative liability, which exceeded the face value of the underlying debt, resulting in additional interest expense of $ 94,510,164 . 14
Table of Contents The Company issued shares of common stock to certain creditors for the conversion of convertible notes, satisfaction of debt payments, and in settlement of indebtedness.

8.99 % per annum and the principal amount is due March 1, 2024. Collateral for the loan includes the title to the Company’s property at 1 Greentech Drive, Tunica, MS. Under the Promissory Note, prepaid interest and issuance costs of $ 1,157,209
were withheld from the principal and recorded as debt discount, which is being amortized over the term of the note. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized debt discount was $ 716,535 . Drawbridge and Amended A&R Note with Esousa On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Secured Convertible Note and Security Agreement (the “A&R Note”) with Esousa Holdings LLC, a New York limited liability company (“Esousa”). The A&R Note amended and restated a promissory note dated July 23, 2020, issued by Mullen Technologies, Inc. (“Original Borrower”) to DBI Lease Buyback Servicing LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“DBI”) for a principal amount of $ 23,831,554
(the “Original Note”). The Company had previously assumed all of the obligations of the Original Borrower under the Original Note upon the completion of the Merger. Esousa purchased rights under the Original Note from DBI immediately prior to entering into the A&R Note.
The A&R Note extended the maturity date of the Original Note by
two years , from July 23, 2022 to July 23, 2024. The A&R Note provided Esousa the right to convert all or any portion of the then-outstanding principal balance of the A&R Note into a calculated number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with Drawbridge and the related expense within the “Incentive fee to creditor for transfer of note payable” line item of the Statement of Operations.   In connection with entering into the A&R Note with Esousa, the Company agreed to provide Drawbridge with a right to purchase up to $ 25,000,000
worth of shares of a yet to be created Series E Preferred Stock from the Company (the “Series E Purchase Option”). Refer to Note 17 – Contingencies and Claims, for details on the Series E Purchase Option. On June 27, 2022, the Company received notification from Esousa that it was exercising the A&R Note’s conversion feature to partially convert the A&R Note and accrued interest in exchange for
28,000,000
shares of common stock. The conversion price was $ 0.9918
per share. Due to the limited number of authorized shares available, only
17,500,000
shares of common stock were issued, resulting in a remaining principal balance of the A&R Note of $ 1,096,787 . The remaining
10,500,000
shares owed to Esousa were recognized as a “Liability to issue shares” on the Balance Sheet. The Company agreed to pay a $ 3,495,000
penalty to Esousa, settleable in cash or shares of common stock, by August 31, 2022. This fee was recognized as penalty for insufficient authorized shares within the Statement of Operations and within Accrued Expenses on the Balance Sheet. On October 14, 2022, the A&R Note with Esousa, including principal of $ 1,032,217
(net of debt discount of $ 64,570 ) and accrued interest of $ 316,127
along with the liability to issue
10,500,000
shares of common stock (having a then carrying value of $ 10,710,000 ) and an obligation to compensate for the losses from market value decline of shares were exchanged for a new convertible note payable with a face value of $ 12,945,914
and
23,000,000
shares of common stock (having a fair value of $ 5,524,600 ), resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $ 6,412,170 .  The new note is convertible at a
5 % discount to the lowest daily volume-weighted average price in the
10
trading days prior to conversion, which resulted in interest expense of $ 681,364
and debt premium of $ 681,364 . 15
Table of Contents On November 1, 2022, the convertible note payable to Esousa, having a face value of
$ 12,945,914
(plus debt premium of
$ 681,364 ) and accrued interest of
$ 171,174
was converted into
62,048,066
shares of common stock.  No gain or loss was recognized upon the conversion. Convertible Notes
On November 14, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the June 7, 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). The investors paid $ 150  million and in lieu of receiving shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants, the investors received notes convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Notes”) and Warrants.
Amendment No. 3 further provides that the remaining $ 90  million of the Commitment Amount will be paid in  two  tranches, on January 24, 2023, and February 24, 2023, (each, a “Purchase Date”). The purchase price per share of Series D Preferred Stock will be the lower of (i) $ 1.27 , the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date the Securities Purchase Agreement was executed, or (ii) the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the respective Purchase Date, subject to a floor price of $ 0.10  per share. For  no  additional consideration, for every share of Series D Preferred Stock purchased, such investor will receive Warrants to purchase common shares equal to
185 % of the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock purchased by the investors at an exercise price equal to the purchase price for shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The Warrants will also permit cashless exercise to be calculated as a function of the warrant’s Black-Scholes value.  Consummation of the transaction is dependent on certain conditions precedent.  The investors have the right to delay each Purchase Date by one day for every day that the Company is unable to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. On November 15, 2022, the Company issued unsecured convertible notes aggregating $ 150,000,000
in lieu of Preferred Stock. The unsecured convertible notes bear interest at
15 % and are convertible into shares of common stock either: (A) at the option of the noteholder at the lower of: (i) $ 0.303 ; or (ii) the closing price of our common stock on January 3, 2023; or (B) mandatorily on November 21, 2022 at the lower of: (i) $ 0.303 ; or (ii) the closing price of our common stock on November 18, 2022, provided adequate unissued authorized shares were available.  For each share issued upon conversion, the holders are entitled to
1.85
times as many
five-year
warrants with an exercise price equal to the conversion price for the notes.   As a result, and since the Company had an insufficient number of authorized shares available to settle potential future warrant exercises, the Company recognized a derivative liability of $ 244,510,164
for the warrants with a corresponding increase in debt discount of $ 150,000,000
and interest expense of $ 94,510,164 .  The debt discount was amortized over the term of the note through the date the convertible notes were mandatorily convertible.  Accordingly, the entire $ 150,000,000
of debt discount was expensed to interest expense during the three month period ended December 31, 2022. On November 21, 2022, principal of $ 59,402,877
was mandatorily converted into
220,828,539
shares of common stock, resulting in a corresponding reduction in derivatives liabilities of $ 10,491,265
and a gain on conversion of $ 9,965,728 .  On December 23, 2022, the Company defaulted on the notes by not having sufficient authorized shares to allow for both the notes to be fully converted and the warrants to be exercised (See Note 19 – Subsequent Events). As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, accrued interest on outstanding notes payable was $ 3,019,085
and $ 1,374,925 , respectively. ​ NOTE 7 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ​ Upon the issuance of certain convertible debentures, warrants, and preferred stock, the Company determined that the features associated with the conversion option embedded in the debentures should be accounted for as a derivative liability and measured at fair value, as a derivative liability, as the Company has insufficient number of authorized shares available to settle all potential future conversion transactions. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, upon issuance of the instruments underlying the derivative liabilities and upon revaluation (immediately prior to conversion of the underlying instrument), the Company estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend
16
Table of Contents yield of
0 % , (2) expected volatility of
135 %
to
151 % , (3) risk-free interest rate of
3.77 %
to
3.97 % , and (4) expected life of
0.02
to
10
years. On December 31, 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives of $ 261,480,084
using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of
0 %, (2) expected volatility of
135 % -
151 %, (3) risk-free interest rate of
3.88 % to
4.12 %, and (4) expected life of
0.08
to
10
years. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 825-10. ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: ● Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ● Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. ● Level 3 – Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. All items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon Level 3 inputs. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Non-financial assets, such as property, equipment and leasehold improvements are only required to be measured at fair value when acquired or when an impairment loss is recognized. See
“ Note 13 - Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net ”
for further information on impairment of fixed assets . Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
As of November 15, 2022, the Company had an insufficient number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance upon conversion of convertible preferred shares and convertible notes payable and the exercise of outstanding warrants.  These financial instruments meet the definition of a derivative until stockholders approve an increase in the authorized shares of common stock. The financial instruments convertible into shares of common stock are valued using
17
Table of Contents the Black Scholes option valuation model. Items recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the following items as of December 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ Quoted Prices  ​ Significant  ​ Significant  ​ ​ ​ 2022 ​ in Active  ​ Other  ​ Unobservable  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Markets for  ​ Observable  ​ Inputs  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Identical Assets ​ Inputs  ​ (Level 3) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Level 1) ​ (Level 2) ​ ​ Derivative liability ​ $ 261,480,084 ​ $         - ​ $                - ​ $ 261,480,084 ​ A summary of the changes in derivative liability is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance, September 30, 2022 $
- Transfers in due to issuance of warrants w/o having adequate authorized unissued shares available ​
244,510,164 Derivative liability authorized shares shortfall (P&L) ​

528,305 Transfers out due to conversions of convertible notes and accrued interest into common shares ​
( 10,491,265 ) Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 261,480,084 ​ Financial instruments Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and credit risk. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt. We believe that the carrying value of term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rates associated with these obligations. Accounts payable are short-term in nature and generally terms are due upon receipt or within 30 to 90 days. ​ NOTE 8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock On November 5, 2021, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which included the rights and privileges of Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Stock.  Under the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.

Table of Contents The Warrants provide that if the Company issues or sells, enters into a definitive, binding agreement pursuant to which he Company is required to issue or sell or is deemed, pursuant to the provisions of the Warrants, to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for a price per share lower than the exercise price then in effect, subject to certain limited exceptions, then the exercise price of the Warrants shall be reduced to such lower price per share. In addition, the exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment in connection with stock splits, dividends or distributions or other similar transactions.

0.303 ​ ​ NOTE 9 – LOSS PER SHARE Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common stockholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the convertible debt and shares of Preferred Stock were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the “if-converted method.” The warrants to purchases shares of common stock also were excluded from the computation because the result would have been antidilutive.

Table of Contents Consulting agreements with shares for services have a cost determined by the number of shares granted within the individual contract multiplied by the market value of the shares provided on date of grant. The shares specified within the individual agreements are negotiated and approved by our Chief Executive Officer. The consultant typically earns share-based compensation over the service period which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period. The common shares provided for services are accounted for as professional fees within G&A expense and employee share issuances are part of compensation expense.

NOTE 16 – LEASES We have entered into various operating lease agreements for certain offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, and corporate aircraft. Operating leases are included in right-of-use assets, and current and noncurrent portion of lease liabilities, as appropriate. These right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred at lease commencement and exclude lease incentives. The lease terms may include
options to extend
or
terminate
the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements which require payments for both lease and non-lease components and have elected to account for these as a single lease component. Certain leases provide for annual increases to lease payment based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or at the lease commencement date for new leases.

5,077,650 ​ ​ ​ NOTE 17 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ASC 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies, including potential losses from litigation, regulation, tax and other matters. The accounting standard defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.” ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.” From time to time, we are subject to asserted and actual claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Company management reviews any such legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and it discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our consolidated financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, management evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Loop Global Inc. agreement On December 13, we entered into a definitive agreement with Loop Global Inc. to develop co-branded vehicle charging station infrastructure solutions. Series E Preferred Stock Purchase Option We entered into a letter agreement with DBI wherein we are committed to provide DBI with a right to purchase up to $ 25  million worth of a to-be-issued Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants. The option and its terms have not been finalized. Mullen Technologies, Inc. v. Qiantu Motor (Suzhou) Ltd. This claim was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (Case No. 3:19-cv-01979-W-DEB) on October 11, 2019. This matter arises out of a contract dispute between Mullen and Qiantu related to the engineering, design, support, and homologation of Qiantu’s K50 vehicle by Mullen. On July 1, 2020, the court ordered this matter to arbitration. It was submitted to the American Arbitration Association on February 9, 2021, for arbitration in Denver, Colorado. Mullen filed its Demand for Arbitration on February 16, 2021. Arbitration proceedings were then stayed for 90 days to accommodate settlement discussions. On November 3, 2021, Qiantu filed an Arbitration Answering Statement and Counterclaim or Joinder/Consolidation Request. Mullen filed its response on January 28, 2022. On February 11, 2022, the parties exchanged their Initial Requests for Documents.

27
Table of Contents reschedule the October 17, 2022, arbitration hearing to a future date while discovery and settlement negotiations continued. In November 2022, the parties agreed to further extend the Arbitration hearing date to February   2023. All associated pre-hearing dates were also extended. In early December, the parties reached an agreement in principle for resolution of the Arbitration proceedings which includes the acquisition of the Qiantu IP and the provision of a license to manufacture and sell the K-50 automobile in various territories. The parties are currently negotiating the terms of the proposed Settlement and License Agreement. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability from this claim, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. International Business Machines (“IBM”) This claim was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on May 7, 2019. This matter arises out of a contract dispute between Mullen and IBM related to a joint development and technology license agreement, patent license agreement, and a logo trademark agreement. On September 24, 2019, IBM filed a motion for summary judgment. By order dated April 21, 2022, the court granted IBM’s motion for summary judgment and ordered an inquest as to damages on IBM’s breach of contract claims. On November 9, 2021, the court, pursuant to an inquest order, awarded damages in favor of IBM and on December 1, 2021, the court entered a judgment in favor of IBM in the amount of $ 5,617,192 . Mullen filed a Notice of Appeal on December 2, 2021.
On February 2, 2022, IBM filed a Motion to Amend the Judgment it had obtained to add Mullen Automotive and Ottava as Judgment Debtors. Mullen filed its Appeal on April 8, 2022. Settlement efforts were undertaken, and a settlement was reached in which Mullen paid the full amount of the Judgment with interest, for a total of approximately $ 5.9
million, but maintained its Appeal rights. IBM then filed a Motion to Dismiss the Appeal based on Mullen’s payment of the Judgment. Mullen filed an Opposition to the same on July 18, 2022, and the hearing of the matter was set for July 25, 2022. The Court took the same under submission, and a decision has still not been issued. The Appeal is still pending. Federal and State Tax Liabilities During the third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into an instalment agreement with the IRS to pay $ 45,000

Upon the closing of any public offering, regardless of whether RJA procured the agreement regarding the offering, we are obligated to pay a financing fee of equal to the greater of a)
6.0 % of aggregate gross proceeds and b) $ 3,000,000 . The GEM Group On September 21, 2021, the GEM Group filed an arbitration demand and statement of claim against Mullen seeking declaratory relief and damages. This matter arises out of an alleged breached securities purchase agreement dated November 13, 2020.  Mullen filed its answering statement on October 21, 2021. On November 9, 2021, the parties appointed an Arbitrator.
GEM filed a dispositive motion on February 14, 2022. Mullen’s filed its opposition to the dispositive motion on March 3, 2022. On April 4, 2022, the Arbitrator denied GEM’s dispositive motion.

Table of Contents On November 8, 2022, the Court consolidated this matter and the Morsy Lawsuit (see below) into one case, and on November 30, 2022 stayed the consolidated derivative action pending (1) dismissal of the consolidated securities class action (the Schaub Lawsuit discussed above), or (2) the filing of an answer in the consolidated securities class action and notice by any party that they no longer consent to the voluntary stay of this consolidated derivative action.  The case currently remains stayed. Hany Morsy v. David Michery, et al.

Therefore, no liability has been reflected on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Thomas Robbins v. David Michery, et al. On December 7, 2022, Thomas Robbins, a purported stockholder, filed a stockholder class action complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, Mr. Michery, and current or former Company directors Mr. Novoa, Ms. Winter, Mr. Betor, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Miltner, Mr. Puckett, and Mr. New (the “Robbins Lawsuit”).  This lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under 8 Del.

C. §§ 225, 227, and 242 related to the vote on a series of proposal at a special meeting of Company stockholders that was held on December 23, 2022, and asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against all Company directors (except Mr. New).  The Foley Lawsuit also seeks an award of fees and costs related to this action. On January 5, 2023, the Court consolidated this action with the Robbins Lawsuit (discussed above), appointing lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. 30

Except as discussed below, management has determined that there were no subsequent events which required recognition, adjustment to or disclosure to the financial statements: Special Shareholder Meeting Results At the Special Meeting of Mullen Shareholders held on January 25, 2023, in order to meet NASDAQ listing requirements, a proposal for implementation of a reverse stock split was approved, which the company does not plan to enact in the event the stock eclipses the $ 1
mark between now and September 6th. Should the price of the Mullen common stock not reach $ 1
per share, management plans to implement the reverse split at a magnitude determined at that time. 31
Table of Contents Also at the Special meeting, shareholders approved the proposal to increase the Company’s authorized Common Share capital from
1.75
billion to
5
billion shares and a corresponding increase of
500,000
shares of the Company’s preferred stock. As a result, Mullen’s authorized capital stock increased from
2.25
billion shares to  5.5
billion shares. Series C Preferred Stock Dividend Waiver On January 13, 2023, the Company and holders of Series C Preferred Stock entered into a waiver agreement pursuant to which such holders irrevocably waived their right to receive any and all cumulative  15.0 % per annum fixed dividends on such Preferred Stock, including all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Settlement Agreement– Warrants Exercise and Share Issuance ​ On January 13, 2023, the Company entered into Settlement Agreements and Releases with Acuitas Capital LLC, Jim Fallon and Mank Capital (the “Holders”) pursuant to which the Holders agreed to remit to the Company an aggregate of approximately  $ 17.8
million (collectively, the “Settlement Payment”)  for  the erroneous issuance by the Company of an aggregate exercise of
1,660,988
warrants for approximately
79
million common shares of stock.
In consideration of the settlement, the Holders received the right to purchase (the “Settlement Additional Purchase Right”) additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock and warrants equal to
$ 20
million as provided under the Securities Purchase Agreement,  dated as of June 7, 2022 (as amended, the “Series D Securities Purchase Agreement”)  of units, consisting of one share of Preferred Stock and
185 %
Warrants for each share of Preferred Stock issued.   The Settlement Additional Purchase Right may be exercised by a Holder in accordance with the same terms that apply to Additional Purchases as described in the Series D Securities Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that if a Holder exercises its Settlement Additional Purchase Right, it shall receive Additional Warrants for shares of Common Stock in exchange for the issue of a promissory note  that will bear an annual interest rate of
3.5 % . Stock Subscription ​ On January 13, 2023, the Company entered into a promissory note with Acuitas Capital LLC (the “Borrower”) whereby Borrower unconditionally promises to pay the Company the principal amount of $ 17,721,868 , together with all accrued interest thereon, as provided in this Promissory Note.  For December 31, 2022, this amount is recorded as a stock subscription receivable. The promissory note bears an annual interest rate of
3.5 % and the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loan, all accrued and unpaid interest, and all other amounts payable under this Note shall be due and payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants issued pursuant to the Settlement Additional Purchase Right have been reserved for issuance and that the resale of such reserved shares of Common Stock have been registered on a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) February 1, 2024.  The Borrower may prepay at any time.   Settlement Agreement– Series D Securities Purchase Agreement ​ On January 13, 2023, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release in which investors waived the default prior to February 1, 2023, under the Series D Securities Purchase Agreement, and the Notes and the Warrants that were issued pursuant to Amendment No. 3. to the Series D Securities Purchase Agreement.  In exchange, the Company grants the investors the right to purchase additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock and warrants in an amount equal to such investor’s pro rata portion of $ 10
million.   Warrants issued pursuant to Settlement Agreements ​ Warrants issued pursuant to the Settlement Additional Purchase Right and the Second Additional Purchase Right will permit cashless exercise to be calculated as a function of the warrant’s Black-Scholes value.
32
Table of Contents The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants will further be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events and holders will be allowed to participate in certain issuances and distributions (subject to certain limitations and restrictions), including certain stock dividends and splits and distributions of assets. The warrants will provide for certain purchase rights whereby if the Company grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the holder will be entitled to acquire such purchase rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of the warrant. The Company would also agree not to enter into any fundamental, transaction, such as a merger, sale of more than  50 % of the outstanding voting shares, sale of substantially all assets, or business combination, unless the successor entity assumes all of the obligations of the Company under the Warrants and the other transaction documents related to the warrants. The Company must reserve out of authorized and unissued shares a number of shares of Common Stock equal to  250 % of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of the warrants from time to time. If the Company fails to timely deliver shares upon exercise of the Warrant, the Company will be required to either (A) pay the holder for each trading day on which shares are not delivered  1 % of the product of the number of shares not so issued multiplied by the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the required delivery date, or (B) if the holder purchases shares of Common Stock in anticipation of delivery of shares upon exercise of the Warrant, cash in an amount equal to holder’s total purchase price of such shares. The exercisability of the warrants may also be limited if, upon exercise, the holder and its affiliates would in aggregate beneficially own more than
9.99 % of the common stock. Utica Equipment Finance ​ During January 2023, the Company paid a $ 125,000
underwriting deposit to Utica Equipment Finance (“UEF”) for underwriting a lease commitment of up to $ 50,000,000 .  UEF will advance up to
75 % of the forced liquidation value of equipment provided to secure the lease.  The lease term is
48 months
with a lease factor of
2.934 % of the funding amount.  There is a
10 % fee on the funded amount at end of lease term as well as annual fees of $ 10,000
plus travel costs for annual equipment reinspection.  The underwriting deposit is refundable up to $ 100,000
or will otherwise be used to pay expenses associated with the lease.   Common Stock Issuances ​ During January, 2023, the Company issued
34,032,329
shares with a value of $ 9,561,561
which was primarily for CEO Equity Incentive. Between January 6, 2023, and February 8, 2023, the Company issued
19,513,727
shares for consulting services with a value of $ 7,412,744 . Partial Conversion of
$ 150
Million Note ​ On February 9, 2022, approximately $ 40
million of the $150 million note was converted for
132,013,202
shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase
244,224,424
shares of common stock. NOTE 20 - RESTATEMENT Prior to the initial issuance of the Company's financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, management determined that the warrants issued with the preferred stock did not meet the conditions for equity classification, requiring liability treatment and measured at fair value. In addition, management also discovered that it did not reflect the impact of amendments that resulted in modifications in privileges for the warrants issued with the Series C Preferred Stock, which should have been accounted for as a deemed dividend at the time of modification.   33

“ Report ” ) and with our audited financial statements and other information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the SEC for the year ended September 30, 2022. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the SEC for the year ended September 30, 2022. Basis of Presentation As a pre-revenue company with no commercial operations, our activities to date have been limited and were conducted primarily in the United States and our historical results are reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or "U.S.
GAAP") and in United States ("U.S.") dollars.
Components of Results of Operations We are an early-stage company, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results for reasons that may be difficult to anticipate. Accordingly, the drivers of our future financial results, as well as the components of such results, may not be comparable to our historical or projected results of operations. Revenues We have not begun commercial operations and do not currently generate any revenue. Once we commence production and commercialization of our vehicles, we expect that the majority of our revenue will be initially derived from direct sales of Commercial Delivery Vehicles (Class 1 – 6), Sport Utility Vehicles ("SUVs") and, subsequently, from flexible leases of our electric vehicles ("EVs"). Firm Order Agreement On December 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Firm Order Agreement (the “Order Agreement”) with Randy Marion Isuzu, LLC (“RMI”) pursuant to which RMI agreed during the period ending on December 31, 2023 (unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Order Agreement) to purchase a total of not less than 6,000 units of the initial production 6,800 units of the vehicles manufactured and produced by the Company. Contemporaneous with the execution of the Order
34
Table of Contents Agreement, RMI issued a purchase order for 1,000 vehicles and agreed to issue another purchase order on or before May 1, 2023, for no less than 1,000 vehicles. All additional purchase orders required to fulfill the order requirement are required to be issued no later than August 1, 2023. Products and vehicles with less than 500 miles that are not sold after 12 months can be returned to the Company at original pricing, subject to certain conditions. The Agreement may be terminated, among other reasons, if RMI ceases to be an authorized Mullen dealer or fails to function in the ordinary course of business or maintain its dealership facilities, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, RMI’s conduct adversely affects the Company, or an impairment of RMI’s reputation or financial standing. Cost of Goods Sold To date, we have not recorded cost of goods sold, as we have not recorded commercial revenue. Once we commence the commercial production and sale of our EVs, we expect cost of goods sold to include mainly vehicle components and parts, including batteries, direct labor costs, amortized tooling costs, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses include all non-production expenses incurred by us in any given period. This includes expenses such as professional fees, salaries, rent, repairs and maintenance, utilities and office expense, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization, advertising and marketing, settlements and penalties, taxes, licenses, and other expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in G&A expenses. We expense advertising costs as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, “ Other Expenses – Advertising Cost. ” Research and Development Expense To date, our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of external engineering services in connection with the design of our initial EV and development of the first prototype. As we ramp up for commercial operations, we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our hiring of engineers and designers and continues to invest in new vehicle model design and development of technology. Income Tax Expense / Benefit Our income tax provision consists of an estimate for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in the tax law. We maintain a valuation allowance against the full value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because we believe the recoverability of the tax assets is not more likely than not. 35

Net loss before accrued preferred dividends and noncontrolling interest was $378.5 million and $156.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   The $222.4 million or 143% increase in Net loss before accrued preferred dividends and noncontrolling interest was primarily due to a $162.8 million increase in non-cash financing expenses and $59.6 million increase in operating losses to ramp up of development efforts and reflecting the addition expenses from the purchase of Bollinger Motors and the purchase of ELMS assets.
General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $52.1 million or 404% to $65.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $12.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in professional services, marketing, and stock compensation related expenses associated with the growth of personnel and resources necessary to develop and launch our electric vehicles. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by $7.5 million or 645% to $8.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, versus $1.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses primarily consist of external engineering, homologation, and prototyping costs. These costs are expected to rise with continuing development of our electric vehicle programs.  There will also be incremental research and development costs associated with the recent acquisition of Bollinger Motors for the B1/B2 and Class 4 delivery chassis as well as research and development for the assets acquired in the ELMS asset purchase.   36
Table of Contents Other financing costs – initial recognition of derivative liabilities Other financing costs for the initial recognition of derivative liabilities increased $147 million from $109 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, to $256.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to recognition of derivative liabilities upon receipt of the $150 million convertible note.
Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net The loss on debt settlement increased $6.5 million from a gain of $74.5 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021, to a loss of $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a 2022 settlement with investors claiming losses caused by the Company (23,000,000 common shares issued) and the exchange of old note to Esousa for new replacement note to Esousa. Revaluation of derivative liabilities The revaluation of derivative liabilities increased $30.2 million from $10.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $40.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest expense Interest expense decreased by $0.4 million or 12% to $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in the convertible debt balance as well as from the paydown of debt principal during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Loan amortization expense Loan amortization expense decreased $19.2 million to zero for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $19.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Deferred tax benefit
Deferred tax benefit increased  $0.5 million to $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to zero for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to an adjustment in permanent timing differences for amortization expense.
Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net increased $0.7 million to $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $41 thousand of other expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Activity for the three months ended December 31, 2022 includes an $8.9 million financing loss from conversion of excess stock issued and a $10 million gain on conversion of convertible notes into common shares of the Company. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have yet to generate any revenue from our business operations. To date, we have funded our capital expenditure and working capital requirements through equity and debt capital, as further discussed below. Our ability to successfully commence commercial operations and expand our business will depend on many factors, including our working capital needs, the availability of equity or debt financing and, over time, our ability to generate cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) amounted to $68 million primarily due to $150 million from the issuance of convertible notes. 37
Table of Contents We expect our capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase substantially in the near term, as we seek to produce our initial EVs, develop our customer support and marketing infrastructure and expand our research and development efforts. We may need additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments, including unanticipated delays in negotiations with OEMs and tier-one automotive suppliers or other suppliers, supply chain challenges, disruptions due to COVID-19, competitive pressures, and regulatory developments, among other developments.  See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Debt To date, our current working capital and development needs have been primarily funded through the issuance of convertible indebtedness and Common Stock. Short-term debt comprises a significant component of our funding needs. Short-term debt is generally defined as debt with principal maturities of one-year or less. Long-term debt is defined as principal maturities of one year of more.  For further information on the Company’s debt, see Note 6 – Debt. Short and Long-Term Debt The short-term debt classification primarily is based upon loans due within twelve-months from the balance sheet date, in addition to loans that have matured and remain unpaid. Management plans to renegotiate matured loans with creditors for favorable terms, such as reduce interest rate, extend maturities, or both; however, there is no guarantee favorable terms will be reached. Until negotiations with creditors are resolved, these matured loans remain outstanding and will be classified within short-term debt on the balance sheet. Interest and fees on loans are being accounted for within accrued interest. The loans are secured by substantially all the Company’s assets. Several principal stockholders have provided loans to and hold convertible debt of the Company and are related parties. Cash Flows The following table provides a summary of Mullen’s cash flow data for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31,  ​ Net cash provided by (used in):      2022      2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating activities ​ $

150,000,000 ​
25,194,308 ​ ​ Cash Flows used in Operating Activities Our cash flow used in operating activities to date has been primarily comprised of costs related to research and development, payroll, and other general and administrative activities. As we continue to ramp up hiring ahead of starting commercial operations, we expect our cash used in operating activities to increase significantly before we start to generate any material cash flow from our business. Net cash used in operating activities was $33.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a 126% increase from $14.7 million net cash used in activities in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Cash Flows used in Investing Activities Our cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the ELMS asset purchase (see NOTE 4 – Purchase of assets from ELMS).
Net cash used in investing activities was $93.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase from $10.5 million used in investing activities in the three months ended December 31, 2021. 38
Table of Contents Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities Through December 31, 2022, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes equity securities, and warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities was $150 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $124.8 million over the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Management considers an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 39
Table of Contents Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Because we are a pre-revenue company without commercial operations, management believes it does not currently have any critical accounting policies or estimates. Management believes that the accounting policies most likely to become critical in the near future are those described below. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize the cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Our management reverses previously recognized costs for unvested options in the period that forfeitures occur. Mullen determines the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions: ● Expected Term —We use the simplified method when calculating the expected term due to insufficient historical exercise data. ● Expected Volatility —As our shares were not actively traded during the periods presented, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the automotive and energy storage industries. ● Expected Dividend Yield —The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on Common Stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. ● Risk-Free Interest Rate —The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting standard updates issued but not yet added were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that requires designing disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer each concluded, as of the end of the period, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and as described below. 40
Table of Contents Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed in our Annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. Under standards established by the PCAOB, a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  The material weaknesses in financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, are summarized as follows: ● We determined that we did not have sufficient accounting systems and procedures in place, particularly in the areas of specialized accounting for complex debt and equity transactions. ● We determined that we did not have sufficient policies and procedures to ensure the appropriate review and approval of user access rights to our accounting system; and lack of approval of journal entries and segregation of duties in our financial reporting process. ● We determined that our information technology infrastructure does not provide sufficient safeguards required by the COBIT framework. Remediation Efforts to Address Previously Identified Material Weaknesses  As previously described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, we began implementing remediation plans to address the material weaknesses. The weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that most of the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed by the end of fiscal 2023. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ 41
