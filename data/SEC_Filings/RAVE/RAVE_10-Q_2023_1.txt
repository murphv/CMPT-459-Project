RAVE RESTAURANT GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rave Restaurant Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “we,” “us” or “our”), franchises pizza buffet (“Buffet
Units”), delivery/carry-out (“Delco Units”) and express (“Express Units”) restaurants under the trademark “Pizza Inn” and franchises fast casual pizza restaurants (“Pie Five Units”) under the trademarks “Pie Five Pizza Company” or “Pie Five”.
The Company also licenses Pizza Inn Express, or PIE, kiosks (“PIE Units”) under the trademark “Pizza Inn”. We facilitate food, equipment and supply distribution to our domestic and international system of restaurants through agreements with
third party distributors. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to fairly present the
Company’s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for the fiscal periods presented are not necessarily indicative
of fiscal year-end results.
Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All appropriate
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Fiscal Quarters
The three and six month periods ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 each contained 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively.
Use of Management Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company’s
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect its reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other
various assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically. Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers and excludes incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties,
primarily sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.
The following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues:
Franchise Revenues
Franchise revenues consist of 1) franchise royalties, 2) supplier and distributor incentive revenues, 3) franchise license fees, 4) area
development exclusivity fees and foreign master license fees, 5) advertising funds, and 6) supplier convention funds.
Franchise royalties, which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur.
Supplier and distributor incentive revenues are recognized when title to the underlying commodities transfer.
Franchise license fees are typically billed upon execution of the franchise agreement and amortized over the term of the franchise agreement
which can range from
five
to
20
years. Fees received for renewal periods are amortized over the life of the renewal period.
7
Index
Area development exclusivity fees and foreign master license fees are typically billed upon execution of the area development and foreign
master license agreements. Area development exclusivity fees are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and allocated on a pro rata basis to all stores opened under that specific development
agreement. Area development exclusivity fees that include rights to sub-franchise are amortized as revenue over the term of the contract.
Advertising fund contributions for Pie Five and Pizza Inn units represent contributions collected where we have control over the activities
of the fund. Contributions are based on a percentage of net retail sales. We have determined that we are the principal in these arrangements, and advertising fund contributions and expenditures are, therefore, reported on a gross basis in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. In general, we expect such advertising fund contributions and expenditures to be largely offsetting and, therefore, do not expect a significant impact on our reported income before income taxes.
Our obligation related to these funds is to develop and conduct advertising activities.
Supplier convention funds are deferred until the obligations of the agreement are met and the event takes place.
Rental Income
The Company subleases some of its restaurant space to third parties. The Company’s
two
subleases have terms that end in 2023 and 2025. The sublease agreements are noncancelable through the end of the term and both parties have substantive rights to
terminate the lease when the term is complete. Sublease agreements are not capitalized and are recorded as rental income in the period that rent is received.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock options using the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance on share-based payments.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes formula to estimate the value of stock-based compensation for options granted to employees and directors and expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model in the future. The authoritative
guidance also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow.
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) represent the right to receive shares of common stock upon the satisfaction of vesting requirements,
performance criteria and other terms and conditions. Compensation cost for RSUs is measured as an amount equal to the fair value of the RSUs on the date of grant and is expensed over the vesting period if achievement of the performance
criteria is deemed probable, with the amount of the expense recognized based on the best estimate of the ultimate achievement level.
8
Index
Note B - Leases
The
Company determines if an
arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. To the extent that it can be determined that an arrangement represents a lease, it is classified as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company does not currently have
any finance leases. The Company capitalizes operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets through a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an
underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Short-term leases that have an initial term of one year or less are not capitalized. The Company
does not presently have any short-term leases.
Operating
lease right of use assets
and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of an arrangement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In addition to the present value of lease payments, the operating lease right of use asset also
includes any lease payments made to the lessor prior to lease commencement less any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Nature of Leases
The Company leases certain office space, restaurant space, and information technology equipment under non-cancelable leases to support its
operations. A more detailed description of significant lease types is included below.
Office Agreements
The Company rents office space from third parties for its corporate location. Office agreements are typically structured with non-cancelable
terms of
one
to
ten years .
The Company has concluded that its office agreements represent operating leases with a lease term that equals the primary non-cancelable contract term. Upon completion of the primary term, both parties have substantive rights to terminate the
lease. As a result, enforceable rights and obligations do not exist under the rental agreement subsequent to the primary term.
Restaurant Space Agreements
The Company rents restaurant space from third parties for its Company-owned restaurants. Restaurant space agreements are typically
structured with non-cancelable terms of
one
to
10 years . The Company has concluded that its restaurant agreements represent operating leases with a lease term that equals the primary non-cancelable contract term. Upon completion of
the primary term, both parties have substantive rights to terminate the lease. As a result, enforceable rights and obligations do not exist under the rental agreements subsequent to the primary term.
The Company subleases some of its restaurant space to third parties. The Company’s
two
subleases have terms that end in 2023 and 2025. The sublease agreements are noncancelable through the end of the term and both parties have substantive rights to terminate the
lease when the term is complete. Sublease agreements are not capitalized and are recorded as rental income in the period that rent is received.
As of
December 25,
2022 , the Company had
no
Company-owned
restaurants.
Information Technology Equipment
The Company rents information technology equipment, primarily printers and copiers, from a third party for its corporate office location.
Information technology equipment agreements are typically structured with non-cancelable terms of
one
to
five years . The Company has concluded that its information technology equipment commitments are operating leases.
Discount Rate
Leases typically do not provide an implicit interest rate. Accordingly, the Company is required to use its incremental borrowing rate in
determining the present value of lease payments based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that it would pay to borrow on a
collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company uses the implicit rate in the limited circumstances in which that rate is readily determinable.
Lease Guarantees
The Company has guaranteed the financial responsibilities of certain franchised store leases. These guaranteed leases are not considered
operating leases because the Company does not have the right to control the underlying asset. If the franchisee abandons the lease and fails to meet the lease’s financial obligations, the lessor may assign the lease to the Company for the
remainder of the term. If the Company does not expect to assign the abandoned lease to a new franchisee within 12 months, the lease will be considered an operating lease and a right of use asset and lease liability will be recognized.
9
Index
Practical Expedients and Accounting Policy Elections
Certain lease agreements include lease and non-lease components. For all existing asset classes with multiple component types, the Company
has utilized the practical expedient that exempts it from separating lease components from non-lease components. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components in an arrangement as a single lease component.
In addition, for all existing asset classes, the Company
has made an accounting policy election not to apply the lease recognition requirements to short-term leases (that is, leases that, at commencement, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the
underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise). Accordingly, we recognize lease payments related to short-term leases in our income statements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. To the extent that there
are variable lease payments, we recognize those payments in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

The Company’s
ability to purchase shares of our common stock is subject to various laws, regulations and policies as well as the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company may also purchase shares of our
common stock other than pursuant to the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan or other publicly announced plans or programs.
On December
21, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hallmark Financial Services, Inc. (“Hallmark”) pursuant to which the Company purchased from certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of Hallmark an aggregate of
2,246,086
shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $ 1.60
per share, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $ 3,593,738 .
The price per share represented the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the preceding
15
trading days. The transaction was approved by the Audit Committee of the Company, which consists of all of the independent directors of the Company. The Chairman of the Company, Mark E. Schwarz, who is also the Executive Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Hallmark, recused himself from all deliberations with respect to the Stock Purchase Agreement with Hallmark.

Note D - Commitments and Contingencies
On January 6,
2020, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Scott Crane, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging various claims in connection with the Company’s termination of his employment in July 2019.
In general, the suit asserted that the Company terminated Mr. Crane for the purpose of depriving him of certain equity compensation that would otherwise have become due to him on October 15, 2019. The case proceeded to a jury trial, which
resulted in a verdict in favor of Crane on his breach of contract claim. On February 9, 2022, the Court entered a $ 1.9
million
judgment against the Company inclusive of attorney fees, court costs and pre-judgment interest. The Company has filed an appeal of the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Company is subject to other various claims and contingencies related to employment agreements, franchise disputes, lawsuits, taxes,
food product purchase contracts and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Management believes that any such claims and actions currently pending are either covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s annual results of operations or financial condition if decided in a manner that is unfavorable to the Company.

The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable
income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization
of deferred tax assets.
Note H - Segment Reporting
The Company has
three
reportable operating segments as determined by management using the “management approach” as defined by ASC 280 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: (1) Pizza Inn Franchising, (2) Pie Five Franchising and
(3) Company-Owned Restaurants. These segments are a result of differences in the nature of the products and services sold. Corporate administration costs, which include, but are not limited to, general accounting, human resources, legal
and credit and collections, are partially allocated to the
three
operating segments. Other revenue consists of nonrecurring
items.
The Pizza Inn and Pie Five Franchising segments establish franchisees, licensees and territorial rights. Revenue for these segments are
derived from franchise royalties, franchise fees, sale of area development and foreign master license rights, incentive payments from third party suppliers and distributors, advertising funds, and supplier convention funds. Assets for
these segments include equipment, furniture and fixtures.
The Company-Owned Restaurants segment includes sales and operating results for all Company-owned restaurants. Assets for this segment
include equipment, furniture and fixtures for the Company-owned restaurants. As of December 25, 2022, the Company did not operate any Company-owned restaurants.
Corporate administration and other assets primarily include cash and short-term investments, as well as furniture and fixtures located
at the corporate office and trademarks and other intangible assets. All assets are located within the United States.

The domestic units were located in 18 states predominantly situated in the southern half of the United States. The international units
were located in seven foreign countries.
Basic net income per share decreased $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share for the three months ended December 25, 2022, compared to the
comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The Company had net income of $0.3 million for the three months ended December 25, 2022 compared to net income of $0.5 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year, on revenues of $2.9 million
for the three months ended December 25, 2022 compared to $2.7 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in franchise royalties, supplier and distributer incentives, and
advertising fund contributions. The $0.1 million decrease in net income for the three months ended December 25, 2022, compared to the comparable period of the prior year was primarily the result of a $0.1 million increase in income tax expense.
Basic net income per share of $0.04 per share was unchanged for the six months ended December 25, 2022, compared to the comparable
period in the prior fiscal year. The Company had net income of $0.7 million for the six months ended December 25, 2022 compared to net income of $0.7 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year, on revenues of $5.9 million for the six
months ended December 25, 2022 compared to $5.3 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in franchise royalties, supplier and distribution incentives, and advertising fund
contributions. The $0.1 million decrease in net income for the six months ended December 25, 2022 compared to the comparable period of the prior year was primarily the result of the $0.6 million increase in revenues partially offset by a $0.5 million
increase in expenses and a $0.2 million increase in income tax expense.

COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and the disease
spread rapidly throughout the United States and the world. Federal, state and local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our internal efforts to protect customers, franchisees, and employees, severely disrupted our business operations.
Further, the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated significant job losses and a national economic downturn that impacted the demand for restaurant food service.
Although most of our domestic restaurants continued to operate under these conditions, we have experienced temporary closures from
time to time during the pandemic. During much of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced dramatically reduced aggregate in-store retail sales at Buffet Units and Pie Five Units, modestly offset by increased aggregate carry-out and delivery sales. The
decreased aggregate retail sales correspondingly decreased supplier rebates and franchise royalties payable to the Company.
In most cases, in-store dining has now resumed subject to seating capacity limitations, social distancing protocols, and/or enhanced
cleaning and disinfecting practices. As a result, the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have diminished in recent periods. Nonetheless, an outbreak or perceived outbreak of COVID-19 connected to restaurant dining could cause negative publicity
directed at any of our brands and cause customers to avoid our restaurants. We cannot predict how long the pandemic will continue or whether it will recur, what additional restrictions may be enacted, if individuals will be comfortable frequenting
our Buffet Units and Pie Five Units, or to what extent off-premises will continue. Any of these changes could materially adversely affect the Company’s future financial performance.  However, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our future results of
operations and liquidity cannot presently be predicted.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
However, the Company also presents and discusses certain non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. Management may also use such non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the
effectiveness of business strategies and for planning and budgeting purposes. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative or substitute for the results reflected in the Company’s GAAP financial statements.
We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of operating performance that are commonly used by
securities analysts, investors and other parties interested in our industry. We believe that EBITDA is helpful to investors in evaluating our results of operations without the impact of expenses affected by financing methods, accounting methods and
the tax environment. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors by excluding non-operational or non-recurring expenses to provide a measure of operating performance that is more comparable from period to
period. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for evaluating operating performance, assessing the effectiveness of business strategies, projecting future capital needs, budgeting and other planning purposes.
The following key performance indicators presented herein, some of which represent non-GAAP financial measures, have these meanings
and are calculated as follows:
●
“EBITDA” represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
●
“Adjusted EBITDA” represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, severance, gain/loss on sale of assets,
costs related to impairment and other lease charges, franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense, and closed and non-operating store costs.
●
“Retail sales” represents the restaurant sales reported by our franchisees and Company-owned restaurants, which may be segmented by brand or domestic/international
locations.
●
“System-wide retail sales” represents combined retail sales for franchisee and Company-owned restaurants for a specified brand.
●
“Comparable store retail sales” includes the retail sales for restaurants that have been open for at least 18 months as of the end of the reporting period. The sales
results for a restaurant that was closed temporarily for remodeling or relocation within the same trade area are included in the calculation only for the days that the restaurant was open in both periods being compared.
●
“Store weeks” represent the total number of full weeks that specified restaurants were open during the period.
●
“Average units open” reflects the number of restaurants open during a reporting period weighted by the percentage of the weeks in a reporting period that each
restaurant was open.
●
“Average weekly sales” for a specified period is calculated as total retail sales (excluding partial weeks) divided by store weeks in the period.
●
“Non-operating store costs” represent gain or loss on asset disposal, store closure expenses, lease termination expenses and expenses related to abandoned store
sites.
●
“Franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense” represents the net of accelerated revenues and costs attributable to defaulted area development agreements and
closed franchised stores.

Pizza Inn total domestic retail sales increased by $2.6 million, or 12.5%, for the three months ended December 25, 2022 when compared
to the same period of the prior year. The increase in domestic retail sales was primarily the result of the diminished impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement. Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased by $1.7 million,
or 8.4%, for the same reason. For the six months ended December 25, 2022, the improvements in domestic retail sales and comparable store retail sales were primarily due to the diminished impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement.

Pie Five system-wide retail sales decreased $0.1 million, or 2.5%, for the three months ended December 25, 2022 when compared to the
same period of the prior year. Compared to the same fiscal quarter of the prior year, average units open in the period decreased from 34 to 31. Comparable store retail sales increased $0.3 million, or 6.3%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023
compared to the same period of the prior year. For the three months ended December 25, 2022, the decrease in domestic retail sales  were primarily the result of the decrease in store count offset by an increase in comparable store retail sales,
primarily resulting from the diminished impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement. For the six months ended December 25, 2022, the improvements in domestic retail sales and comparable store retail sales were primarily due to the diminished
impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement.

Index
Revenues:
Revenues are derived from franchise royalties, franchise fees and supplier and distributor incentives, advertising funds, area
development exclusivity fees and foreign master license fees, supplier convention funds, sublease rental income, interest and other income, and sales by Company-owned restaurants. The volume of supplier incentive revenues is dependent on the level of
chain-wide retail sales, which are impacted by changes in comparable store sales and restaurant count, as well as the products sold to franchisees through third-party food distributors.
Total revenues for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 and for the same period in the prior fiscal year were $2.9 million
and $2.7 million, respectively. The increase in total revenues was driven by increases in Pizza Inn franchise and license fees.
Total revenues for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 and for the same period in the prior fiscal year were $5.9 million and
$5.2 million, respectively. The increase in total revenues was driven by increases in Pizza Inn franchise and license fees.
Pizza Inn Franchise and License
Pizza Inn franchise revenues increased to $2.4 million for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 from $2.2 million for to the
same period of the prior fiscal year. Pizza Inn franchise revenues increased to $4.8 million for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 from $4.2 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by
increases in supplier incentives, domestic royalties and advertising fund revenues.
Pie Five Franchise and License
Pie Five franchise revenues remained relatively stable at $0.5 million for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 as compared
to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Pie Five franchise revenues remained relatively stable at $1.0 million for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
General and Administrative Expenses
Total general and administrative expenses increased $0.1 million to $1.5 million for the three month period ended December 25, 2022
compared to $1.4 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Total general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million to $2.8 million for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to $2.6 million for the same period of
the prior fiscal year. The increases in total general and administrative expenses
during both the three and
six
month periods were primarily
the result of increased corporate expenses.
Franchise Expenses
Franchise expenses include general and administrative expenses directly related to the sale and continuing service of domestic and
international franchises. Total franchise expenses increased to $0.9 million for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to $0.8 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Total franchise expenses increased to $2.1 million
for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to $1.8 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was p rimarily due
to an increase in payroll
and related, advertising, and travel costs.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Other Lease Charges
Impairment of long-lived assets and other lease charges was zero for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to zero
for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Impairment of long-lived assets and other lease charges was $5 thousand for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to zero for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was
primarily due to impaired beverage equipment.
Bad Debt Expense
The Company monitors franchisee receivable balances and adjusts credit terms when necessary to minimize the Company’s exposure to high
risk accounts receivable. For the three month period ended December 25, 2022, bad debt expense was $5 thousand compared to bad debt expense of $3 thousand for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Bad debt expense for the six month period ended
December 25, 2022, increased $1 thousand to $9 thousand compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $23 thousand to zero for the three month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to the same fiscal period
of the prior year. Interest expense decreased $46 thousand to $1 thousand for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to the same fiscal period of the prior year. In both cases, the decrease was primarily the result of the payment of
all outstanding convertible notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
20
Index
Amortization and Depreciation Expense
Amortization and depreciation expense increased slightly for the three and six months ended December 25, 2022, compared to the same
periods of the prior year. In both cases, the increase was primarily the result of higher amortization of intangible assets.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the three and six months ended December 25, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $140 thousand and $232 thousand,
respectively. For the three and six months ended December 26, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $4 thousand and $7 thousand, respectively. For the six months ended December 25, 2022, the federal and state tax expense were $182
thousand and $50 thousand, respectively.
The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable
income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred
tax assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the six month period ended December 25, 2022, the Company's primary source of liquidity was proceeds from operating activities.
Cash flows from operating activities generally reflect net income
adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, changes in deferred taxes, share based compensation, and changes in working capital.
Cash provided by operating activities was $792 thousand for the six month
period ended December 25, 2022   compared to cash provided by operating activities of $14 thousand for the six month period ended December 26, 2021.
The primary driver of increased operating cash flow during the
six
month period ended
December 25, 2022
was increa sed collections of accounts receivable related to the employee retention credit.
Cash flows from investing activities reflect net proceeds from the sale of assets and capital expenditures for the purchase of Company
assets. Cash used in investing activities during the six month period ended December 25, 2022 was $77 thousand compared to cash provided by investing activities of $48 thousand for the six months ended December 25, 2022.
Cash flows used in financing activities generally reflect changes in the Company's stock and debt activity during the period. Net cash
used by financing activities was $5.0 million for the six month period ended December 25, 2022 compared to net cash used   by financing activities of $0.2
million for the six month period ended December 26, 2021. Net cash used by financing activities for the six months ended December 25, 2022 was primarily attributable to repurchases of the Company's stock.
Management believes the cash on hand combined with net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the next
12 months and beyond.
Convertible Notes
On March 3, 2017, the Company completed a registered shareholder rights offering of its 4% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022
(“Notes”). Shareholders exercised subscription rights to purchase all 30,000 of the Notes at the par value of $100 per Note, resulting in gross offering proceeds to the Company of $3.0 million.
The Notes bore interest at the rate of 4% per annum on the principal or par value of $100 per note, payable annually in arrears on
February 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2018. Interest was payable in cash or, at the Company’s discretion, in shares of Company common stock. The Notes were secured by a pledge of all outstanding equity securities of our two primary direct
operating subsidiaries. The Notes matured on February 15, 2022, at which time all principal and unpaid interest was paid in cash.
Therefore, as
of December 25, 2022 , there were no Notes outstanding.
Employee Retention Credit
On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the
“CAA”) was signed into law.  The CAA expanded eligibility for an employee retention credit for companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with fewer than five hundred employees and at least a twenty percent decline in gross receipts compared to
the same quarter in 2019, to encourage retention of employees.  This payroll tax credit was a refundable tax credit against certain federal employment taxes. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, the Company recorded $0.7 million of other income
for the employee retention credit,
$0.6 million of which was collected in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under
the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically. Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies require estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain, are susceptible to change, and therefore require subjective judgments. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods.
Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables generated from franchise royalties and supplier concessions. The Company records
an allowance for bad debts to allow for any amounts which may be unrecoverable based upon an analysis of the Company’s prior collection experience, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. Actual realization of accounts receivable could
differ materially from the Company’s estimates.
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may
not be fully recoverable. Impairment is evaluated based on the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets compared to their carrying value. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of an impaired
asset is reduced to its fair value, based on discounted estimated future cash flows.
Franchise revenue consists of income from license fees, royalties, area development and foreign master license agreements, advertising
fund revenues, supplier incentive and convention contribution revenues. Franchise fees, area development and foreign master license agreement fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the related contract agreement.
Royalties and advertising fund revenues, which are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales, are recognized as income as retail sales occur. Supplier incentive revenues are recognized as earned, typically as the underlying commodities are
shipped.
The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable
income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, using
a “more likely than not” standard. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, more weight is
given to evidence that can be objectively verified, including recent operating performance.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a
company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. ASC 740-10 requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of
tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.
The Company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies from legal matters based upon factors such as the current status of the cases
and consultations with external counsel and provides for the exposure by accruing an amount if it is judged to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the actual loss from a contingency differs from management’s estimate, operating results
could be adversely impacted.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not required for a smaller reporting company.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information it is required to disclose in the reports
filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing
similar functions, have evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. During the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
On January 6, 2020, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Scott Crane, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
alleging various claims in connection with the Company’s termination of his employment in July 2019. In general, the suit asserted that the Company terminated Mr. Crane for the purpose of depriving him of certain equity compensation that would
otherwise have become due to him on October 15, 2019. The case proceeded to a jury trial, which resulted in a verdict in favor of Crane on his breach of contract claim. On February 9, 2022, the Court entered a $1.9 million judgment against the
Company inclusive of attorney fees, court costs and pre-judgment interest. The Company has filed an appeal of the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Company is subject to other claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that all such claims and actions
currently pending against it are either adequately covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s annual results of operations, cash flows or financial condition if decided in a manner that is unfavorable to the
Company.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Not required for a smaller reporting company.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On May 23, 2007, the Company’s board of directors approved a stock purchase plan (the “2007 Stock Purchase Plan”) authorizing the
purchase on our behalf of up to 1,016,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. On June 2, 2008, the Company’s board of directors amended the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
of common stock the Company may repurchase by 1,000,000 shares to a total of 2,016,000 shares. On April 22, 2009, the board of directors of the Company again amended the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan by increasing the aggregate number of shares of common
stock the Company may repurchase under the plan to a total of 3,016,000 shares. On June 28, 2022, the Company’s board of directors again amended the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock the Company may repurchase
by 5,000,000 shares to a total of 8,016,000 shares. During the six months ended December 25, 2022, the Company repurchased 3,356,977 outstanding shares of its common stock leaving 1,997,974 shares that may yet be repurchased under the 2007 Stock
Purchase Plan.
The Company’s ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to various laws, regulations and policies as well as the
rules and regulations of the SEC. Subsequent to December 25, 2022, the Company has not repurchased any outstanding shares but may make further repurchases under the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan. The Company may also repurchase shares of the Company's
common stock other than pursuant to the 2007 Stock Purchase Plan or other publicly announced plans or programs.
