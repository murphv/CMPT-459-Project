FLEXSTEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED) FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS – Flexsteel Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Flexsteel” or “Our”) is one of the largest manufacturers, importers, and marketers of furniture products in the United States. Product offerings include a wide variety of furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, reclining rocking chairs, swivel rockers, sofa beds, convertible bedding units, occasional tables, desks, dining tables and chairs, kitchen storage, bedroom furniture and outdoor furniture. A featured component in most of the upholstered furniture is a unique steel drop-in seat spring from which the name “Flexsteel” is derived. The Company distributes its products throughout the United States through its e-commerce channel and dealer sales force.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION – The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of such Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2023 . Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Except to the extent updated or described below, the significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
‎ Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of accounting policies.

4.  LEASES
The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”).
ASC 842 requires lessees to (i) recognize a right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and a lease liability that is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (ii) recognize a single lease cost, calculated over the lease term on a straight-line basis and (iii) classify lease-related cash payments within operating and financing activities.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to not recognize short-term leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and all non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, were excluded.
At any given time during the lease term, the lease liability represents the present value of the remaining lease payments, and the ROU asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for pre-paid rent, unamortized initial direct
7 Table of Contents
costs, and the remaining balance of lease incentives received. Both the lease ROU asset and liability are reduced to zero at the end of the lease term.
The Company leases distribution centers and warehouses, manufacturing facilities, showrooms, and office space. At the lease inception date, the Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains a lease. Some of the Company’s leases include options to renew at similar terms. The Company assesses these options to determine if the Company is reasonably certain of exercising these options based on relevant economic and financial factors. Options that meet these criteria are included in the lease term at the lease commencement date.
For purposes of measuring the Company’s ROU asset and lease liability, the discount rate utilized by the Company was based on the average interest rates effective for the Company’s line of credit. Some of the Company’s leases contain variable rent payments, including common area maintenance and utilities. Due to the variable nature of these costs, they are not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, Flexsteel entered into a lease agreement for a showroom in Las Vegas, Nevada. The
four -year lease term began on October 1, 2022, and ends on September 30, 2026.
On August 20, 2021, Flexsteel entered into a lease agreement for the construction of a
507,830
square foot manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The lease commencement date under ASC 842 guidance was on July 1, 2022, the date the lessor made the building available for use by the Company for purposes of completing any leasehold improvements required by the Company prior to beginning operations. The
12 -year lease term began on August 1, 2022, and ends on June 30, 2034, with
options for two five-year extensions . Annual base rent under the lease is $ 3.2
million plus taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs.

On May 15, 2019, the Company announced its plans to exit the Commercial Office and custom-designed Hospitality product lines . The changes were initial outcomes driven by customer and product line profitability and footprint utilization analyses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
On June 18, 2019, the Company announced it completed the analysis and planning process and set forth the comprehensive transformation program to be executed over a
two-year
period, which included the previously announced restructuring activities on May 15, 2019. The transformation program included activities such as business simplification, process improvement, exiting of non-core businesses, facility closures, and reductions in the workforce. The Company substantially completed the restructuring activities related to the exit of the Commercial Office and custom-designed Hospitality product lines during fiscal 2020.
On April 28, 2020, the Company announced the exit of Vehicle Seating, and the remainder of the Hospitality product lines, and subsequently closed its Dubuque, Iowa and Starkville, Mississippi manufacturing facilities. The Company substantially completed the restructuring activities related to the exit of Vehicle Seating and the remainder of the Hospitality product lines during fiscal 2021.
These actions are now complete, with one property remaining as held for sale as discussed in Note 3,
Assets Held for Sale . The Company incurred $ 59.4
million of expenses related to this restructuring program over the
two-year
timeframe ended June 30, 2022 and does not anticipate any further charges.

On March 22, 2021, the Company received notice of a class action lawsuit filed against Flexsteel Industries, Inc., and J.K. Dittmer and D.P. Schmidt as individuals, by a number of employees who had worked at the Dubuque Operations and Starkville plants prior to the closure of the locations due to the impact of COVID-19 on the business at that period of time.
The allegations with the claim include failure to pay employee benefits as required by an ERISA-governed severance plan, failure of J.K. Dittmer and D.P. Schmidt to act with respect to the ERISA-governed severance plan, and failure to provide 60-days’ notice or the equivalent amount of pay to the employees required by the WARN Act when the Company closed the Dubuque and Starkville locations. The parties participated in a lengthy mediation and on December 3, 2021, agreed to resolve the matter for $ 1.3
million. The matter was dismissed with prejudice on September 1, 2022.
The Company paid $ 1.3
million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 .
During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company paid all remaining costs associated with the restructuring program.

6.  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS
On August 28, 2020, the Company entered a
two-year
secured $ 25.0
million revolving line of credit with Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, with an interest rate of
1.50 % plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of
3.00 %. The revolving line of credit was secured by essentially all the Company’s assets, excluding real property, and required the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. This line of credit was subsequently canceled in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2022.
On September 8, 2021, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Lender”), and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement has a
five-year
term and provides for up to an $ 85
million revolving line of credit. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $ 5
million which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the revolving line of credit. The Company’s $ 1.1
million letters of credit previously issued by the Lender are being treated as outstanding under the Credit Agreement and reduce the amount of available borrowings under the revolving line of credit.
Proceeds of borrowings were used to refinance all indebtedness owed to Dubuque Bank & Trust and for working capital purposes. The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all its assets, excluding real property. Subject to certain conditions, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus
1.25 % or
1.50 % per annum, or an effective interest rate of
5.6 % on December 31, 2022. When LIBOR becomes unavailable, the replacement rate will be determined pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a financial covenant to maintain a fixed coverage ratio of not less than
1.00
to 1.00. In addition, the Loan Agreement places restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.
On April 18, 2022, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a first amendment to the September 8, 2021, Credit Agreement (“First Amendment to the Credit Agreement”), with the Lender and the lenders thereto.
The amendment to the Credit Agreement changed the definition of the term ‘Payment Conditions’ and further defines “default” or “event of default” and the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 19.2
million outstanding under the Credit Agreement, exclusive of fees and letters of credit.
Letters of credit outstanding at the Lender as of December 31, 2022, totaled $ 1.1
million.    7.  INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for the interim periods is based on an estimate of the Company’s annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items. Management judgment is required in projecting ordinary income to estimate the Company’s annual effective tax rate.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the quarters ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was
17.2 % and
13.8 %, respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was
11.5 % and ( 3.4 %), respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of
21 % due to nondeductible stock compensation, state taxes, the impacts associated with uncertain tax positions, as well as impacts arising from the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with movements in certain deferred tax assets. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory tax rate of
21 % due to the tax benefit on the year-to-date loss not being recorded due to the Company’s valuation allowance position.

On December 14, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved the Flexsteel Industries, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (“2022 Plan”). The 2022 Plan is a long-term incentive plan pursuant to which awards may be granted to certain employees, independent contractors and directors of the Company, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares or other stock-based awards. No awards have been granted under the 2022 Plan as of December 31, 2022.
The 2022 Plan replaces the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (“LTIP”) and the 2013 Omnibus Stock Plan (collectively, the “Prior Plans”) and no further awards will be made under either of the Prior Plans, but these Prior Plans will continue to govern awards previously granted under them.
(1)   Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
The LTIP provides for performance stock units (“PSUs”) to be awarded to officers and key employees based on performance goals set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”).
For awards under the LTIP for the three years ending June 30, 2023, 2024, and 2025, participants may earn
one-third
of the award in each of the
three years
based on meeting performance goals for that year. T he Committee selected Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Tax based on a defined percentage growth in fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025 as the performance metric. In conjunction with each grant of PSUs, the Committee grants RSUs under the 2013 Omnibus Stock Plan that vest at the end of
three years .
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the number of unvested PSUs granted at the target performance level for the 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 performance periods under the LTIP and the number of unvested RSUs granted in conjunction with the PSUs:

9.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) of common stock are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock include the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding.
The Company’s potential common shares outstanding are stock options, shares associated with the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, and non-vested restricted stock units and restricted shares. The Company calculates the dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock units, and restricted shares using the treasury stock method.
Anti-dilutive options are not included in the computation of diluted EPS when their exercise price is greater than the average closing market price of the common shares.

10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
– In March 2016, the Company received a General Notice Letter for the Lane Street Groundwater Superfund Site (the “Lane Street Site”) located in Elkhart, Indiana from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In April 2016, the EPA issued their proposed clean-up plan for groundwater pollution and request for public comment. The Company responded to the request for public comment in May 2016. The EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting a remedy in August 2016 and estimated total costs to remediate of $ 3.6  million. In July 2017, the EPA issued a Special Notice Letter to the Company demanding that the Company perform the remedy selected and pay for the remediation cost and past response costs of $ 5.5  million.
In April 2018, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for Remedial Design and Remedial Action (the “Order”) against the Company.  The Order was issued under Section 106(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. §9606(a).  The Order directs the Company to perform remedial design and remedial action for the Lane Street Site.  The Order was to be effective May 29, 2018.  To ensure completion of the remediation work, the EPA required the Company to secure financial assurance in the initial amount of $ 3.6  million, which as noted above, is the estimated cost of remedial work.  The Company believes that financial assurance is not required because it meets the relevant financial test criteria as provided in the Order. In May 2018, the EPA agreed to suspend enforcement of the Order so that the Company could conduct environmental testing upgradient to its former manufacturing location pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC). On April 24, 2019, the Company signed an AOC with the EPA to conduct the upgradient investigation.  The Company negotiated site access to the upgradient property over a period of months in 2019, followed by completion of sampling activities on that property on September 28-29, 2019.  Following multiple exchanges from November 2019 through early 2020, the Company submitted a final and supplemental report to the EPA regarding the results of the upgradient investigation on June 17, 2020.
Despite the Company’s position that it did not cause or contribute to the contamination, the Company reached a settlement with the EPA and the State of Indiana, which was filed as a consent decree in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on October 24, 2022.
The consent decree required Flexsteel to pay $ 9.8
million in resolution of the matter. Flexsteel also reached agreements with its insurance carriers for partial reimbursement of the settlement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has made full payment in accordance with the settlement agreement and as a result of insurance proceeds received, the Company recorded income of $ 2.8
million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, included in environmental remediation on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Other Proceedings
– From time to time, the Company is subject to various other legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of the Company’s business. The Company does not consider any of such other proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to its business or likely to result in a material effect on its consolidated operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.

Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021
Net sales were $93.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net sales of $141.7 million in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 34.3%. The decrease in sales of $48.5 million was primarily driven by a decrease of $42.1 million related to home furnishing products sold through retailers and a decrease of $6.4 million for home furnishing products sold through e-commerce channels, compared to the prior year quarter. Home furnishing sales have reverted to be in-line with pre-pandemic volumes as prior year quarter sales were especially strong due to the surge in COVID-induced spending on home furniture.
Retail home furnishings backlog was $60 million as of the quarter ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 50.4% as compared to $121 million home furnishings backlog in the prior year quarter mainly due to focus of the organization to reduce backlog down to 3-5 week lead times and softness of consumer demand in the quarter.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, was 17.0%, compared to 6.7% for the prior year quarter, an increase of 1,030 basis points (“bps”). The 1,030-bps increase was primarily due to a decline in ancillary charges, partially offset by the decline in sales volume in the quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased
$2.7 million or 15.3% to $14.9 million in the second quarter ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $17.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume related expenses of $1.3 million and a decrease in all other expenses of $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 16.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 12.4% of net sales in the prior year quarter. The 360-bps increase was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in certain fixed expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
14 Table of Contents
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income of $2.8 million as a result of insurance proceeds received related to the settlement of the environmental remediation liability. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

Income tax expense was $0.6 million, or an effective rate of 17.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to an income tax benefit of $1.2 million, or an effective rate of 13.8% during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was primarily impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with movements in certain deferred tax assets.
Net income was $2.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net loss of $7.5 million, or ($1.13) per diluted share in the prior year.
Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022, vs. 2021
Net sales were $188.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net sales of $279.4 million in the prior-year six-month period, a decrease of 32.4%. The decrease in sales of $90.5 million was primarily driven by $80.8 million related to home furnishing products sold through retailers and $9.7 million for home furnishing products sold through e-commerce channels. The sales decrease was primarily driven by the same factors discussed above for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was 16.5%, compared to 11.8% for the prior-year six-month period, an increase of 470 bps. The 470-bps increase was primarily driven by the same factors discussed above for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior-year six-month period.
The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume related expenses of $2.9 million and a decrease in all other expenses of $4.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.
As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 15.6% in the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior-year six-month period of 13.0%. The 260-bps increase was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in certain fixed expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income of $2.8 million related to the settlement of the environmental remediation liability. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, no additional restructuring expenses were realized for our facilities listed as held for sale. See Note 5, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of one of our Harrison, Arkansas facilities, resulting in total net proceeds of $1.45 million, and a total gain of $1.4 million.
Income tax expense was $0.4 million, or an effective rate of 11.5%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million in the prior-year six-month period, or an effective tax rate of (3.4%). The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions, as well as the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with movements in certain deferred tax assets.
Net income was $3.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net loss of $3.2 million, or ($0.47) per diluted share in the prior-year six-month period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) on December 31, 2022, was $107.1 million compared to $125.4 million on June 30, 2022. The $18.3 million decrease in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $30.4 million, a decrease in net trade receivables of $8.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $14.5 million, a decrease in the environmental liability of $3.6 million, an increase in other current assets of $2.0 million, a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.7

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $24.6 million, which primarily consisted of net income of $3.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation of $2.3 million, and stock-based compensation of $1.7 million. Net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was $17.7 million and was primarily due to a decrease in inventories of $30.4 million, and a decrease in trade receivables of $8.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities of $4.9 million, a decrease in payables of $14.1 million, an increase in other current assets of $2.0 million, and a decrease in other long-term liabilities of $0.3 million. Sales volume declines have driven the decrease in trade receivables, as well as decreased inventory purchases driving declines in inventory and payables. Accrued liabilities declined primarily due to the environmental remediation settlement.
For the six months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $41.0 million, which primarily consisted of net loss of $3.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation of $2.7 million, gain from the sale of capital assets of $1.9 million, stock-based compensation of $2.2 million, and provisions for losses of $0.2 million. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $41.0 million and was primarily due to an increase in inventory of $17.9 million due to continued inventory build, a decrease in accounts payable of $29.5 million, an increase in other current assets of $0.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $0.1 million, and partially offset by a decrease in trade receivables of $5.8 million.
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million, due to capital expenditures of $2.2 million.
For the six months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.4 million, primarily due to proceeds of $1.94 million from the sale of our Harrison, Arkansas, facility and the sale of our transportation fleet equipment, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.54 million.
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $22.9 million, primarily due to payments on lines of credit of $185.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from lines of credit of $166.9 million. In addition to the line of credit activity, net cash used in financing activities was also due to $2.2 million for treasury stock purchases, dividends paid of $1.7 million, and $0.4 million for tax payments on employee vested restricted shares netted with proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
For the six months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.3 million, primarily due to proceeds from lines of credit of $81.3 million, offset by payments on lines of credit of $25.0 million, $9.7 million for treasury stock purchases, dividends paid of $3.1 million, and $0.2 million for tax payments on employee vested restricted shares.
Line of Credit
On August 28, 2020, the Company entered a two-year secured $25.0 million revolving line of credit with Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, with an interest rate of 1.50% plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of 3.00%. The revolving line of credit was secured by essentially all the Company’s assets, excluding real property, and required the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. This line of credit was subsequently canceled in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2022.
On September 8, 2021, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Lender”), and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement has a five-year term and provides for up to an $85 million revolving line of credit. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters

of credit in an aggregate amount up to $5 million which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the revolving line of credit. The Company’s $1.1 million letters of credit previously issued by the Lender are being treated as outstanding under the Credit Agreement and reduce the amount of available borrowings under the revolving line of credit.
Proceeds of borrowings were used to refinance all indebtedness owed to Dubuque Bank & Trust and for working capital purposes. The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all its assets, excluding real property. Subject to certain conditions, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% or 1.50% per annum, or an effective interest rate of 5.6% on December 31, 2022. When LIBOR becomes unavailable, the replacement rate will be determined pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a financial covenant to maintain a fixed coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to1.00. In addition, the Loan Agreement places restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.
On April 18, 2022, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a first amendment to the September 8, 2021, Credit Agreement (“First Amendment to the Credit Agreement”), with the Lender and the lenders thereto.
The amendment to the Credit Agreement changed the definition of the term ‘Payment Conditions’ and further defines “default” or “event of default” and the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
As of December 31, 2022, there was $19.2 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement, exclusive of fees and letters of credit.
Letters of credit outstanding at the Lender as of December 31, 2022, totaled $1.1 million.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
General
– Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.
As discussed below, the management of the Company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located, disruptions associated with shipping distances, and negotiations with port employees. Other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and/or quotas; duties, tariffs, and taxes on imports; and significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.
Any of these factors could interrupt supply, decrease sales, increase costs and decrease earnings.
Foreign Currency Risk
– During the quarters ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have sales, but had purchases and other expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices is not considered significant.
Interest Rate Risk
– The Company’s primary market risk exposure regarding financial instruments is changes in interest rates.
On December 31, 2022, the Company had $19.2 million outstanding on its line of credit, exclusive of fees and letters of credit.
