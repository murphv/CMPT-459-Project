The significant accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the July 30, 2022 Village Super Market, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with these financial statements.  The results of operations for the period ended January 28, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES          At both January 28, 2023 and July 30, 2022, approximately
61 % of merchandise inventories are valued by the LIFO method while the balance is valued by FIFO.  If the FIFO method had been used for the entire inventory, inventories would have been $ 19,904
and $ 18,616
higher than reported at January 28, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. 3.
NET INCOME PER SHARE     The Company has
two
classes of common stock. Class A common stock is entitled to cash dividends as declared
54 % greater than those paid on Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common stock at any time.     The Company utilizes the two-class method of computing and presenting net income per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income per share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, Class A common stock is assumed to receive a
54 % greater participation in undistributed earnings than Class B common stock, in accordance with the classes' respective dividend rights. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing net income per share using the two-class method. 8     Diluted net income per share for Class A common stock is calculated utilizing the if-converted method, which assumes the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis, as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Diluted net income per share for Class B common stock does not assume conversion of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock. The table below reconciles Net income to Net income available to Class A and Class B shareholders: 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Net income $ 12,322   $ 10,129   $ 23,405   $ 17,457   Distributed and allocated undistributed Net income to unvested restricted shareholders 339   298   644   521   Net income available to Class A and Class B shareholders $ 11,983   $ 9,831   $ 22,761   $ 16,936       The tables below reconcile the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted Net income per share for all periods presented.   13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended   January 28, 2023 January 28, 2023   Class A Class B Class A Class B Numerator:         Net income allocated, basic $ 9,342   $ 2,642   $ 17,743   $ 5,017   Conversion of Class B to Class A shares 2,642   —   5,017   —   Net income allocated, diluted $ 11,984   $ 2,642   $ 22,760   $ 5,017   Denominator:         Weighted average shares outstanding, basic 9,863   4,294   9,863   4,294   Conversion of Class B to Class A shares 4,294   —   4,294   —   Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted 14,157   4,294   14,157   4,294   13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended   January 29, 2022 January 29, 2022   Class A Class B Class A Class B Numerator:         Net income allocated, basic $ 7,666   $ 2,165   $ 13,204   $ 3,732   Conversion of Class B to Class A shares 2,165   —   3,732   —   Net income allocated, diluted $ 9,831   $ 2,165   $ 16,936   $ 3,732   Denominator:         Weighted average shares outstanding, basic 9,873   4,294   9,868   4,294   Conversion of Class B to Class A shares 4,294   —   4,294   —   Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted 14,167   4,294   14,162   4,294       Outstanding stock options to purchase Class A shares of

and
380
non-vested restricted Class A shares, which are considered participating securities, and their allocated net income were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effect. 9 4.

with an insurance company for all participants who did not elect a lump sum distribution. The Company recognized a $ 12,296
pre-tax settlement charge as a result of the termination, including a $ 10,856
non-cash charge for unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the termination date. No benefit obligation or plan assets related to the Village Super Market, Inc. Employees’ Retirement Plan remain as of January 28, 2023.

New Markets Tax Credit Financing On December 29, 2017, the Company entered into a financing transaction with Wells Fargo Community Investment Holdings, LLC (“Wells Fargo”) under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) program related to the construction of a new store in the Bronx, New York. The NMTC program was provided for in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (the “Act”) and is intended to induce capital investment in qualified lower income communities. The Act permits taxpayers to claim credits against their Federal income taxes for up to 39% of qualified investments in the equity of community development entities (“CDEs”). CDEs are privately managed investment institutions that are certified to make qualified low-income community investments. In connection with the financing, the Company loaned $ 4,835
to VSM Investment Fund, LLC (the "Investment Fund") at an interest rate of   1.403 % per year and with a maturity date of December 31, 2044.  Repayments on the loan commence in March 2025. Wells Fargo contributed $ 2,375
to the Investment Fund and, by virtue of such contribution, is entitled to substantially all of the tax benefits derived from the NMTC.
The Investment Fund is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo.
The loan to the Investment Fund is recorded in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Investment Fund then contributed the proceeds to a CDE, which, in turn, loaned combined funds of $ 6,563 , net of debt issuance costs, to Village Super Market of NY, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, at an interest rate of  1.000 % per year with a maturity date of December 31, 2051. These loans are secured by the leasehold improvements and equipment related to the construction of the Bronx store. Repayment of the loans commences in March 2025. The proceeds of the loans from the CDE were used to partially fund the construction of the Bronx store. The Notes payable related to New Markets Tax Credit, net of debt issuance costs, are recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. The NMTC is subject to 100% recapture for a period of seven years. The Company is required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the New Markets Tax Credit arrangement. Noncompliance could result in Wells Fargo's projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, require the Company to indemnify Wells Fargo for any loss or recapture of NMTCs. The Company does not anticipate any credit recapture will be required in connection with this financing arrangement. The transaction includes a put/call provision whereby the Company may be obligated or entitled to repurchase Wells Fargo's interest in the Investment Fund. The value attributed to the put/call is de minimis. We believe that Wells Fargo will exercise the put option in December 2024, at the end of the recapture period, that will result in a net benefit to the Company of $ 1,728 . The Company is recognizing the net benefit over the seven-year compliance period in operating and administrative expense.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in SOFR related to the Company’s Credit Facility. The Company manages exposure to this risk and the variability of related cash flows primarily by the use of derivative financial instruments, specifically, interest rate swaps.
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate swaps are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
As of January 28, 2023, the Company had
five
interest rate swaps with an aggregate initial notional value of $ 99,975
to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate loans under the Company's Credit Facility. The interest rate swaps were executed for risk management and are not held for trading purposes.
The objective of the interest rate swaps is to hedge the variability of cash flows resulting from fluctuations in the reference rate. The swaps replaced the applicable reference rate with fixed interest rates and payments are settled monthly when payments are made on the variable-rate loans. The Company's derivatives qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive
12 income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the variable-rate loans. The Company reclassified $ 506
and $ 85
during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, and
$ 748
and $ 173
during the 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Interest expense. The notional value of the interest rate swaps were $ 81,558
as of January 28, 2023. The fair value of interest rate swaps recorded in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets is $ 8,284
as of January 28, 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Thousands) OVERVIEW     Village Super Market, Inc. (the “Company” or “Village”) was founded in 1937.  Village operates a chain of 34 supermarkets in New Jersey (26), New York (6), Maryland (1) and Pennsylvania (1) under the ShopRite and Fairway banners and four Gourmet Garage specialty markets in New York City. Village is the second largest member of Wakefern Food Corporation (“Wakefern”), the nation’s largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names. As further described in the Company’s Form 10-K, this ownership interest in Wakefern provides Village with many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with chains of greater size and geographic coverage. The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats, both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores.
The Company competes by providing a superior customer service experience, competitive pricing and a broad range of consistently available quality products.
The ShopRite Price Plus customer loyalty program enables Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to offer discounts and attach digital coupons directly to a customer's Price Plus card.
Online grocery ordering for in-store pick up or home delivery is available in all of our ShopRite stores through shoprite.com, the ShopRite app or through third party service providers. Additionally, the ShopRite Order Express app enables customers to pre-order deli, catering, specialty occasion cakes and other items.
Online ordering for home delivery is available in all Fairway and Gourmet Garage stores through third party service providers.
To promote production efficiency, product quality and consistency, the Company operates a centralized commissary supplying certain products in deli, bakery, prepared foods and other perishable product categories to all stores. The Company also owns and operates an automated micro-fulfillment center to facilitate online order fulfillment for the south New Jersey stores.
The Company’s stores, eight of which are owned, average 54,000 total square feet. These larger store sizes enable the Company to offer a wide variety of national branded and locally sourced food products, including grocery, meat, produce, dairy, deli, seafood, prepared foods, bakery and frozen foods as well as non-food product offerings, including health and beauty care, general merchandise, liquor and 21 in-store pharmacies.
Most product departments include high-quality, competitively priced own-brand offerings under the Wholesome Pantry, Bowl & Basket, Paperbird and Fairway brands.
Our Fairway Markets offer a one-stop destination shopping experience with an emphasis on fresh, unique, and high quality offerings paired with an expansive variety of natural, organic, specialty and gourmet products.
Our Gourmet Garage specialty markets offer organic produce, signature soups and prepared foods, high-quality meat and seafood, charcuterie and gourmet cheeses, artisan baked bread and pastries, chef-prepared meals to go and pantry staples.
The Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain.  This program has included store remodels as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores.  When remodeling, Village has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its stores.
On August 14, 2022, we converted the Pelham, NY store from the Fairway banner to the ShopRite banner and a major remodel of the store was completed in late October 2022.
On April 29, 2022, Village opened a 14,600 sq. ft. Gourmet Garage in the West Village in Manhattan, NYC.
We consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance, such as same store sales; percentage of total sales by department (mix); shrink; departmental gross profit percentage; sales per labor hour; units per labor hour; and hourly labor rates. 14 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The following table sets forth the major components of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of sales:   13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended   January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Sales 100.00  % 100.00  % 100.00  % 100.00  % Cost of sales 72.53  72.16  71.93  71.91  Gross profit 27.47  27.84  28.07  28.09  Operating and administrative expense 23.07  23.54  23.60  24.02  Depreciation and amortization 1.54  1.58  1.58  1.62  Operating income 2.86  2.72  2.89  2.45  Interest expense (0.17) (0.18) (0.19) (0.19) Interest income 0.48  0.17  0.43  0.18  Income before income taxes 3.17  2.71  3.13  2.44  Income taxes 0.98  0.83  0.97  0.75  Net income 2.19  % 1.88  % 2.16  % 1.69  %      Sales .  Sales were $563,866 in the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023, an increase of 4.9% compared to the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022.  Sales increased due to an increase in same store sales of 3.2%, the opening of a Gourmet Garage in the West Village in Manhattan, NY on April 29, 2022 and increased sales due to the remodel and conversion of the Pelham, NY Fairway to the ShopRite banner on August 15, 2022.
Same store sales increased due primarily to retail price inflation. Sales were $1,083,555 in the 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023, an increase of 5.0% compared to the 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022.

Operating and Administrative Expense.   Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased .47% in the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022 due primarily to lower labor costs and fringe benefits (.41%) and decreased supply spending (.13%).
Labor costs and fringe benefits decreased due primarily to sales leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset by minimum wage and market-driven pay rate increases.
Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased .42% in the 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to the 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022 due primarily to

Labor costs and fringe benefits decreased due primarily to sales leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset by minimum wage and market-driven pay rate increases.
15 Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022 due primarily to capital expenditures.
Interest Expense .  Interest expense increased in the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022 due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances.
Interest Income .  Interest income increased in the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022 due primarily to higher interest rates and larger amounts invested in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern and demand deposits at Wakefern.
Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rate was 30.9% in the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to 30.7% in both the 13 and 26 weeks ended January 29, 2022. The increase in the effective income tax rate is due primarily to greater apportionment in higher state tax rate jurisdictions.
Net Income .  Net Income was $12,322 in the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to net income of $10,129 in the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  These policies require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The Company’s critical accounting policies relating to the impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, accounting for patronage dividends earned as a stockholder of Wakefern and accounting for pension plans, are described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 30, 2022.  A s of January 28, 2023, there have been no changes to the critical accounting policies contained therein.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $48,357 in the 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023 compared to $40,274 in the corresponding period of the prior year.  The change in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by changes in working capital.
Working capital changes, including Other assets and liabilities, increased cash flows from operating activities by $4,275 in fiscal 2023 compared to a increase of $4,986 in fiscal 2022. The change in impact of working capital is due primarily to increased merchandise inventories, the timing of tax payments, accounts payable to Wakefern and accounts payable and accrued expenses .
During the 26 weeks ended January 28, 2023, Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of $28,550, dividends of $6,507, principal payments of long-term debt of $4,903, an investment in a real estate partnership for the development of a retail center in Old Bridge, New Jersey of $3,319 and additional net investments of $32,573 in notes receivable from Wakefern.  Capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with the remodel and conversion of the Pelham, NY Fairway to the ShopRite banner, the new Gourmet Garage store in the West Village of New York City, the purchase of the Vineland store shopping center,
installation of electronic shelf labels, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades.     We have revised our budgeted capital expenditures downward from prior estimates to approximately $60,000 in fiscal 2023 due to the timing of construction spends for replacement stores shifting from fiscal 2023 into fiscal 2024.  Planned
16 expenditures include costs for construction of three replacement stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, two major remodels, including the conversion of the Pelham, NY store from the Fairway to the ShopRite banner, the purchase of the Vineland store shopping center, several smaller store remodels and merchandising initiatives, installation of electronic shelf labels in six stores, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal 2023 are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at January 28, 2023 and operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2023. On April 28, 2022 the Company entered into a partnership agreement for 30% interest in the development of a retail center in Old Bridge, New Jersey, which includes a Village replacement store with future lease obligations of $9,280. Village will fund its share of project costs estimated to be $15,000 to $20,000 over the two to three year life of the project. As of January 28, 2023, Village has invested $8,329 into the real estate partnership, which is accounted for as an equity method investment included in Investments in Real Estate Partnerships on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
On August 15, 2022, notes receivable due from Wakefern of $28,850 that earned interest at the prime rate plus 1.25% matured. The Company invested all of the proceeds received in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50% and mature on August 15, 2027.
On September 28, 2022, the Company invested an additional $30,000 in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50% and mature on September 28, 2027.
At January 28, 2023, the Company held variable rate notes receivable due from Wakefern of $30,171 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .75% and mature on February 15, 2024, $29,615 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .50% and mature on August 15, 2027 and $30,571 that earn interest at the prime rate plus
.50% and mature on September 28, 2027.
Wakefern has the right to prepay these notes at any time. Under certain conditions, the Company can require Wakefern to prepay the notes, although interest earned since inception would be reduced as if it was earned based on overnight money market rates as paid by Wakefern on demand deposits.
Working capital was $34,299 at January 28, 2023 compared to $79,796 at July 30, 2022. Working capital ratios at the same dates were 1.21 and 1.50 to one, respectively.   The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is due primarily to $28,850 in notes receivable from Wakefern that matured on August 15, 2022 and were reinvested in long-term notes receivable from Wakefern and an additional $30,017 investment in long-term notes receivable from Wakefern.
The Company’s working capital needs are reduced, since inventories are generally sold by the time payments to Wakefern and other suppliers are due. Credit Facility The Company has a credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Wells Fargo National Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”). The principal purpose of the Credit Facility is to finance general corporate and working capital requirements, Village’s fiscal 2020 acquisition of certain Fairway assets and certain capital expenditures.

The term loan is secured by the Galloway store shopping center acquired for $9,800 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
17 On September 1, 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility due to the execution of a seven year $10,000 unsecured term loan. The unsecured term loan is repayable in equal monthly installments based on a seven year amortization schedule through September 4, 2029 and bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 1.35%. Village also executed an interest rate swap for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base SOFR at 2.95%, resulting in a fixed effective rate of 4.30%.

Net of the subsidy, the Company will pay interest at a fixed effective rate of 2.30%. On January 27, 2023, the Company purchased the Vineland store shopping center for $9,500.
As part of the purchase, the Company amended the Credit Facility due to the execution of a fifteen year $7,125 term loan secured by the Vineland store shopping center.

Village also executed an interest rate swap for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base SOFR at 3.59%, resulting in a fixed effective rate of 5.34%.
Based on current trends, the Company believes cash and cash equivalents on hand at January 28, 2023, operating cash flow and availability under our Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months.     There have been no other substantial changes as of January 28, 2023 to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 30, 2022.
OUTLOOK     This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements about Village’s future performance. These statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available.  Such statements relate to, for example:  same store sales; economic conditions; expected pension plan contributions; projected capital expenditures; cash flow requirements; inflation expectations; and legal matters; and are indicated by words such as “will,” “expect,”  “should,” “intend,” “anticipates,” “believes” and similar words or phrases.  The Company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from the results expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof. • We expect the increase in same store sales to range from 2.0% to 4.0% in fiscal 2023. • We have revised our budgeted capital expenditures downward from prior estimates to approximately $60,000 in fiscal 2023 due to the timing of construction spends for replacement stores shifting from fiscal 2023 into fiscal 2024.
Planned expenditures include costs for construction of three replacement stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, two major remodels, including the conversion of the Pelham, NY store from the Fairway to the ShopRite banner, the purchase of the Vineland store shopping center, several smaller store remodels and merchandising initiatives, installation of electronic shelf labels in six stores, continued expansion of self-checkout, and various technology, equipment and facility upgrades.
• The Board’s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023 at the most recent rate of $.25 per Class A and $.1625 per Class B share. • We believe cash and cash equivalents on hand, operating cash flow and the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
• We expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 31.0% - 32.0%. 18 Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These include: • The COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility and uncertainty in our business since the first outbreak in our trade area in March 2020.
Its continuing impact and the impact of new virus variants and the measures taken in response could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We continue to monitor and adjust the safety measures we have implemented since the beginning of the pandemic.
Our business may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, inflation, disruptions to supply chains, higher operating and/or compliance costs, changes in customer trends and consumer demand, changes in federal, state and local laws, regulations and community response measures, the form and impact of economic stimulus, our customers access to and the continued availability of government benefit programs through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") and general overall economic instability.
It is unclear whether and to what extent sales, consumer behavior, general economic and business activity will return to pre-pandemic levels and its impact on our business.
Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis may exacerbate other risks and uncertainties included herein, which could have a material effect on the Company. • The Fairway acquisition involves a number of risks, uncertainties and challenges, including under-performance relative to our expectations, additional capital requirements, unforeseen expenses or delays, imprecise assumptions or our inability to achieve projected cost savings or other synergies, competitive factors in the marketplace and difficulties integrating the business, including merging company cultures, cultivating brand strategy, expansion of food production and conforming the acquired company's technology, standards, processes, procedures and controls.
Sales and operating profits have underperformed in Manhattan due primarily to less residential, commuter and tourist traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the diversion of management time and resources.
• The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins.  Results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs, industry consolidation and competitor store openings.  Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do.   • The Company’s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in these states in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole. Economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rate fluctuations, movements in energy costs, social programs, minimum wage legislation, unemployment rates, disturbances due to social unrest and changing demographics may adversely affect our sales and profits. • Village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including advertising, workers' compensation, liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, and other store services. Further, Village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern and also has demand deposits and notes receivable due from Wakefern. Any material change in Wakefern’s method of operation or a termination or material modification of Village’s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company’s business and could involve additional expense for Village.  The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to Wakefern or a member’s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to the Company.  Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern’s results of operations could have an adverse effect on Village’s results of operations. • Approximately 88% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results. If we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs. • The Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain.  The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 19 • Certain of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan’s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, withdrawals by other participating employers and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors. • The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property, director and officers’ liability, and certain employee health care benefits.
Any projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and insolvency of insurance carriers could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. • Our long-lived assets, primarily store property, equipment and fixtures, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. • Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, for impairment. Failure of acquired businesses to achieve their forecasted expectations could result in impairment charges to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. • Our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws. • Wakefern provides all members of the cooperative with information system support that enables us to effectively manage our business data, customer transactions, ordering, communications and other business processes.  These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and related malicious software, catastrophic weather events, or human error.  Any material interruption of our or Wakefern’s information systems could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, personal information about our customers, vendors and associates is received and stored in these information systems. In addition, confidential information is transmitted through our online business at shoprite.com and through the ShopRite app. Unauthorized parties may attempt to access information stored in or to sabotage or disrupt these systems. Wakefern and the Company maintain substantial security measures to prevent and detect unauthorized access to such information, including utilizing third-party service providers for monitoring our networks, security reviews, and other functions. It is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may be able to defeat the security measures in place at the Company, Wakefern or those of third-party service providers. Any breach of these security measures and loss of confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, could damage our reputation with customers, vendors and associates, cause Wakefern and Village to incur significant costs to protect any customers, vendors and associates whose personal data was compromised, cause us to make changes to our information systems and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation against Wakefern and/or Village from outside parties. Any such breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity if the related costs to Wakefern and Village are not covered or are in excess of carried insurance policies. In addition, a security breach could require Wakefern and Village to devote significant management resources to address problems created by the security breach and restore our reputation. 20 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       See note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on related party transactions.
