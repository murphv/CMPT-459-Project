INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
We are not a Hong Kong operating
company but a Delaware holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and the British
Virgin Islands. Our investors hold shares of common stock in King Resources, Inc., the Delaware holding company. This structure presents
unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong operating subsidiary and will be dependent upon
contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Our ability to obtain contributions from our subsidiaries are significantly
affected by regulations promulgated by Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”) authorities. Any change
in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations may materially affect our operations
and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a
detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to “ Risk Factors – Risk
Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China .” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on June 24, 2022 (the “Annual Report”).
We currently operate in Hong
Kong, and we intend to expand distribution of our products into China and other Asia markets as opportunities permit. While we have no
current intention of expanding our physical presence or operations into China, we expect to become directly subject to all PRC laws with
all risks described herein relating to the PRC to increase if we develop such physical presence or establish operations in China.
King Resources, Inc. and its
Hong Kong and British Virgin Islands subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign
investors. In making this determination, we relied on the legal opinion of Ravenscroft & Schmierer, a copy of which is attached as
Exhibit 5 to the Company’s Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on April 21, 2022 (the “Form 10”). However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government,
such as those related to the extension of China’s oversight and control into Hong Kong, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting
foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we
may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that the PRC
government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability
to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to
offer securities to our investors. If our subsidiary or the holding company were required to obtain approvals in the future, or we erroneously
conclude that approvals were not required, or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, our operations
may materially change, our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors or to continue listing on a U.S. exchange
may be adversely affected, and the value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect
the interest of the investors. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the
CSRC, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities
to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become
worthless.
There may be prominent risks
associated with our operations being in Hong Kong and China. For example, as a U.S.-listed Hong Kong public company, we may
face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of
our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes in Chinese internal regulatory
mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the Data Security Law, and recent statements and regulatory actions by the
PRC government such as those related to the use of variable interest entities, data security and anti-monopoly concerns, may target the
Company's corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong and China, accept foreign investments, or list on
an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations
in Hong Kong and future operations in China, please refer to “ Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in
Hong Kong and China .” set forth in the Annual Report.

The recent joint statement
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”),
and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”) all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied
to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected
by the PCAOB. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate
completely our auditor, and that as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed
the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required
for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited
from trading or being delisted. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted rules to implement the HFCAA. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued
its report notifying the Commission that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely accounting firms headquartered in mainland
China or Hong Kong due to positions taken by authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our auditor is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
and is subject to PCAOB’s inspection. It is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However,
in the event the Malaysian authorities subsequently take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to
change our auditor to avoid having our securities delisted. Furthermore, due to the recent developments in connection with the implementation
of the HFCAA, we cannot assure you whether the SEC or other regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria
to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel
and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements. The
requirement in the HFCAA that the PCAOB be permitted to inspect the issuer’s public accounting firm within two or three years, may
result in the delisting of our securities from applicable trading markets in the U.S, in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect
our accounting firm at such future time. Please see “ Risk Factors – The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years.
This three-year period will be shortened to two years if the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is enacted. There
are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies
to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable
to conduct such investigations, they may suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and delist our securities from applicable
trading market within the US. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
In addition to the foregoing
risks, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties arising from doing business in Hong Kong and China as summarized
below and in “ Risk Factors – Risks Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China. ” set forth in the
Annual Report.
·
There are significant risks associated with our operations being based in Hong Kong. Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the Hong Kong and PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in China and Hong Kong, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Please see “ Risk Factors – We face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong currently, and in the future, in China, and the profitability of such business.” and “Substantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political, legal and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong and the PRC, and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition .” set forth in the Annual Report.
·
We are a holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary based in Hong Kong. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiary to finance our cash flow needs. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiary to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future; you should not buy our stock if you expect dividends. Please see “ Risk Factors – Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other cash payments, our ability to pay dividends or make other cash payments is limited.”
set forth in the Annual Report.
iii
·
There is a possibility that the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business or for the payment of dividends. We rely on dividends from our Hong Kong subsidiary for our cash and financing requirements, such as the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements, service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. Please see “Risk Factors – Our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity requirements, conduct business and pay dividends to holders of our common stock.”; “Risk Factors - PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.”; “Risk Factors - Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other cash payments, our ability to pay dividends or make other payments is limited.” and “Transfers of Cash to and from our Subsidiaries.” set forth in the Annual Report.
·
PRC regulation of loans to and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong. Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. Please see “ Risk Factors – PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business .” set forth in the Annual Report.
·
In light of China’s extension of its authority into Hong Kong, we are subject to risks arising from the legal system in Hong Kong and China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and that rules and regulations in Hong Kong and China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. There is also a risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in Hong Kong or PRC based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities (including the CSRC and the CAC) to operate or to list on U.S. exchanges. However, to the extent that the Chinese government exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in Hong Kong-based issuers over time and if our subsidiary or the holding company were required to obtain approvals in the future, or we erroneously conclude that approvals were not required, or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, our operations may materially change, our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors or to continue listing on a U.S. exchange may be significantly limited or completely hindered, and the value of our common stock (including those we are registering for sale now or in the future) may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. To the extent that we expand our operations into China, all of the foregoing risks will become more prominent and directly applicable to us, and significantly adverse policies from the PRC may force us to divest of such Chinese operations or face other risks of forfeiture. Please see “ Risk Factors
–
We face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong currently, and in the future, in China, and the profitability of such business.”, “Substantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political, legal and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong and the PRC, and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition.” and “The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of a Hong Kong company’s business operations or to exert control over any offering of securities conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, and may intervene with or influence our operations, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless, as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
iv
·
Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.
·
We may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection, especially if we expand operations or physical presence into China. We may be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers. Please see “ Risk Factors – The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of a Hong Kong company’s business operations or to exert control over any offering of securities conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, and may intervene with or influence our operations, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless, as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
·
Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (“EIT Law”), we may be classified as a “Resident Enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders. Please see “ Risk Factors – Our global income may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
·
Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident Shareholders to personal liability, may limit our ability to acquire Hong Kong and PRC companies or to inject capital into our Hong Kong subsidiary, may limit the ability of our Hong Kong subsidiaries to distribute profits to us or may otherwise materially and adversely affect us.
·
You may be subject to PRC income tax on dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of shares of our common stock. Please see “ Risk Factors – Dividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our shares of common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to tax by the PRC.”
set forth in the Annual Report.
·
We face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies. Please see “ Risk Factors – We and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.”
set forth in the Annual Report.
·
We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, bring actions in Hong Kong against us or our management or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries. Please see “ Risk Factors – Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in Hong Kong based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.
set forth in the Annual Report.
·
U.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.
·
There are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable by our PRC subsidiary to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits. Please see “ Risk Factors – Our global income may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
References in this registration
statement to the “Company,” “KRFG,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to King Resources,
Inc., a Delaware company and all of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Where reference to a specific entity is required, the name
of such specific entity will be referenced.
v
Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries
King Resources, Inc. is a
Delaware holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in Hong Kong primarily through our operating subsidiary
in Hong Kong, and most of our cash is maintained in Hong Kong Dollars. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our Hong Kong or British
Virgin Islands subsidiaries to fund our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash
distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. There is a possibility that the
PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business
or for the payment of dividends. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements,
service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. If our Hong Kong subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in
the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. To date, our
subsidiaries have not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to King Resources, Inc. and King Resources, Inc. has not made any
transfers, dividends or distributions to its subsidiaries.
King Resources, Inc. is permitted
under Delaware laws to provide funding to our subsidiaries in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands through loans or capital contributions
without restrictions on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements.
Our Hong Kong subsidiary, Powertech Corporation Limited (“Powertech Corp”), and British Virgin Islands subsidiary, Powertech
Management Limited, are also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands to provide funding to King Resources,
Inc. through dividend distributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds. As of the date of this report, there has been no
dividends or distributions among the parent company or the subsidiaries nor do we expect such dividends or distributions to occur in the
foreseeable future among the parent company and its subsidiaries.
We currently intend to retain
all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying
any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business
prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments.
Currently, the treasury function
of King Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries is centralized and operated by the finance department of Powertech Corporation Limited located
in Hong Kong under the management of its chief financial officer. In order to provide a process and guidance on collecting, accounting
for, and safeguarding all cash and cash equivalents of King Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries, we have established a cash management
policy that includes procedures on receiving funds, depositing funds, and proper documentation and recording of cash.
Subject to the Delaware General
Corporation Law and our bylaws, our board of directors may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time and of such an
amount as they think fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value of our assets
will exceed our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts as they become due. There is no further Delaware statutory restriction
on the amount of funds which may be distributed by us by dividend.
Under the current practice
of the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, no tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by us. The laws and regulations
of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from King Resources, Inc. to our Hong Kong subsidiary or from
our Hong Kong subsidiary to King Resources, Inc. There are no restrictions or limitation under the laws of Hong Kong imposed on the conversion
of Hong Kong dollar into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of Hong Kong or across borders and to U.S. investors.
There is a possibility that
the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business
or for the payment of dividends. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements,
service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders.
Please see “Risk Factors – Our Hong Kong subsidiary
may be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity
requirements, conduct business and pay dividends to holders of our common stock.”; “Risk Factors – PRC regulation of
loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay
or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions
to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.”;
“Risk Factors – Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other cash payments,
our ability to pay dividends or make other payments is limited.”
set forth in the Annual Report.
vi
Current PRC regulations permit
PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Hong Kong subsidiaries only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of
its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of
such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although
the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be
used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective
companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this report,
we do not have any PRC subsidiaries.
The PRC government also imposes
controls on the conversion of Renminbi (“RMB”) into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore,
we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency to finance our
cash requirements, service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC
incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.
If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common
stock.
Cash dividends, if any, on
our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay
to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of
up to 10%.
In order for us to pay dividends
to our shareholders, we will rely on payments made from our Hong Kong subsidiary to King Resources, Inc. If in the future we have PRC
subsidiaries, certain payments from such PRC subsidiaries to our Hong Kong subsidiary will be subject to PRC taxes, including business
taxes and Value-added tax. As of the date of this report, we do not have any PRC subsidiaries and our Hong Kong subsidiary has not made
any transfers, dividends or distributions nor do we expect to make such transfer, dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future.
Pursuant to the Arrangement
between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income,
or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no
less than 25% of a PRC entity. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied,
including, without limitation, that (a) the Hong Kong entity must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong
Kong entity must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC entity during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt
of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong entity must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply
for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case
basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and
enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by a PRC
subsidiary to its immediate holding company. As of the date of this report, we do not have a PRC subsidiary. In the event that we acquire
or form a PRC subsidiary in the future and such PRC subsidiary desires to declare and pay dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiary, our Hong
Kong subsidiary will be required to apply for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. In such event, we
plan to inform the investors through SEC filings, such as a current report on Form 8-K, prior to such actions. See “ Risk Factors
– Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China .” set forth in the Annual Report.

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical
facts, included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s market projections, financial position, business strategy
and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); expansion
and growth of the Company's business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based
on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions
and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual
results or developments will conform with the Company's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and
pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company.
These forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as "believes," "anticipates,"
"expects," "estimates," "plans," "may," "will," or similar terms. These statements appear
in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, and its
directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations
for its limited history; (ii) the Company's business and growth strategies; and (iii) the Company's financing plans. Investors are cautioned
that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and
that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such
factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company's limited operating history,
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition. For information
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements,
please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on June
24, 2022.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or
developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence
to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.

NOTE – 2
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes.
·
Basis of presentation
These accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”).
5
·
Use of estimates and assumptions
In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance
sheet and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. If actual results significantly
differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
Significant estimates in the period include the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and deferred tax valuation allowance.
·
Basis of consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of KRFG and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company
have been eliminated upon consolidation.
·
Segment reporting
ASC Topic 280, “ Segment Reporting ”
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal organization
structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in
Hong Kong.
·
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
·
Accounts receivables
Accounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced
amount and do not bear interest, which are due within contractual payment terms, generally 30 to 90 days from completion of service. Credit
is extended based on evaluation of a customer's financial condition, the customer credit-worthiness and their payment history. Accounts
receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified
amount are reviewed individually for collectability. At the end of fiscal year, the Company specifically evaluates individual customer’s
financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to monitor the progress of the collection of accounts receivables.
The Company will consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are
taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against
the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does
not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, there was
no
allowance for doubtful accounts.
·
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market value (net realizable value), cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include material costs. The Company provides
inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand. During the three and nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 750
and $ 0
for periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
6
·
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade
names. The intangible assets are stated at the purchase cost and are amortized based on their economic benefits expected to be realized
and assessed for impairment annually. There was
no
impairment of intangible assets identified for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company amortizes
the trademarks over an estimated economic useful life of
ten
years .
·
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following
expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking into account their estimated residual values:
Schedule of estimated useful lives
Expected useful lives
Office equipment
3
years
Furniture and fixtures
3
years
Computer equipment
3
years
Expenditures for repair and maintenance are expensed
as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.
·
Website development costs
The Company accounts for its website development
costs in accordance with ASC 350-50,
Website Development Costs . These costs, if any, are included in intangible assets in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Upgrades or enhancements that add functionality are capitalized while other costs
during the operating stage are expensed as incurred. The Company amortizes the capitalized website development costs over an estimated
useful life of five years.
·
Impairment of long-lived assets
In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic
360,
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , all long-lived assets such as property and equipment owned and held by the Company
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured
by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. There has been
no
impairment charge for
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
·
Revenue recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”) using the full retrospective
transition method. The Company's adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized
in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
7
Under ASU 2014-09, the Company recognizes revenue
when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company applies the following five steps in
order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
·
identify the contract with a customer;
·
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
·
determine the transaction price;
·
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
·
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company’s services revenue is derived
from performing the research and development and technology development for the customers under fixed-price contracts. On fixed-price
contracts that are expected not more than one year in duration, revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method
based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. The Company receives periodic progress
payments.
Costs incurred in connection with the research
and development, are included in cost of revenue. Product development costs charged to billable projects are recorded as cost of revenue,
which consist primarily of costs associated with personnel, supplies and materials.
The Company’s trading revenue is recognized
when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer that obtains
control of the product and collection is reasonably assured. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct
product to a customer.
·
Government subsidy
A government subsidy is not recognized until there
is reasonable assurance that: (a) the enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to the grant; and (b) the grant will be received.
When the Company receives government subsidies but the conditions attached to the grants have not been fulfilled, such government subsidies
are deferred and recorded under other payables and accrued expenses, and other long-term liability. The classification of short-term or
long-term liabilities is depended on the management’s expectation of when the conditions attached to the grant can be fulfilled.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company received government subsidies of $ 927
and $ 0 . For the nine months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company received government subsidies of $ 9,185
and $ 0 .
·
Income taxes
The Company adopted the ASC 740
Income tax
provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a
tax return should be recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company
had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.
8
The estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs
and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides
valuation allowances as management deems necessary.
·
Uncertain tax positions
The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions
and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the three
and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
·
Net loss per share
The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance
with ASC Topic 260, “ Earnings per Share .” Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common
stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
·
Foreign currencies translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations.
The reporting currency of the Company is United
States Dollar ("US$") and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$.
In addition, the Company is operating in Hong Kong and maintains its books and record in its local currency, Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”),
which is a functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted. In general,
for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in
accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement ”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within
the statements of changes in stockholder’s equity.
Translation of amounts from HKD into US$ has
been made at the following exchange rates for the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
Schedule of translation rates
December 31,
2022
December 31,
2021
Period-end HKD:US$ exchange rate
0.1281
0.1284
Annualized average HKD:US$ exchange rate
0.1276
0.1287
9
·
Comprehensive income
ASC Topic 220, “ Comprehensive Income ”,
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income
as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented
in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, consists of changes in unrealized
gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or
benefit.
·
Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company
determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases with a term greater
than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities. The Company
has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding
right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. However, certain
adjustments to the right-of-use assets may be required for items such as prepaid or accrued lease payments. The interest rate implicit
in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are
the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic
environment.
In accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 842,
components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g.
common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.). Subsequently, the fixed and in-substance
fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values
to the lease components and non-lease components.
The Company made the policy election to not separate
lease and non-lease components. Each lease component and the related non-lease components are accounted for together as a single component.
·
Related parties
The Company follows the ASC 850-10,
Related
Party
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties
include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the
election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the
equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed
by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent
that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one
of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be
prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances,
and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation
of unaudited condensed consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:
a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or
nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary
to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each
of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that
used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if
not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.
10
·
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows the ASC 450-20,
Commitments
to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result
in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such
contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the
perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that
it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
be accrued in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon
information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
·
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value
hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification are described below:
Level 1
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3
Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their
fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant
model assumption or input is unobservable.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If
the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
11
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
·
Recent accounting pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to
cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
NOTE – 3
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company incurred recurring losses from
prior years and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $ 7,528,487
at December 31, 2022 resulting mainly from disruptions caused by
coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The outbreak
had caused substantial disruption in international economies and global trades and if repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged,
could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s business.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern
in the next twelve months is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. The Company is currently pursuing additional
financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain
the operations.
These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result
in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

Overview
We were incorporated in the
state of Delaware on September 8, 1995, under the name ARXA International Energy, Inc. On June 4, 2001, we changed our name to King Resources,
Inc., our current name.
On April 2, 2018, a change
of control occurred with respect to the Company. On October 18, 2018, Brian Kistler, the then sole director and executive resigned from
his position as the Chairman of the Board, and Junrong Yin was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by his resignation. On May 3, 2021,
Mr. Kistler resigned from his positions as CEO with the Company and appointed Caren Currier to fill the vacancies caused by his resignation.
On October 25, 2021, Caren
Currier entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Dr. Lee Ying Chiu Herbert (“Dr. Lee”) pursuant to which Ms. Currier agreed
to sell to Dr. Lee all 30 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company held by her for aggregate consideration of Four Hundred
Ten Thousand Dollars ($410,000). This transaction was consummated on November 10, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, Ms. Currier

Acquisition of Powertech
On December 15, 2021, we acquired
50,000 shares of Powertech Management Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Powertech”),
representing all of its issued and outstanding securities, from its shareholders Silver Bloom Properties Limited and FU Wah in exchange
for 2,835,820,896 shares of our Common Stock (“Share Exchange”). In connection with the acquisition, each of Silver Bloom
Properties Limited and FU Wah received 2,126,865,672 and 708,955,224 shares of our Common Stock, respectively. Powertech operates its
smart power supply business through its wholly owned subsidiary Powertech Corporation Limited, a limited liability company organized under
the laws of Hong Kong. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation
S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of Powertech.
19
Prior to the Share Exchange,
the Company was considered as a shell company due to its nominal assets and limited operation. The transaction was treated as a recapitalization
of the Company.
The Share Exchange between
the Company and Powertech on December 15, 2021 is deemed a merger of entities under common control for which FU Wah is the common director
and shareholder of both the Company and Powertech. Under the guidance in ASC 805 for transactions between entities under common control,
the assets, liabilities and results of operations, are recognized at their carrying amounts on the date of the Share Exchange, which required
the retrospective combination of the Company and Powertech for all periods presented.
Recent developments of the Company

Fu is the chair of our nomination and governance committee.
The Company believes that
the above actions are the first step for the Company to establish good corporate governance which could lead to corporate success and
growth in the future.
During the three months ended
December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a revenue of $169,580 and a net loss of $959,994. The significant drop in revenue was mainly attributable
to the global economic downturn. During this period, the Company started the distribution business, however, the material supply and logistic
of final products are still impacted by the effect of COVID-19. The pace of implementation of distribution business was hindered and only
a few sales were made as a result. The Company has tried its best to overcome the challenges in this tough situation and successfully
secured the supply chain subsequent to the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The management expects a sales rebound will occur in the next
quarter, together with the seasonal effect brought by Christmas and New Year Holiday, and expand to the oversea market when opportunity
permits.
Our Organization Structure
The following corporate organization
chart illustrates the current corporate structure of King Resources, Inc., including the jurisdiction of incorporation and ownership interest
of each of its subsidiaries:
21
King Resources, Inc. is a
holding company with no operations. It operates solely through its subsidiaries by providing innovative solutions and products with Healthcare,
Lifestyles, and Mobility elements.
We have five wholly-owned

Management Limited (“Powertech”), a BVI limited liability company formed in December 2021; (iii) Powertech Corporation Limited
(“Powertech Corp”), a Hong Kong limited liability company formed in January 2015; (iv) OneSolution Management Limited (“OSM”),
a BVI limited liability company formed in August 2022; and (v) OneSolution Innotech Limited (“OSIL”), a Hong Kong limited
liability company formed in September 2022, and we have two business focuses:
·
Powertech Corp focuses on (i) research and development solutions; (ii) sales of own brand smart power supply products, and (iii) development of IoT products across our smart home, smart office and smart fitness ecosystem;
·
OSIL has entered into several partnership agreements with brands selling innovative and lifestyle products. Currently, OSIL acts as the distributor of five brands, namely Aqigo, Brusheva, Qivation, Paudin and Team Cuisine.
We are currently preparing
to launch the Powertech Corp’s own brand smart power supply products on online store, and launching the sales of OSIL’s product
with channel partners by the end of 2022. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported a net loss of $959,994 and

Kong, and we seek to expand distribution of our products to Asia Pacific (“APAC”), Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)
and USA markets as opportunities permit. Our products are currently manufactured in China on a purchase order basis. As our distribution
increases, we expect to sub-contract our products elsewhere in Asia as pricing and coordination dictate. We have no intention of expanding
operations or our physical presence into China currently.
Products and Services
Currently, we are currently
preparing to launch the Powertech Corp’s own brand of smart power supply products on an online store. Meanwhile, the newly established
subsidiary, OSIL, acts as distributor in Hong Kong and has concluded several partnerships with five brands. We are building up our sales
channels for the following brands in retails and online store in Hong Kong and categorized the products into “Healthcare”,
“Lifestyle” and “Mobility”:

Qivation
Qivation offers innovative,
safe and convenient to use products which integrate as part of our home living. Qivation applies the Nano Photocatalyst technology approved
by Photocatalysis Industry Association of Japan (“PIAJ”) on its products which combined self-antibacterial and purification
function together with lighting. The use of TiO2 technology allows Qivation products to initiate an antimicrobial effect for sanitization
and air purification. It does not require any solvent, binders or alcohol, and can initiate the purifying process with visible light.
This technological breakthrough creates a giant leap in making use of TiO2 sanitization technology.
Other than self-antibacterial
and purification function, Qivation adopted the lighting software solutions by WiZ Connected under Signify (formerly known as Philips
Lighting) combined with the Nano Photocatalyst technology. The lighting products are adjustable shades of lightness up to 64,000 and up
to 16 million colors with preset well-being modes. We hope the Qivation products could reduce domestic health risks and creates a comforting
lifestyle setting at home or at office.

Future IoT Technology and Lifestyle Products
– The Smart Home Ecosystem
We believe that the smart
home ecosystem has become both in concept and reality a part of the common culture around the world. When homeowners or buyers consider
renovation or new construction, many of them are considering the possibility of implementing smart home ecosystem devices to their homes
due to increasing awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and lifestyle improvement of smart home products. According to International
Data Corporation (“IDC”) Worldwide Quarterly Smart Home Device Tracker, in 2021, the global market for smart home device increased
by 11.7% from 2020, with more than 895 million devices shipped. The Asia and the Pacific region is the second largest smart home device
region in terms of shipment volume. It accounts for 31% of shipment and has a year-on-year growth rate of 10.8%. Our research indicates
that more users are looking to purchase higher price smart devices such as smart TV and lighting fixtures in order to save energy and
increase controllability and convenience. We believe that as 5G technology becomes more stable and popular throughout the world, more
and more smart home appliances will become available in the market. We believe that smart home appliances with IoT and AI technology can
improve our users’ living standards and lifestyles dramatically.
23
Smart home appliances are
generally easily adopted and accessed through mobile phones or tablets via Apps. Users can easily manage multiple smart home appliances
in just one device by their fingertip in the App: the status of all the appliances connected such as power levels, power consumed, air
pollution, and room humidity will be displayed on their screen. Moreover, users will be able to control and manage every single appliance
in large size homes with multiple floors by using the smart home ecosystem without the need access each individual appliance.
We established an IoT Technology
and Lifestyle product team during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and are in the process of developing a series of IoT home automation
products. We expect to initially distribute the IoT products in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia and hope to expand to other countries as
opportunities permit.
Use of Capital Funds
On June 21, 2022, the Company
has entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with Williamsburg Venture Holdings, LLC (“Investor”), a Nevada venture capital
company, pursuant to which the Investor has committed to invest up to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) in the Company’s common
stock over a 36-month period. In light of the Company’s latest strategic plan to tackle the Smart Home segment with products enhanced
with Healthcare, Lifestyles, and Mobility elements, the Company will use the proceeds to establish a sustainable smart home ecosystem
through in-house development of smart home appliances, target acquisition of smart home sector companies, and establish strategic partnerships
with ESG promote companies.
Research and Development
During the quarter ended December
31, 2022, our research and development expenses are mainly incurred for the maintenance cost of our product development team. We expect
to allocate our research and development funding towards product innovation of smart home appliances, and the recruitment of product development
talents.
Sales and Marketing
We believe the demand for
smart home appliances will continue to increase especially as the technological improvements such as AI are integrated into products to
enhance user experience. We expect to distribute our current and future power supply and IoT products as follows:
·
Hong Kong – through our e-commerce channels, and leverage on our networks to distribute to prominent retailers, collaborate distribution channels with sales solution and promotion campaign.
·
APAC – through third party authorized dealers and channel partners.
·
USA/EMEA – through third party authorized distributors (which we expect to be wholesalers that sell to end retailers).
Recently, we signed an arrangement
with local retail chain store to sell our brands. We believe this arrangement will enhance market recognition of our brand. In the near
future, we intend to enhance our sales channels in Hong Kong and other regions.

Going Concern
Our continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital
may include the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions, capital leases and short-term and
long-term debts. While we believe that we will obtain external financing and the existing shareholders will continue to provide the additional
cash to meet our obligations as they become due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources
on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations
for at least the next 12 months.
Material Cash Requirements
We have not achieved profitability
since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect net cash expended in 2023 to
be significantly higher than 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $7,528,487. Our material cash requirements
are highly dependent upon the additional financial support from our major shareholders in the next 12 - 18 months.

Controls and
Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), under the supervision of and with
the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures,
subject to limitations as noted below, as of December 31, 2022, and during the period prior to and including the date of this report,
were effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rule and forms;
and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Inherent Limitations
Because of its inherent limitations,
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
