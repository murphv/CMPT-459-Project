Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and its subsidiaries, including less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in which AmerisourceBergen Corporation has a controlling financial interest (the "Company"), as of the dates and for the periods indicated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals, except as otherwise disclosed herein) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position as of December 31, 2022 and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been included. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but which are not required for interim reporting purposes, have been omitted. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimated amounts. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation. Restricted Cash The Company is required to maintain certain cash deposits with banks mainly consisting of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations, including opioid-related legal settlements. The following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash used in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: (amounts in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 September 30,

Variable Interest Entity The Company has substantial governance rights over Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmacêuticos S.A. ("Profarma"), which allow it to direct the activities that significantly impact Profarma’s economic performance. As such, the Company consolidates the operating results of Profarma in its consolidated financial statements. The Company is not obligated to provide future financial support to Profarma.
The following assets and liabilities of Profarma are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,002   $ 23,144   Accounts receivables, net 216,759   192,930   Inventories 198,851   207,858   Prepaid expenses and other 63,316   63,982   Property and equipment, net 37,925   35,554   Other intangible assets 65,504   66,568   Other long-term assets 72,531   71,327   Total assets $ 667,888   $ 661,363   Accounts payable $ 220,568   $ 215,515   Accrued expenses and other 44,161   47,952   Short-term debt 44,151   60,851   Long-term debt 87,532   64,918   Deferred income taxes 25,591   25,801   Other long-term liabilities 52,414   52,417   Total liabilities $ 474,417   $ 467,454   Profarma's assets can only be used to settle its obligations, and its creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.
Note 3.
Income Taxes The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, and various foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in the Company’s financial statements, of $ 553.5
million ($ 481.5
million, net of federal benefit). If recognized, $ 463.3
million of these tax benefits would have reduced income tax expense and the effective tax rate. Included in this amount is $ 22.9
million of interest and penalties, which the Company records in Income Tax Expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 0.3
million. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that tax authority audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 19.3
million. The Company's effective tax rates were
19.8 % and
24.6 % for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, offset in part by U.S. state income taxes. The effective tax rate in the three months ended December 31, 2021 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to U.S. state income taxes as well as discrete tax expense associated with foreign valuation allowance adjustments. 8 Note 4.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill, by reportable segment, for the three months ended December 31, 2022: (in thousands) U.

Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 72.4
million and $ 80.3
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets is estimated to be $ 287.3

basis points over SOFR/EURIBOR/CDOR/RFR as of December 31, 2022) and from
0
basis points to
22.5
basis points over the alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable. The Company pays facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on its debt rating, ranging from
7
basis points to
15
basis points, annually, of the total commitment ( 10
basis points as of December 31, 2022). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which the Company was compliant as of December 31, 2022. Commercial Paper Program     The Company has a commercial paper program whereby it may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $ 2.4
billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed
365
days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase the Company’s borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by the Company’s Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were
no
borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of December 31, 2022. Receivables Securitization Facility The Company has a $ 1,450
million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which is scheduled to expire in October 2025. The Company has available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $ 250
million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or
10 30-day Term SOFR, plus a program fee. The Company pays a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which the Company was compliant as of December 31, 2022. Revolving Credit Note, Overdraft Facility, and Money Market Facility     The Company has an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to it pursuant to a revolving credit note ("Revolving Credit Note"). The Revolving Credit Note provides the Company with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $ 75
million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or the Company at any time without prior notice. The Company also has a £ 10
million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility ("Overdraft Facility"), which expires in February 2024, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to its MWI Animal Health business. The Company has an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to it pursuant to a money market credit agreement ("Money Market Facility"). The Money Market Facility provides the Company with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $ 100
million. The Money Market Facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or the Company at any time without prior notice.
Alliance Healthcare Debt Alliance Healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates. A majority of the outstanding borrowings were held in Egypt (which is
50 % owned) as of December 31, 2022. These facilities are used to fund its working capital needs. Nonrecourse Debt Nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiary and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiary's cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiary. Note 6.
Stockholders’ Equity and Earnings per Share In May 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing the Company to purchase up to $ 1.0
billion of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased
5.0
million shares of its common stock for a total of $ 778.8
million, including
4.4  million shares from Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ("WBA") for $ 700  million. These purchases excluded $ 28.4  million of purchases in September 2022 that cash settled in October 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 182.5  million of availability remaining under this program.     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to AmerisourceBergen Corporation by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to AmerisourceBergen Corporation by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units during the periods presented.      The following illustrates the components of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the periods indicated: Three months ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 204,032   208,555   Dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units 2,295   2,613   Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 206,327   211,168   The potentially dilutive stock options and restricted stock units that were antidilutive for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
0.4
million . Note 7.
Related Party Transactions WBA owns more than
10 % of the Company’s outstanding common stock and is, therefore, considered a related party. The Company operates under various agreements and arrangements with WBA, including a pharmaceutical distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company distributes pharmaceutical products to WBA and an agreement that provides the Company the ability to access favorable economic pricing and generic products through a generic purchasing services
11 arrangement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (both through 2029) as well as a distribution agreement pursuant to which it supplies branded and generic pharmaceutical products to WBA’s Boots UK Ltd. subsidiary (through 2031).
Revenue from the various agreements and arrangements with WBA was $ 16.2
billion in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company’s receivable from WBA, net of incentives, was $ 6.7
billion and $ 7.0
billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Note 8.
Acquisition, Integration, and Restructuring Expenses      The following illustrates the expenses incurred by the Company relating to Acquisition, Integration, and Restructuring Expenses for the periods indicated: Three months ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Acquisition-related deal and integration $ 20,996   $ 21,350   Employee severance 716   343   Business transformation efforts 12,920   4,342   Other restructuring initiatives 2,604   6,299       Total acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses $ 37,236   $ 32,334   Acquisition-related deal and integration expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily related to costs associated with the integration of Alliance Healthcare.
Business transformation efforts in the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to costs associated with the Company's name change (see Note 13). Business transformation efforts in the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to costs associated with reorganizing the Company to further align the organization to its customers' needs. The majority of these costs related to services provided by third-party consultants, including certain technology initiatives. Note 9.
Legal Matters and Contingencies In the ordinary course of its business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought from the Company in some matters, and some matters may require years for the Company to resolve. The Company records a reserve for these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For those matters for which the Company has not recognized a liability, the Company cannot predict the outcome of their impact on the Company as uncertainty remains with regard to whether such matters will proceed to trial, whether settlements will be reached, and the amount and terms of any such settlements. Outcomes may include settlements in significant amounts that are not currently estimable, limitations on the Company ’ s conduct, the imposition of corporate integrity agreement obligations, consent decrees, and/or other civil and criminal penalties. From time to time, the Company is also involved in disputes with its customers, which the Company generally seeks to resolve through commercial negotiations. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties may litigate the dispute or otherwise attempt to settle the matter. With respect to the specific legal proceedings and claims described below, unless otherwise noted, the amount or range of possible losses is not reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the settlement, resolution, or other outcome of one or more matters, including the matters set forth below, during any subsequent reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s results of operations or cash flows for that period or on the Company's financial condition. Opioid Lawsuits and Investigations A significant number of counties, municipalities, and other governmental entities in a majority of U.S. states and Puerto Rico, as well as numerous states and tribes, filed lawsuits in various federal, state and other courts against pharmaceutical wholesale distributors (including the Company and certain subsidiaries, such as AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”) and H.D. Smith), pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains, medical practices, and physicians relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications.
An initial group of cases was consolidated for Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL”) proceedings before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (the “Court”) in December 2017. In April 2018, the Court issued an order creating a litigation track, which included dispositive motion practice, discovery, and trials in certain bellwether jurisdictions. In
12 November 2019 and January 2020, the Court filed Suggestions of Remand with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation that identified
four
cases filed against the Company for potential transfer from the MDL back to federal courts in California, Oklahoma, and West Virginia for the completion of discovery, motion practice, and trial. All
four
cases were remanded to those federal district courts. Trial in the two consolidated cases in West Virginia commenced in May 2021 and concluded in July 2021. On July 4, 2022, the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants, including the Company. The plaintiffs filed an appeal of the court’s decision on August 2, 2022. The Oklahoma case, in which the plaintiff was the Cherokee Nation, was resolved through a settlement with the Cherokee Nation, as announced on September 28, 2021.
The California case, in which the plaintiff was the City and County of San Francisco, was resolved pursuant to the comprehensive settlement described below (the “Distributor Settlement Agreement”), and all claims against the Company have been dismissed in both cases. On July 21, 2021, the Company announced that it and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a
Distributor Settlement Agreement
that, if all conditions were satisfied, would result in the resolution of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities.
The
Distributor Settlement Agreement
became effective on April 2, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, it included
48
of 49 eligible states (the "Settling States"), as well as
99 %
by
population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Pursuant to the
Distributor Settlement Agreement
and related agreements with Settling States, the Company will pay up to approximately $ 6.4  billion over
18
years and comply with other requirements, including establishment of a clearinghouse that will consolidate data from all three national distributors. The exact payment amount will depend on several factors, including the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by subdivisions (e.g., laws barring opioid lawsuits by subdivisions). West Virginia and its subdivisions and Native American tribes are not a part of the
Distributor Settlement Agreement
and the Company has reached separate agreements with these groups. On July 22, 2022, the State of Alabama sought and was subsequently granted leave to amend its complaint in a pending state court action against another distributor in order to add the Company as a party.
The amended Complaint was filed on July 25, 2022. The trial in the Alabama state court is currently anticipated to begin in February 2024. The Company’s accrued litigation liability related to the Distributor Settlement Agreement, including an estimate for the State of Alabama (with whom the Company has not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which it has reached settlement agreements, as described above, was $ 5.9
billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 6.0
billion as of September 30, 2022. The Company currently estimates that $ 471.8
million will be paid prior to December 31, 2023, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining long-term liability of $ 5.5
billion
is recorded in Accrued Litigation Liability on the Company ’ s Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the Company has accrued its estimated liability for opioid litigation, it is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with the matters that are not included in the accrual. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews opioid litigation matters to determine whether its accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued to date.
Until such time as otherwise resolved, the Company will continue to litigate and prepare for trial and to vigorously defend itself in all such matters.
Since these matters are still developing, the Company is unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect the Company ’ s operations.
Other lawsuits regarding the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications have been filed by: third-party payors and similar entities; hospitals; hospital groups; and individuals, including cases styled as putative class actions. These lawsuits, which have been and continue to be filed in federal, state, and other courts, generally allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes as well as common law claims, including negligence, public nuisance, and unjust enrichment, and seek equitable relief and monetary damages. Motion practice and active discovery are ongoing in many of these cases.
In Alabama, discovery is proceeding for a jury trial scheduled to begin in July 2023 that will include up to eight plaintiff hospitals. The Company, as well as additional pharmaceutical distributors and manufacturers, will be defendants in the July trial. Ongoing and additional litigation is anticipated in cases filed by subdivisions that are not participating in the
Distributor Settlement Agreement , as well as in cases filed by non-governmental or non-political entities, including hospitals, third-party payors, and individuals, among others. Certain cases related to opioids filed in various state courts have trial dates scheduled after July 2023, although all such dates are subject to change. The Company is vigorously defending itself in the pending lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend itself against any threatened lawsuits or enforcement proceedings. Since July 2017, the Company has received subpoenas from several U.S. Attorney ’ s Offices, including grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the District of New Jersey ( “ USAO-NJ”) and the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the Eastern District of New York ( “ USAO-EDNY”). Those subpoenas requested the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to the Company ’ s distribution of controlled substances through its various subsidiaries, including ABDC, and its diversion control programs. The Company produced documents in response to the subpoenas and engaged in discussions with the various U.S. Attorney’s Offices, including the Health Care and Government Fraud Unit of the Criminal Division of the
13 USAO-NJ, the U.S. Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in an attempt to resolve these matters. On December 29, 2022, the Department of Justice filed a civil Complaint against
the Company, ABDC , and Integrated Commercialization Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Company negligently failed to report suspicious orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration. In the Complaint, the Department of Justice seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief. This Complaint relates to the aforementioned and previously-disclosed investigations. The Company denies the allegations in the Complaint and intends to defend itself vigorously in the litigation. Shareholder Securities Litigation On October 11, 2019, Teamsters Local 443 Health Services & Insurance Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Pension Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Workers Supplemental Pension Plan (2014 Restatement), Retirement Medical Funding Plan for the St. Paul Electrical Workers, and San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors (collectively,
“ Defendants”). The complaint alleges that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to oversee the compliance by certain of the Company ’ s subsidiaries (including the Company ’ s former subsidiary Medical Initiatives, Inc. ( “ MII”)) with federal regulations, allegedly resulting in the payment of fines and penalties in connection with the settlements with the USAO-EDNY in fiscal 2017 and 2018 that resolved claims arising from MII ’ s pre-filled syringe program. In December 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After briefing and oral argument, on August 24, 2020 the Delaware Court of Chancery denied Defendants ’
motion to dismiss. On September 24, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company established a Special Litigation Committee to conduct an investigation concerning the plaintiffs’ allegations, and on November 10, 2020, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the Special Litigation Committee’s motion to stay the litigation pending its investigation. On September 22, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed its report under seal and moved to dismiss the case. The Special Litigation Committee’s motion to dismiss the case is pending. On December 30, 2021, Lebanon County Employees ’
Retirement Fund and Teamsters Local 443 Health Services & Insurance Plan filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current officers and directors. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty allegedly arising from
the Board’s and certain officers’ oversight of
the Company’s controlled substance diversion control programs. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on March 29, 2022. On December 22, 2022, the Court of Chancery granted the motion to dismiss. On January 9, 2023, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment and Order Pursuant to Rule 60(b) from the Chancery Court ’ s judgment.
On January 20, 2023, the Plaintiffs also appealed the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Subpoenas, Ongoing Investigations, and Other Contingencies From time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to the Company ’ s business or to the business of a customer, supplier, or other industry participant. The Company ’ s responses often require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred. Most of these matters are resolved without incident; however, such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the healthcare industry, as well as to substantial settlements. In January 2017, U.S. Bioservices Corporation (“U.S. Bio”), a former subsidiary of the Company, received a subpoena for information from the USAO-EDNY relating to its activities in connection with billing for products and making returns of potential overpayments to government payers. A filed qui tam complaint related to the investigation was unsealed in April 2019 and the relator filed an amended complaint under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In December 2019, the government filed a notice that it was declining to intervene. The court ordered that the relator ’ s complaint against the Company and other defendants, including AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, LLC, be unsealed. The relator’s complaint alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and the false claims acts of various states. The relator filed a second amended complaint, removing one state false claims act count. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint and all briefs on the motion were filed with the court on October 9, 2020. The motion to dismiss was granted on December 22, 2022. The False Claims Act claims were dismissed with prejudice, and the state claims were dismissed without prejudice.
On January 24, 2023, the relator filed Motions to Reconsider Dismissal and For Leave to Amend the Complaint. In December 2019, Reliable Pharmacy, together with other retail pharmacies and North Sunflower Medical Center, filed a civil antitrust complaint against multiple generic drug manufacturers, and also included claims against ABDC and H.D. Smith, and other drug distributors and industry participants. The case is filed as a putative class action and plaintiffs purport to represent a class of drug purchasers including other retail pharmacies and healthcare providers. The case has been consolidated for multidistrict litigation proceedings before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that ABDC, H.D. Smith, and others in the industry participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, allocate markets
14 and rig bids regarding generic drugs. In March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint. On July 15, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On May 25, 2022, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice. On July 1, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, again including claims against the Company and other drug distributors and industry participants. On August 21, 2022, the Company and other industry participants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. All briefs on the motion were filed with the court on November 22, 2022. On March 3, 2022, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia notified the Company of the existence of a criminal investigation into MWI Veterinary Supply Co., the Company’s animal health subsidiary, in connection with grand jury subpoenas to which MWI previously responded relating to compliance with state and federal regulatory requirements governing wholesale shipments of animal health products to customers in certain states. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. Note 10.
Litigation Settlements Antitrust Settlements Numerous lawsuits have been filed against certain brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. These lawsuits are generally brought as class actions. The Company is not typically named as a plaintiff in these lawsuits, but has been a member of the direct purchasers' class (i.e., those purchasers who purchase directly from these pharmaceutical manufacturers). None of the lawsuits have gone to trial, but some have settled in the past with the Company receiving proceeds from the settlement funds. The Company recognized gains related to these lawsuits of $ 49.9
million the three months ended December 31, 2022. These gains, which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 11.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The recorded amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 approximate fair value based upon the relatively short-term nature of these financial instruments. Within Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Company had
no
investments in money market accounts as of December 31, 2022 due to the prefunding of the PharmaLex acquisition (see Note 13) and had $ 1,602.0
million of investments in money market accounts as of September 30, 2022. The fair value of the money market accounts was determined based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, otherwise known as Level 1 inputs. The recorded amount of long-term debt (see Note 5) and the corresponding fair value as of December 31, 2022 were $ 4,656.0
million and $ 4,194.0
million, respectively. The recorded amount of long-term debt and the corresponding fair value as of September 30, 2022 were $ 4,632.4
million and $ 4,130.3
million, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt was determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices, otherwise known as Level 2 inputs. Note 12.
Business Segment Information     The Company is organized geographically based upon the products and services it provides to its customers and reports its results under
two
reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions.

All corporate office expenses are allocated to the operating segment level. 16 Note 13.
Subsequent Events PharmaLex Acquisition The Company acquired and assumed control of PharmaLex Holding Gmbh ("PharmaLex") effective January 1, 2023 for € 1.381  billion, subject to customary adjustments, including a € 27.5  million cash holdback. Subsequent to the signing of the definitive agreement in September 2022 to acquire PharmaLex for € 1.28  billion, PharmaLex completed other acquisitions that the Company had agreed to, and, as a result, the Company paid an incremental € 101  million at transaction closing. Due to the timing of the acquisition and federal holidays, the Company prefunded $ 1.438  billion for the acquisition on December 29, 2022, which resulted in a prepaid asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry. PharmaLex's services include regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance. PharmaLex is headquartered in Germany and operates in over
30
countries. The acquisition will advance the Company's role as a partner of choice for biopharmaceutical partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey. PharmaLex will be a component of the Company's International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment.
The purchase price has not yet been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation is pending third-party appraisals of intangible assets and the corresponding deferred taxes, as well as other asset and liability account balances. Company Name Change On January 24, 2023, the Company announced its intent to change its name to better reflect its bold vision and purpose-driven approach to creating healthier futures. The Company intends to begin operating as Cencora in the second half of calendar year 2023. The new name represents a unified presence that will continue to fuel the Company’s ongoing growth strategy and advance its impact across healthcare. In connection with the name change, the useful lives of certain trade names will be shortened, which will result in additional acquisition-related intangibles amortization expense over the next few years. 17 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are forward-looking and as such are not historical facts.

We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. We are organized geographically based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, and we report our results under two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions.
U.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. International Healthcare Solutions Segment The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It also is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain.      20 Table of Contents Recent Developments PharmaLex Acquisition We acquired and assumed control of PharmaLex Holding Gmbh ("PharmaLex") effective January 1, 2023 for €1.381 billion, subject to customary adjustments, including a €27.5 million cash holdback. Subsequent to the signing of the definitive agreement in September 2022 to acquire PharmaLex for €1.28 billion, PharmaLex completed other acquisitions that we had agreed to, and, as a result, we paid an incremental €101 million at transaction closing. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry. PharmaLex's services include regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance. PharmaLex is headquartered in Germany and operates in over 30 countries. The acquisition will advance our role as a partner of choice for biopharmaceutical partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey. PharmaLex will be a component of our International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment.
Company Name Change On January 24, 2023, we announced our intent to change our name to better reflect our bold vision and purpose-driven approach to creating healthier futures. We intend to begin operating as Cencora in the second half of calendar year 2023. The new name represents a unified presence that will continue to fuel our ongoing growth strategy and advance our impact across healthcare. In connection with the name change, the useful lives of certain trade names will be shortened, which will result in additional acquisition-related intangibles amortization expense over the next few years. Executive Summary     This executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow:
• Revenue increased by $3.2 billion, or 5.4%, from the prior year quarter due to growth in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue by $3.3 billion, or 6.1%, from the prior quarter primarily due to overall market growth driven by unit volume growth and increased sales to specialty physician practices, offset in part by a decline in sales of COVID-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments). Revenue in International Healthcare Solutions decreased $38.5 million from the prior year quarter due to a decline at Alliance Healthcare, our European distribution business, resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter and the June 2022 divestiture of our Brazil specialty business, offset in part by increases in sales in our less-than-wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business, our Canada operations, and our global specialty logistics business; • Gross profit increased by $85.6 million, or 4.2%, from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the current year quarter was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit in U.S. Healthcare Solutions and gains from antitrust litigation settlements. The increase was offset in part by last-in, first-out ("LIFO") expense in the current year quarter in comparison to a LIFO credit in the prior year quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions gross profit increased by $107.6 million, or 8.4%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to increased sales and a 5-basis point improvement in gross profit margin. Gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased by $1.4 million, or 0.2%, from prior year quarter primarily due to our less-than-wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business and our global specialty logistics business, and was largely offset by a decrease in our European distribution business resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter and the June 2022 divestiture of our Brazil specialty business; • Total operating expenses increased by $96.9 million, or 6.8%, compared to the prior year quarter primarily as a result of an increase in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses, offset in part by lower litigation and opioid-related expenses in the current year quarter; • Total segment operating income decreased by $15.4 million, or 2.1%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in operating income in the International Healthcare Solutions segment resulting from
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter; and • Our effective tax rates were 19.8% and 24.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, offset in part by U.S. state income taxes. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenue Three months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions: Human Health $ 55,076,613  $ 51,782,129  6.4% Animal Health 1,159,966  1,197,518  (3.1)% Total U.S. Healthcare Solutions 56,236,579  52,979,647  6.1% International Healthcare Solutions: Alliance Healthcare 5,460,691  5,556,671  (1.7)% Other Healthcare Solutions 1,150,587  1,093,111  5.3% Total International Healthcare Solutions 6,611,278  6,649,782  (0.6)% Intersegment eliminations (1,025) (619) Revenue $ 62,846,832  $ 59,628,810  5.4% Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the United States and Europe, currency exchange rates, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, changes in government rules and regulations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue increased by 5.4% from the prior year quarter due to growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue by $3.3 billion, or 6.1%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to overall market growth driven by unit volume growth and increased sales to specialty physician practices, offset in part by a decline in sales of COVID-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments). More specifically, the increase in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was largely attributable to the following (in billions): Increased sales to specialty physician practices $0.8 Decreased sales of COVID-19 treatments $(0.3) Increased sales to other customers $2.8 The International Healthcare Solutions' revenue decreased by $38.5 million, or 0.6%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to a decline at Alliance Healthcare, our European distribution business, resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter and the June 2022 divestiture of our Brazil specialty business, offset in part by increases in sales in our less-than-wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business, our Canada operations, and our global specialty logistics business. A number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. 22 Table of Contents Gross Profit Three months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions $ 1,386,148  $ 1,278,553  8.4% International Healthcare Solutions 738,540  737,127  0.2% Gains from antitrust litigation settlements 49,899  —  LIFO (expense) credit (25,050) 44,679  Turkey highly inflationary impact (3,584) —  Gross profit $ 2,145,953  $ 2,060,359  4.2%     Gross profit increased by $85.6 million, or 4.2%, from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the current year quarter was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit in U.S. Healthcare Solutions and gains from antitrust litigation settlements. The increase was offset in part by LIFO expense in the current year quarter in comparison to a LIFO credit in the prior year quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions gross profit increased by $107.6 million, or 8.4%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to increased sales and a 5-basis point improvement in gross profit margin to 2.46% in the current year quarter from 2.41% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased by $1.4 million, or 0.2%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to our less-than-wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business and our global specialty logistics business, and was largely offset by a decrease in our European distribution business resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter and the June 2022 divestiture of our Brazil specialty business. We recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $49.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The gains were recorded as reductions to Cost of Goods Sold (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our cost of goods sold for interim periods includes a LIFO provision that is recorded ratably on a quarterly basis and is based on our estimated annual LIFO provision. The annual LIFO provision, which we estimate on a quarterly basis, is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, expected changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact on our annual LIFO provision. The $25.1 million LIFO expense in the current year quarter is primarily due to higher brand pharmaceutical inflation and inventory product mix, offset in part by greater generic pharmaceutical deflation. Operating Expenses Three months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Distribution, selling, and administrative $ 1,290,928  $ 1,170,110  10.3% Depreciation and amortization 171,940  175,929  (2.3)% Litigation and opioid-related expenses 12,706  32,635  Acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses 37,236  32,334  Impairment of assets —  4,946  Total operating expenses $ 1,512,810  $ 1,415,954  6.8% Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $120.8 million, or 10.3%, compared to prior year quarter primarily to support revenue growth in U.S. Healthcare Solutions and included inflationary impacts on certain operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 2.05% in the current year quarter and represented a 9-basis point increase compared to the prior year quarter. Depreciation expense increased 4.1% from the prior year quarter. Amortization expense decreased 9.9% from the prior year quarter primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter. 23 Table of Contents Litigation and opioid-related expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022 included legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations. Litigation and opioid-related expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2021 included a $6.8 million accrual related to opioid litigation settlements and $25.8 million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations. Acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022 included $21.0 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs primarily related to the integration of Alliance Healthcare, $12.9 million related to our business transformation efforts, and $3.3 million of other restructuring initiatives and severance. Acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2021 included $21.4 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs primarily related to the integration of Alliance Healthcare, $6.6 million of other restructuring initiatives and severance, and $4.3 million related to our business transformation efforts.

U.S. Healthcare Solutions' operating income increased by $3.3 million, or 0.6%, from prior year quarter primarily due to the increase in gross profit, as noted above, and was largely offset in part by the increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, U.S. Healthcare Solutions' operating income margin was 1.02% in the current year quarter ended and represented a decline of 5 basis points compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the increase in operating expenses. Operating income in International Healthcare Solutions decreased by $18.8 million, or 10.4%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to a decrease in operating income in our European distribution business resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the current year quarter in comparison to the prior year quarter and the June 2022 divestiture of our Brazil specialty business. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:   2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Interest expense $ 60,806  3.21% $ 56,632  2.58% Interest income (14,790) 2.86% (3,260) 0.88% Interest expense, net $ 46,016    $ 53,372    Interest expense, net decreased by $7.4 million, or 13.8%, from the prior year quarter primarily due to the increase in interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher investment interest rates and higher average
24 Table of Contents investment cash balances in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in interest income was offset in part by an increase in interest expense that was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates associated with our domestic variable-rate debt. Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rates were 19.8% and 24.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, offset in part by U.S. state income taxes. The effective tax rate in the three months ended December 31, 2021 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to U.S. state income taxes as well as discrete tax expense associated with foreign valuation allowance adjustments. Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and purchases of shares of our common stock. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund the payment of dividends, fund purchases of our common stock, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including the opioid litigation payments that will be made over 18 years (see below). Cash Flows As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $830.6 million and $688.4 million, respectively. We have the ability to repatriate the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional taxes upon repatriation. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. The largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1,315.0 million and $266.4 million, respectively. We had $1,558.1 million and $710.8 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, our operating activities provided cash of $710.1 million in comparison to $863.4 million in the prior year quarter. Cash provided by operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was principally the result of the following: • An increase in accounts payable of $1,381.1 million primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; • Net income of $476.2 million; and • Positive non-cash items of $242.9 million, which is primarily comprised of depreciation expense of $100.3 million and amortization expense of $75.1 million. The cash provided by the above items was offset in part by the following: • An increase in inventories of $1,178.0 million to support the increase in business volume and due to seasonal needs; and • A decrease in accrued expenses of $233.6 million primarily due to the payment of accrual liabilities that were on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022. Cash provided by operations during the three months ended December 31, 2021 was principally the result of the following: • An increase in accounts payable of $824.1 million primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; • A decrease in accounts receivable of $716.4 million primarily due to the timing of scheduled payments from our customers, offset in part by an increase in sales; 25 Table of Contents • Net income of $449.4 million; and • Positive non-cash items of $221.7 million, which is primarily comprised of depreciation expense of $96.9 million and amortization expense of $83.5 million. The cash provided by the above items was offset in part by the following: • An increase in inventories of $990.0 million to support the increase in business volume and due to seasonal needs; and • A decrease in accrued expenses of $314.7 million primarily due to the payment of accrual liabilities that were on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021. We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week on which the month ends.   Three months ended December 31,   2022 2021 Days sales outstanding 27.5 28.1 Days inventory on hand 27.4 28.2 Days payable outstanding 59.4 59.2 Our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period-end working capital account balances. Additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows during the three months ended December 31, 2022 included $63.1 million of interest payments and $30.3 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during the three months ended December 31, 2021 included $51.9 million of interest payments and $43.7 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $75.7 million and $79.7 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included investments in various technology initiatives, including technology investments at Alliance Healthcare.
We currently expect to invest approximately $500 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023. Larger 2023 capital expenditures will include investments relating to various technology initiatives, including technology investments at Alliance Healthcare and those needed to comply with new regulatory requirements. In addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activity in the three months ended December 31, 2022 included $1,438.1 million for the prefunding of our acquisition of PharmaLex (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Net cash used in financing activities in the three months ended December 31, 2022 principally resulted from $807.2 million in purchases of our common stock and $99.7 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities in the three months ended December 31, 2021 principally resulted from $100.5 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.

We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 15.0 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points as of December 31, 2022). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of December 31, 2022. We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $2.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2022. We have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which is scheduled to expire in October 2025. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or 30-day Term SOFT plus a program fee. We pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we were compliant as of December 31, 2022. We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("Revolving Credit Note"). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans
27 Table of Contents from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. We also have a £10 million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility ("Overdraft Facility"), which expires in February 2024, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our MWI Animal Health business. We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a money market credit agreement ("Money Market Facility"). The Money Market Facility provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $100 million. The Money Market Facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice.
Alliance Healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates. A majority of the outstanding borrowings were held in Egypt (which is 50% owned) as of December 31, 2022. These facilities are used to fund its working capital needs. Nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiary and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiary' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiary. Share Purchase Programs and Dividends In May 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we purchased $778.8 million of our common stock, including $700 million from Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. These purchases excluded $28.4 million of purchases in September 2022 that cash settled in October 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had $182.5 million of availability remaining under this program. In November 2022, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend paid on common stock by 5% from $0.460 per share to $0.485 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remains within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. Commitments and Obligations As discussed and defined in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 21, 2021, it was announced that we and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a Distributor Settlement Agreement. The Distributor Settlement Agreement became effective on April 2, 2022, and as of December 31 2022, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the “Settling States”) as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Pursuant to the Distributor Settlement Agreement and related agreements with Settling States, we will pay up to approximately $6.4 billion over 18 years. Our estimated liability related to the State of Alabama (with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which we have reached settlement agreements is approximately $0.4 billion. We have a $5.9 billion liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 for litigation relating to our comprehensive opioid settlement as well as other opioid-related litigation. The payment of the aforementioned litigation liability has not and is not expected to have an impact on our ability to pay dividends. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of December 31, 2022: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Debt, Including Interest Payments Operating

We expect to pay $157.1 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, related to the transition tax as of December 31, 2022, which is payable in installments over a six-year period, and commenced in January 2021. The transition tax commitment is included in "Other Commitments" in the above table. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $553.5 million (including interest and penalties) as of December 31, 2022. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. Our liability for
28 Table of Contents uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risks We have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the U.K. Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Turkish Lira, the Egyptian Pound, the Brazilian Real, and the Canadian Dollar. We use forward contracts to hedge against the foreign currency exchange rate impact on certain intercompany receivable and payable balances. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. Revenue from our foreign operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue. We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We had $696.5 million of variable-rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect as of December 31, 2022. We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $1,692.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10-basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million. Deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations. Recent elevated levels of inflation in the global and U.S. economies have impacted certain operating expenses. If elevated levels of inflation persist or increase, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected, particularly in certain global markets. We have risks from other geopolitical trends and events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict has not been material. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company’s most significant market risks are the effects of foreign currency risk, changing interest rates, and changes in the price and volatility of the Company’s common stock. See the discussion under the heading "Market Risks," which is incorporated by reference herein.
