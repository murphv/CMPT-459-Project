NOTE 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements of Pro-Dex, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Pro-Dex,” or the
“Company”) have been prepared in accordance with
accounting
principles generally
accepted
in
the
United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
for
interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly,
they
do
not include all of the information and footnotes required
by
U.S.
GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements presented
in our Annual Report
on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments considered necessary for
a
fair presentation have been included.
The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2022.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which introduces a forward-looking
approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to
understand the entity’s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024 for the Company) with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this ASU
and its potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
There
are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our
financial statements.
NOTE 2.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We specialize in the design, development
and manufacture of autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers used primarily in the orthopedic,
thoracic, and maxocranial facial markets. We have patented adaptive torque-limiting software and proprietary sealing solutions which
appeal to our customers, primarily medical device distributors. We also manufacture and sell rotary air motors to a wide range of industries.
In August 2020, we formed a wholly
owned subsidiary, PDEX Franklin, LLC (“PDEX Franklin”), to hold title for an approximate 25,000 square foot industrial building
in Tustin, California (the “Franklin Property”) that we acquired on November 6, 2020, in order to allow for the continued
growth of our business. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and PDEX Franklin and all
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. This subsidiary has no separate operations.

The timing of revenue recognition,
billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivables, unbilled receivables (presented as deferred costs on our condensed
consolidated balance sheets) and customer advances and deposits (presented as deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheets),
where applicable. Amounts are generally billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed upon milestones. The over-time revenue recognition
model consists of non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) and prototype services and typically relates to NRE services related to
the evaluation, design or customization of a medical device and is typically recognized over time utilizing an input measure of progress
based on costs incurred compared to the estimated total costs upon completion. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022,
we recorded $ 312,000
and $ 862,000 , respectively, of revenue that had been included in deferred revenue in the prior year. During the three
and six months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $ 98,000
of revenue that had been included in deferred revenue in the prior year. The
revenue recognized from the contract liabilities consisted of satisfying our performance obligations during the normal course of business.
Our entire deferred revenue balance of $ 851,000
at December 31, 2022, is currently expected to be recognized in the next 12 months.

and $ 755,000 , respectively, represent an investment
in the common stock of Air T, Inc. Two of our Board members are also board members of Air T, Inc. and both either individually or through
affiliates own an equity interest in Air T, Inc. Our Chairman, one of the two Board members aforementioned, also serves as the Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of Air T, Inc. Another of our Board members is employed by Air T, Inc. as its Chief of Staff. The shares were purchased
through 10b5-1 Plans, that, in accordance with our internal policies regarding the approval of related-party transactions, were approved
by our then three Board members that are not affiliated with Air T, Inc.

Raymond Cabillot and Nicholas Swenson, who chairs the committee. Both Mr. Cabillot and Mr. Swenson are active investors with extensive
portfolio management expertise. We leverage the experience of these committee members to make investment decisions for the investment
of our surplus operating capital or borrowed funds. Additionally, many of our securities holdings include stocks of public companies that
either Messrs. Swenson or Cabillot or both may own from time to time either individually or through the investment funds that they manage,

the build-out of the property in the first quarter of the fiscal 2022. Currently, we are actively engaged in various verification and
validation activities and we moved certain employees into the new building during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect that we

Patent-related
costs consist of legal fees incurred in connection with both patent applications and a patent issuance and will be amortized over the
estimated life of the product(s) that is or will be utilizing the technology, or expensed immediately in the event the patent office denies
the issuance of the patent. Future amortization expense is expected to be $ 21,000
for the remainder of fiscal 2023 and $ 42,000
per fiscal
year through October 2025, at which time we expect these costs to be fully amortized. During the three months ended December 31, 2021,
we impaired $ 46,000
in previously capitalized legal fees because although we were granted the underlying patent, in this case, we had
(and continue to have) no products either in development or sold that utilize the intellectual property protected by the patent.

WARRANTY
The
warranty accrual is based on historical costs of warranty repairs and expected future identifiable warranty expenses and is included in
accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the warranty reserve
amounted to $ 344,000
and $ 340,000 , respectively. Warranty expenses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of income. Changes in estimates to previously established warranty accruals result from current period updates to assumptions
regarding repair costs and warranty return rates and are included in current period warranty expense. Warranty expense relating to new
product sales and changes to estimates for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 56,000
and $ 44,000 , respectively, and
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 123,000

NET INCOME PER SHARE
We calculate basic net income per
share by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding reflects the effects of potentially dilutive securities, in income generating periods, which consist
entirely of outstanding stock options and performance awards.
The following table presents reconciliations
of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for net income. In the tables below, net income
amounts represent the numerator, and weighted average shares outstanding amounts represent the denominator (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

NOTE 7.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred
income taxes are provided on
a
liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for
temporary
differences. Temporary
differences are the differences between the reported amounts
of
assets and liabilities and
their tax basis. Deferred
tax
assets are reduced by
a
valuation
allowance when, in the opinion
of
management, it is more - likely - than - not
that some portion or
all of the
deferred tax assets will not
be
realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
of
changes in tax laws and
rates
on
the date of enactment.
Significant
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability
of
our
deferred tax assets. Such determination is based primarily on our historical taxable income, with some consideration given
to
our
estimates
of
future taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over
which our deferred tax assets would be
recoverable.
We recognize accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
when applicable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we recognized accrued interest of $ 54,000
and $ 61,000 , respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits.
We are subject to U.S. federal income
tax, as well as income tax of multiple state tax jurisdictions. We are currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the
Internal Revenue Service for the years ended June 30, 2019 and later. Our state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute
of limitations for the years ended June 30, 2019 and later.
However, because of our prior net operating
losses and research credit carryovers, our tax years from June 30, 2007 are open to audit.
We do not anticipate a significant change
to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
NOTE 8.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Through June 2014, we
had
two equity compensation plans, the Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Option Plan (the “Employee Stock Option Plan”) and
the Amended and Restated 2004 Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the “Directors’ Stock Option Plan”) (collectively,
the “Former Stock Option Plans”). The Employee Stock Option Plan and Directors’ Stock Option Plan were terminated in
June 2014 and December 2014, respectively.
In September 2016, our Board approved
the establishment of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting. The 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan provides for the award of up to
1,500,000
shares of our common stock in the form of incentive stock options, nonstatutory
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock-based awards.
As of December 31, 2022,
200,000
performance awards and
372,000
non-qualified stock options have been granted under the 2016 Equity Incentive
Plan.
Former Stock Option Plans
No
options
were granted under the Former Stock Option Plans during the three or six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

PRO-DEX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

remaining stock options outstanding under the Former Stock Option Plans were exercised during the six months ended December 31,
2022. As such,
as of December 31, 2022, there was no unrecognized compensation cost under the
Former Stock Option Plans as
there are no options outstanding.

Performance Awards
In December 2017, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors granted
200,000
performance awards to our employees under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which will
generally be paid in shares of our common stock. Whether any performance awards vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the
completion
of service periods that range from 7 months to 9.5 years at inception and the achievement of our common stock trading at certain pre-determined
prices.
The weighted-average fair value of the performance awards granted was $ 4.46 , calculated using the weighted-average fair market
value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation. In February 2020, the Compensation Committee reallocated
48,000
previously forfeited
awards, having the same remaining terms and conditions, to certain employees. The weighted-average fair value of the performance awards
reallocated in 2020 was $ 16.90 , calculated using the weighted-average fair market value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation.
In December 2021, the Compensation Committee reallocated an additional
17,500
previously forfeited awards, having the same remaining terms
and conditions, to other employees. The weighted average fair value of the performance awards reallocated in 2021 was $ 20.34 , calculated
using the weighted average fair market value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation. During the three months ended December 31,
2022, and 2021, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $ 30,000
and $ 21,000 , respectively, related to outstanding performance
awards. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $ 60,000
and $ 42,000 , respectively,
related to outstanding performance awards. On December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 262,000
of unrecognized compensation cost related
to non-vested performance awards, which is expected to be expensed over the weighted-average period of
2.50
years.
On July 1, 2022, it was determined
by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors that the vesting of performance awards for
37,500
shares of common stock had been
achieved. Each participant elected a net issuance to cover their individual withholding taxes and therefore we issued
23,641
shares and
paid $ 223,000
of participant-related payroll tax liabilities.

Non-Qualified Stock Options
In December 2020, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors granted
310,000
non-qualified stock options to our directors and certain employees under the 2016
Equity Incentive Plan. The vesting of these stock options is tied to the
completion of service periods that range from 18 months to 10.5
years from the date of grant and the achievement of our common stock trading at certain pre-determined prices.
In December 2021, the Compensation
Committee reallocated 5,000 previously forfeited non-qualified stock options, having the same remaining terms and conditions, to another
employee. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded compensation expense of $ 140,000
and $ 254,000 , respectively,
related to these options. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded compensation expense of $ 312,000
and $ 527,000 ,
respectively, related to these options. The weighted average fair value of the stock option awards granted was $ 16.72 , calculated using
a Monte Carlo simulation. As of December 31, 2022, none of these stock options had vested and there was approximately $2.7 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to these stock options.
In February 2021, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors granted
62,000
non-qualified stock options to our directors and certain employees under the 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan. The vesting of these stock options is tied to the
completion of service periods that range from 4 months to 1.3 years
at inception and the achievement of our common stock trading at certain pre-determined prices.
Of these 62,000 stock options, 57,750 vested
on July 1, 2021, as our common stock met the pre-determined prices set forth in the underlying agreements and the required service periods
were already satisfied. The weighted-average fair value of the stock option awards granted was $ 3.16 , calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In September 2014, our Board approved
the establishment of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP conforms to the provisions of Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code, has coterminous
offering and purchase periods of six months, and bases the pricing to purchase shares of our common
stock on a formula so as to result in a per-share purchase price that approximates a 15% discount from the market price of a share of
our common stock at the end of the purchase period.
The Board of Directors also approved the provision that shares formerly reserved for
issuance under the Former Stock Option Plans in excess of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, aggregating
704,715
shares,
be reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. The ESPP was approved by our shareholders at our 2014 Annual Meeting.
During the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, we did
no t record any share-based compensation expense relating to the ESPP, due to the fact that no six-month offering
period ended during either quarter. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
2,503
and
1,130
shares of our common stock
were purchased under the ESPP, respectively, and allocated to employees based upon their contributions at prices of $ 13.52
and $ 26.17 ,
respectively, per share. On a cumulative basis, since the inception of the ESPP, employees have purchased a total of
29,542
shares of
our common stock. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded share-based compensation expense in the amount of
$ 6,000
and $ 5,000 , respectively, relating to the ESPP.

NOTES PAYABLE
AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS
Minnesota Bank & Trust
On
November 6, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), PDEX Franklin, a newly created wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased an
approximate 25,000 square foot industrial building in Tustin, California (the “Franklin Property”). A portion of the purchase
price was financed by a loan from MBT to PDEX Franklin in the principal amount of approximately $ 5.2
million (the “Property Loan”)
pursuant to a Loan Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, between PDEX Franklin and MBT (the “Property Loan Agreement”)
and corresponding Term Note (the “Property Note”) issued by PDEX Franklin in favor of MBT on the Closing Date. The Property
Loan is secured by the Franklin Property pursuant to a Deed of Trust with Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture
Filing in favor of MBT (the “Deed”) and by an Assignment of Leases and Rents by PDEX Franklin in favor of MBT (the “Rents
Assignment”). We paid loan origination fees to MBT on the Closing Date in the amount of $ 26,037 .
The
Property Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of
3.55 % per annum, which is subject to a 3% increase upon an event of default. Accrued interest
was paid on December 1, 2020, and both principal and interest in the amount of approximately $ 30,000
are due and payable on the first
day of each subsequent month until the maturity date of
November 1, 2030
(the “Maturity Date”), at which time a balloon payment
in the amount of $ 3.1
million is due.
Any prepayment of the Property Loan (other than monthly scheduled interest and principal payments),
is subject to a prepayment fee equal to 4% of the principal amount prepaid for any prepayment made during the first or second year, 3%
of the principal amount prepaid for any prepayment made during the third or fourth year, 2% of the principal amount prepaid for any prepayment
made during the fifth or sixth year, and 1% of the principal amount prepaid for any prepayment made during the seventh or eighth year.
The Property Loan Agreement, Property Note, Deed, and Rents Assignment each contain representations, warranties, covenants, and events
of default that are customary for a loan of this type. The balance owed on the Property Loan at December 31, 2022 is $ 4,842,000 .
On
the Closing Date, we also entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with MBT (the “Amended Credit Agreement”),
providing for a $ 7,525,000
amended and restated term loan (the “Term Loan A”), a $ 1,000,000
term loan (the “Term Loan
B”), and a $ 2,000,000
amended and restated revolving loan, evidenced by an Amended and Restated Term Note A (“Term Note A”),
a Term Note B, and an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note (the “Revolving Note”) made by us in favor of MBT. The loans
under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets pursuant to a Security Agreement entered
into on September 6, 2018, between the Company and MBT. The Term Note A had an outstanding principal balance of $ 3,770,331
as of the Closing
Date and could be borrowed against through May 30, 2021 (the “Commitment Period”). During the third quarter ended March 31,
2021, we borrowed an additional $ 3,000,000
against Term Note A for the purpose of repurchasing shares of our common stock. The Term Note
B had a zero balance as of the Closing Date and we borrowed the full $ 1,000,000
during the third quarter ended March 31, 2021, for the
purpose of making improvements to the Franklin Property.
The
Term Loan A matures on
November 1, 2027 , and bears interest at a fixed rate of
3.84 % per annum. Initial payments on the Term Loan A of
interest only were due on December 1, 2020 through June 1, 2021. Commencing July 1, 2021 and continuing on the first day of each month
thereafter until the maturity date,
we are required to make payments of principal and interest on Term Loan
A of approximately $ 97,000
plus any additional accrued and unpaid interest through the date of payment. The balance owed on Term Loan
A as of December 31, 2022, is $ 5,317,000 .
The
Term Loan B matures on
November 1, 2027 , and bears interest at a fixed rate of
3.84 % per annum. Initial payments on the Term Loan B of
interest only were due on December 1, 2020 through June 1, 2021. Commencing July 1, 2021 and continuing on the first day of each month
thereafter until the maturity date, we are required to make payments of principal and interest on Term Loan B of approximately $ 15,000 ,
plus any additional accrued and unpaid interest through the date of payment. The balance owing on Term Note B was $ 792,000
on December
31, 2022.
15
PRO-DEX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
On December 29, 2022 (the “Amendment
Date”), we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) with MBT, which amends
the Amended Credit Agreement and provides for a supplemental line of credit in the amount of $ 3,000,000
(the “Supplemental Loan”).
The Supplemental Loan is evidenced by a Supplemental Revolving Credit Note (the “Supplemental Note”) made by us in favor of
MBT. The purpose of the Supplemental Loan is for financing acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock. The Supplemental
Loan may be borrowed against from time to time through its maturity date of
December 29, 2024 , on the terms set forth in the Amended Credit
Agreement. As of December 31, 2022,
no
amounts have been drawn against the Supplemental Loan.
The Revolving Loan was also amended
(the “Amended Revolving Loan”) in connection with the Amendment to extend
the maturity date of the from November 5, 2023 to
December 29, 2024 , to increase the Revolving Loan facility from $ 2,000,000
to $ 7,000,000 , and to increase the interest rate on the Revolving
Loan (as described below), evidenced by an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note (the “Amended Revolving Note”) made
by us in favor of MBT. The Amended Revolving Loan may be borrowed against from time to time by us through its maturity date on the terms
set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we had drawn $ 1,800,000
against the Amended Revolving Loan. Loan origination
fees in the amount of $ 16,000
are payable to MBT in conjunction with the Revolving Loan and the Supplemental Loan.
The Amended Revolving Loan and
Supplemental Loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 5.0% or (b) SOFR for a one-month period from the
website of the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited plus 2.5% (the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”). Commencing on the
first day of each month after we initially borrow against the Amended Revolving Loan and/or the Supplemental Loan and each month
thereafter until maturity, we are required to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Amended Revolving Loan and Supplemental
Loan through the date of payment. Any principal on the Amended Revolving Loan and/or Supplemental Loan that is not previously
prepaid shall be due and payable in full on the maturity date (or earlier termination of the Amended Revolving Loan and/or
Supplemental Loan).
Any
payment on the Term Loan A, the Term Loan B, the Amended Revolving Loan or the Supplemental Loan (collectively, the “Loans”)
not made within seven days after the due date is subject to a late payment fee equal to
5 % of the overdue amount. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an event of default, the interest rate of all Loans will be increased by
3 % and MBT may, at its option,
declare all of the Loans immediately due and payable in full.
The
Amended Credit Agreement, Amended Security Agreement, Term Note A, Term Note B, Amended Revolving Note and Supplemental Note contain representations
and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default that are customary for loans of this type. We believe
that we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of December 31, 2022, but there can be no assurance that we will remain in
compliance for the duration of the term of these loans.
NOTE 11.
COMMON STOCK
Share Repurchase Program
In December 2019, our
Board approved a new share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to
one million
shares of our common stock, as the
prior repurchase plan authorized by our Board in 2013 was nearing completion. In accordance with, and as part of, these share
repurchase programs, our Board approved the adoption of several prearranged share repurchase plans intended to qualify for the safe
harbor provided by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“10b5-1 Plan” or
“Plan”). During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased
53,993
and
74,846
shares,
respectively, at an aggregate cost, inclusive of fees under the Plan, of $ 995,000
and
$ 1.3
million,
respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased
24,336
and
27,952
shares,
respectively, at an aggregate cost, inclusive of fees under the Plan, of $ 577,000
and
$ 672,000 ,
respectively. On a cumulative basis, since implementation of the share repurchase program in 2013, we have repurchased a total of
1,185,582
shares
under the share repurchase program at an aggregate cost, inclusive of fees, of $ 17.0
million.
All repurchases under the 10b5-1 Plans were administered through an independent broker.

At The Market Offering Agreement
In
December 2020, our Board approved an ATM Agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC (“Ascendiant”). The ATM Agreement
allows us to sell shares of our common stock in
transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market” equity offerings
as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions,
including on Nasdaq.
In connection with the ATM Agreement, we
entered into a prearranged
stock sales plan with Ascendiant, which is intended to qualify for the safe harbor under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (“ATM
10b5-1 Plan”). No sales of common stock have been made under the ATM Agreement as of the date of this report, but future sales may
occur pursuant to the parameters of the ATM 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise at the direction of our Board in accordance with the terms of the
ATM Agreement.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and
other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
The
following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding
of
the results of operations and financial condition of Pro-Dex, Inc. (“Company,” “Pro-Dex,”
“we,” “our,” or “us”) for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto
included
elsewhere
in this
report. This report contains certain
forward-looking statements and information. The cautionary statements included herein should be read as being applicable to all related
forward-looking statements wherever they may appear. Our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein.
Except
for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this report, including, but not limited to, discussions
of
our product development plans, business strategies, strategic opportunities, and market factors
influencing our results,
are
forward-looking
statements
that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as
a
result
of
various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability
to
continue
to
develop new products and increase
sales
in
markets
characterized
by
rapid technological evolution, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, customers, and us, consolidation within our target
marketplace and among our competitors, competition from larger, better capitalized competitors, and our ability to realize returns on
opportunities. Many other economic, competitive,
governmental,
and
technological factors could impact our ability to achieve our goals. You are urged to review the risks, uncertainties, and other cautionary
language described in this report, as well as
in
our other public disclosures and reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) from time to time, including, but not limited to, the risks, uncertainties,
and other cautionary language discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
We specialize in the design, development,
and manufacture of autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers used primarily in the orthopedic,
thoracic, and maxocranial facial (“CMF”) markets. We have patented adaptive torque-limiting software and proprietary
sealing solutions which appeal to our customers, primarily medical device distributors. We also manufacture and sell rotary air motors
to a wide range of industries.

Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated results
of operations presented in this report are not audited and those results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the entirety of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, or any other interim period during such fiscal year. Our fiscal year ends on
June 30 and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, and March 31. Unless otherwise stated, all dates refer to our fiscal
year and those fiscal quarters.
18
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
Our consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements
requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related
disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
An accounting policy is deemed to
be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time
the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably
likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Management believes that there have been no significant changes during
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2022.
Business Strategy and Future Plans
Our business today is almost entirely
driven by sales of our medical devices. Many of our significant customers place purchase orders for specific products that were developed
under various development and/or supply agreements. Our customers may request that we design and manufacture a custom surgical device
or they may hire us as a contract manufacturer to manufacture a product of their own design. In either case, we have extensive experience
with autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers. We continue to focus a significant percentage
of our time and resources on providing outstanding products and service to our valued principal customers. During the first quarter of
fiscal 2021, our largest customer executed an amendment to our existing supply agreement such that we shall continue to supply their surgical
handpieces to them through calendar 2025.
Simultaneously, we are working to
build top-line sales through active proposals of new medical device products with new and existing customers. Our patented adaptive torque-limiting
software has been very well received in the CMF and thoracic markets. Additionally, we have other significant engineering projects under
way described more fully below under “Results of Operations”.
In November 2020, we purchased an
approximate
25,000 square foot industrial building
in Tustin, California (the “Franklin
Property”). This building is located approximately four miles from our Irvine, California headquarters and was acquired to provide
us additional capacity for our expected continued future growth, including anticipated expanded capacity for the manufacture of batteries
and new products. We completed the build-out of the property during fiscal 2022 and we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization
to commence manufacturing activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are currently performing various verification and validation
activities for both equipment and processes, which includes the validation of our new clean room and we expect that we will begin operations
in the new facility during the third quarter of this fiscal year.
In summary, our current objectives
are focused primarily on maintaining our relationships with our current medical device customers, expanding our manufacturing capacity
with the addition of the Franklin Property, investing in research and development activities to design Pro-Dex branded drivers to leverage
our torque-limiting software, and promoting active product development proposals to new and existing customers for orthopedic shavers,
screw drivers for a multitude of surgical applications, and other medical devices, while monitoring closely the progress of all these
individual endeavors. Our investments in research and development have historically increased disproportionately to our growth in revenue
and we anticipate this may continue in future periods. These expenditures are being made in an effort to release new products and garner
new customer relationships. This fiscal year, however, the majority of our engineering efforts relate to customer funded NRE projects,
which costs are reclassified to cost of sales. While we expect revenue growth in the future, it may not be a consistent trajectory but
rather periods of incremental growth that current expenditures are helping to create. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be successful in any of these objectives.
19
COVID-19 Pandemic
We have adjusted certain policies
and procedures based on applicable national, state, and local emergency orders and safety guidance that may be issued from time to time,
in order to effectively manage our business during the pandemic and to keep our employees safe. These measures have changed over time
and continue to change as our specific circumstances change.
While we have yet to see any significant
decline in our customer orders, we have received and accepted some customer requests to delay the shipment of their existing orders. We
provide our largest customer with a device used primarily in elective surgeries and although this customer has not requested a reduction
or delay to their planned shipments, if this pandemic continues to adversely impact the United States and other markets where our products
are sold, coupled with the recommended deferrals of elective procedures by governments and other authorities, we would expect to see a
decline in demand from certain of our customers, including our principal customer.
We are
focused on the health and safety of all those we serve – our customers, our communities, our employees, and our suppliers. We are
supporting our customers according to their priorities and working with them to the degree that we can offer relief in the form of delayed
shipments. We are focused on continuity of supply by working with our suppliers, some of whom have delivered our orders late and are quoting
longer lead times.
During fiscal 2022, we began to
see some challenges in our supply chain in the form of delayed shipments, longer lead times, higher prices, and surcharges, much of which
our suppliers indicate have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have largely been able to mitigate our biggest supply chain concerns
by sourcing replacement chips through alternative suppliers, albeit at much higher prices, for many of our printed circuit board assemblies.
In so doing, our cost of sales increased during the second half of fiscal 2022 and thus far in fiscal 2023. We continue to implement plans
and processes to mitigate these challenges that many manufacturers similarly face. Our long-term prospects remain positive, and we believe
these challenges will negatively impact us only in the short-term.

Sales
of our medical device products increased $0.4 million, or 4%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased slightly by
$32,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
Sales
of our compact
pneumatic
air motors, reported as Industrial and scientific sales above, decreased
$30,000, or 13%, and $23,000, or 5%, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the corresponding
periods of the prior fiscal year. These are legacy products with no substantive marketing efforts. Our non-recurring (“NRE”)
and proto-type revenue increased $368,000, or 320%, and $1.1 million, or 347%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared
to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year, due to an increase in billable contracts for various NRE projects undertaken for
our customers.
Repair
revenue increased $521,000, or 33%, and $1.3 million, or 43%, respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared
to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year, and are primarily comprised of repairs of handpieces for our largest customer.
This increase was expected as we have been asked to upgrade handpieces to the next generation, which design was released to manufacture
in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect to continue to see increases in repair revenue for the remainder of this fiscal year because
our largest customer has requested, beginning in December 2022, that we perform an enhanced repair on each handpiece, which includes the
advance replacement of certain components.
At
December 31, 2022, we had a backlog of approximately $20.7 million, of which $12.0 million is scheduled to be delivered in the third and
fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 and the balance is scheduled to be delivered next fiscal year and beyond.
Our backlog represents
firm purchase orders received and acknowledged from our customers and does not include all revenue expected to be generated from existing
customer contracts.
We may experience variability in our new order bookings due to various reasons,
including, but not limited to, the timing of major new product launches and customer planned inventory builds. However, we do not typically
experience seasonal fluctuations in our shipments and revenues.

Cost
of sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.9 million, or 28%, and $3.5 million, or 26%, respectively,
compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Although some of the increase in cost of sales is consistent with the
11% increase in revenue for the same periods, approximately $432,000 and $882,000, of the increases, respectively, relate to the more
costly repairs performed to upgrade the orthopedic handpieces we sell our largest customer to the newest release at no additional cost.
In late December 2022 we began an enhanced repair program, which has an agreed upon repair price, such that we should see improvement
in our margins in the second half of fiscal 2023. That said, however, we are continuing to negotiate with our largest customer to recover
the additional cost of the repairs completed in the first half of this fiscal year. Additionally, under-absorption for the three and six
months ended December 31, 2022, increased $448,000, or 180%, and $875,000, or 858%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods
of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the growth of indirect costs in our machine shop, materials, assembly and quality departments
outpacing actual production hours.
Gross
profit decreased by $781,000, or 23%, and $1.2 million, or 18%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared
to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the increase in repair costs for our largest customer’s
handpiece as well as higher indirect costs in our machine shop, assembly, materials and quality departments. Gross margin as a percentage
of sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately eleven and nine percentage points, respectively,
compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year due to higher cost of sales described above.

Selling expenses consist of salaries
and other personnel-related expenses for our business development department, as well as advertising and marketing expenses, and travel
and related costs incurred in generating and maintaining our customer relationships. Selling expenses for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 increased $46,000 and $63,000, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily
due to increased sales commissions.
General and administrative expenses
(“G&A”) consists of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of our accounting, finance and human resource personnel,
as well as costs for outsourced information technology services, professional fees, directors’ fees, and other costs and expenses
attributable to being a public company. G&A decreased $214,000 and $282,000, respectively, during the three and six months ended December
31, 2022, when compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The decreases relate primarily to reduced legal expenses
related to employment matters and reduced non-cash compensation expense related to stock compensation, offset by increased legal fees
related to intellectual property matters.
Research and development costs generally
consist of salaries, employer paid benefits, and other personnel- related costs of our engineering and support personnel, as well as allocated
facility and information technology costs, professional and consulting fees, patent-related fees, lab costs, materials, and travel and
related costs incurred in the development and support of our products. Research and development costs for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 decreased $148,000 and $201,000, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. These
decreases are primarily due to increased personnel related expenses offset by decreased spending on internal development projects. When
our engineers are engaged in billable projects as opposed to internal projects, costs get shifted to cost of sales instead of research
and development.
23
Although the majority of our research
and development costs relate to sustaining activities related to products we currently manufacture and sell, we have created a product
roadmap to develop future products. The research and development costs represent between 31% and 41% of total operating expenses for all
periods presented and are expected to increase in the future as we continue to invest in our business. The amount spent on internal projects
under development is summarized below (in thousands):

(1) Represents the calendar quarter of expected market launch.
(2) The products in development include risks that they could be abandoned in the future prior to completion,
they could fail to become commercialized, or the actual annual revenue realized may be less than the amount estimated.
As we introduce new products into
the market, we expect to see an increase in sustaining and other engineering expenses. Typical examples of sustaining engineering activities
include, but are not limited to, end-of- life component replacement, especially in electronic components found in our printed circuit
board assemblies, analysis of customer complaint data to improve process and design, replacement and enhancement of tooling and fixtures
used in our machine shop, assembly operations, and inspection areas to improve efficiency and through-put. Additionally, these costs include
development projects that may be in their infancy and may or may not result in a full-fledged product development effort or projects that
are later abandoned. For instance, in prior filings we included expenses related to the VITAL ventilator product, which we have removed
from the table above because we did not spend any resources on this project in the first half of fiscal 2023 and we do not expect to in
the foreseeable future.
Interest & Other Income
Interest income for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes interest and dividends from our money market accounts and investment portfolio.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily
of interest expense related to our Minnesota Bank and Trust (“MBT”) loans described more fully in Note 10 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.
Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate for the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is slightly less than our combined expected federal and applicable state corporate income
tax rates due to federal and state research credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents at December

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities
was $2.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to net income of $2.0 million and non-cash depreciation and
amortization of $385,000 offset by unrealized gains on marketable securities in the amount of $408,000. Accounts receivable net collections
amounted to $3.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, offset by expenditures of $2.5 million for inventory, based primarily
upon a forecast received from our largest customer, which later was reduced. Although current inventory levels exceed immediate requirements
for this customer, they do not exceed the amounts that they will eventually purchase contractually.
Net cash provided by operating activities
was $4.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to net income of $2.0 million and non-cash stock-based compensation
and depreciation and amortization of $575,000 and $366,000, respectively. Although we experienced an influx of cash in the amount of $2.1
million in collections from receivables during the six months ended December 31, 2021, our inventory increased by $848,000.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $598,000 and related mostly to improvements and equipment primarily for the Franklin Property.
Net cash used in investing activities
for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $1.4 million and related to an investment in marketable securities of $334,000 and equipment
and improvements primarily for the Franklin Property of $1.1 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 included net principal payments of $839,000 on our existing loans from MBT more fully described
in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, the repurchase of $1.3 million of our
common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, as well as $223,000 of employee payroll taxes related to the award of 37,500 shares
of common stock to employees under previously granted performance awards.
Net cash used in financing activities
for the six months ended December 31, 2021 totaled $1.3 million and related primarily to the $672,000 repurchase of 27,952 shares of our
common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program as well as $616,000 of principal payments on our loans from MBT.
25
Financing Facilities & Liquidity Requirements for the Next Twelve
Months
As of December 31, 2022, our
working capital was $19.7 million. We currently believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with our
accounts receivable balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements as our business is currently
conducted for at least the next 12 months. In addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances, we expect to derive a portion
of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations. We may also borrow against our $7.0 million Amended Revolving Loan with MBT
(See Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report).
We are focused on preserving our
cash balances by monitoring expenses, identifying cost savings, and investing only in those development programs and products that we
believe will most likely contribute to our profitability. As we execute on our current strategy, however, we may require debt and/or equity
capital to fund our working capital needs and requirements for capital equipment to support our manufacturing and inspection processes.
In particular, we have experienced negative operating cash flow in the past, especially as we procure long-lead time materials to satisfy
our backlog, which can be subject to extensive variability. We believe that if we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations
we can do so by borrowing against our Amended Revolving Loan or by selling additional shares of our common stock under the ATM Agreement.
(See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report).
Investment Strategy
We invest surplus cash from time
to time through our Investment Committee, which is comprised of one management director, Richard Van Kirk, and two non-management directors,
Raymond Cabillot and Nicholas Swenson, who chairs the committee. Both Mr. Cabillot and Mr. Swenson are active investors with extensive
portfolio management expertise. We leverage the experience of these committee members to make investment decisions for the investment
of our surplus operating capital or borrowed funds. Additionally, many of our securities holdings include stocks of public companies that
either Messrs. Swenson or Cabillot or both may own from time to time either individually or through the investment funds that they manage,
or other companies whose boards they sit on. The Investment Committee approved each of the investments comprising the $2.9 million of
marketable public equity securities that we held at December 31, 2022.

Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
Chief Executive
Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our
principal
financial officer) have concluded based
on their evaluation as of December 31, 2022 that our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) are effective.
The term
“disclosure
controls and procedures,”
as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls
and
other procedures of
a
company
that are
designed
to
ensure
that
information required to
be
disclosed
by
the
company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed,
summarized
and
reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to
be
disclosed by
a
company
in the reports that
it
files or submits under
the Exchange
Act
is
accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
26
Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
During the three months ended December
31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls
In designing and evaluating our
disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
