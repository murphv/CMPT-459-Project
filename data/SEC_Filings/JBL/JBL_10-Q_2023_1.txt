Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein have been included. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jabil Inc. (the “Company”) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. Results for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. 2.
Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs The Company regularly sells designated pools of high credit quality trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. As these accounts receivable are sold without recourse, the Company does not retain the associated risks following the transfer of such accounts receivable to the respective financial institutions.
As of November 30, 2022, the
Company may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financial institutions may elect to purchase
specific accounts receivable at any one time up to a: (i) maximum aggregate amount available of $ 2.0  billion under
eight
trade accounts receivable sale programs, (ii) maximum amount available of
400  million CNY under
one
trade accounts receivable sale program and (iii) maximum amount available of
100  million CHF under
one
trade accounts receivable sale program. The trade accounts receivable sale programs expire on various dates through 2025.
The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the trade accounts receivable sale programs. Servicing fees related to the trade accounts receivable sale programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
In connection with the trade accounts receivable sale programs, the Company recognized the following (in millions):

billion under its commercial paper program. Debt Covenants Borrowings under the Company’s debt agreements are subject to various covenants that limit the Company’s ability to: incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, effect mergers and certain transactions, and effect certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates.

Asset-Backed Securitization Program Certain Jabil entities participating in the global asset-backed securitization program continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. In addition, a foreign entity participating in the global
7 Table of Contents      asset-backed securitization program sells certain receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a daily basis. The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under the global asset-backed securitization program. Servicing fees related to the global asset-backed securitization program recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities. The special purpose entity in the global asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering up to the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the domestic, or U.S., portion of the global asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of November 30, 2022. The global asset-backed securitization program expires on November 25, 2024 and the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time is $ 600
million. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had
no
available liquidity under its global asset-backed securitization program. In connection with the asset-backed securitization programs, the Company recognized the following (in millions):

(1) Service cost is recognized in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. (2) Components are recognized in other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. (3) Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal to
10
percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants. 9.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company’s financial performance and are referred to as market risks. The Company, where deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk Management Forward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $ 1.1
billion and $ 1.4
billion as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The forward foreign exchange contract transactions will effectively lock in the value of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses against foreign currency fluctuations. The anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses being hedged are expected to occur between December 1, 2022 and November 30, 2023.
In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, was $ 3.5
billion and $ 3.4
billion, respectively. The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for all periods presented and are included as components of net revenue, cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense, which are the same line items in which the hedged items are recorded. In addition, the Company has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign currency denominated operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The net investment hedges have an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $ 0.1  billion and $ 0.0 billion
as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are expected to mature in August 2023. The effective portion of the gain or loss on net investment hedges is reported in OCI to offset the change in the carrying value of the net investment being hedged until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the hedged foreign operation. The excluded components for the net investment hedges are not material and are recognized in interest expense. Refer to Note 16 – “Fair Value Measurements” for the fair values and classification of the Company’s derivative instruments.
The following table presents the net (losses) gains from forward contracts recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in millions): 9 Table of Contents

Concentration of Risk and Segment Data Concentration of Risk Sales of the Company’s products are concentrated among specific customers. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company’s five largest customers accounted for approximately
47 % of its net revenue and 75 customers accounted for approximately
90 % of its net revenue. Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (“DMS”) operating segments. The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source. Segment Data Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. An operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain items are excluded from the calculation of segment income. Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.

Effective income tax rate
25.6
%
23.9
% The effective income tax rate differed for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily due to increased losses in tax jurisdictions with minimal related income tax benefit, driven in part by restructuring charges, for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, primarily due to: (i) losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances and (ii) tax incentives granted to sites in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. 13 Table of Contents      15.
Earnings Per Share and Dividends Earnings Per Share The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities. The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock units. Potential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be antidilutive. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered dilutive when the related performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period. All potential shares of common stock are antidilutive in periods of net loss.
Potential shares of common stock not included in the computation of earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive or because the performance criterion was not met were as follows (in thousands):

(1) Consist of investments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of 90 days or less. 14 Table of Contents      (2) The Company’s forward foreign exchange contracts, including cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are measured on a recurring basis at fair value, based on foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers. (3) Fair value measurements are based on the contractual terms of the derivatives and use observable market-based inputs. The interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximates current market rates.
Notes payable and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost; however, the Company estimates the fair values of notes payable and long-term debt for disclosure purposes.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products. We derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as “manufacturing services”), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer. We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend for the foreseeable future, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue, which in turn depends upon their growth, viability and financial stability.
We conduct our operations in facilities that are located worldwide, including but not limited to, China, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. We derived a substantial majority, 85.7% of net revenue from our international operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022. Our global manufacturing production sites allow customers to manufacture products simultaneously in the optimal locations for their products. Our global presence is key to assessing and executing on our business opportunities. We have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (“DMS”), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and networking and storage industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. Our DMS segment includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, connected devices, healthcare and packaging, and mobility industries. We monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change. Refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 for further discussion of the items disclosed in Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section as of November 30, 2022 contained herein. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic, which began to impact us in January 2020, has continued to affect our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. Travel and business operation restrictions arising from virus containment efforts of governments around the world have continued to impact our operations in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Essential activity exceptions from these restrictions have allowed us to continue to operate but virus containment efforts have resulted in additional direct costs.
The impact on our suppliers has led to supply chain constraints, including difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill customer production requirements and challenges in transporting completed products to our end customers.

Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the Company’s operating results. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on the effective management of our sales cycle as well as timing of payments. Our sales cycle measures how quickly we can convert our manufacturing services into cash through sales. We believe the metrics set forth below are useful to investors in measuring our liquidity as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of management’s key financial performance indicators:
Three months ended
November 30, 2022
August 31, 2022
November 30, 2021
Sales cycle (1)
39 days

Days in inventory (4)
78 days

66 days
Days in accounts payable (5)
81 days
87 days
85 days
(1) The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter was a direct result of changes in these indicators. (2) Inventory turns (annualized) are calculated as 360 days divided by days in inventory.
(3) Days in accounts receivable is calculated as accounts receivable, net, divided by net revenue multiplied by 90 days.
(4) Days in inventory is calculated as inventory and contract assets divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the increase in days in inventory from the three months ended November 30, 2021 was primarily due to higher raw material balances due to supply chain constraints. (5) Days in accounts payable is calculated as accounts payable divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter and the three months ended November 30, 2021, was primarily due to timing of purchases and cash payments during the quarter. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note
1
— “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 18 Table of Contents      See Note 18 – “New Accounting Guidance” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance. Results of Operations Net Revenue Generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure. The distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

Net revenue increased during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. Specifically, the EMS segment net revenue increased 18% due to: (i) a 5% increase in revenues from existing customers within our 5G, wireless and cloud business, (ii) a 5% increase in revenues from existing customers within our digital print and retail business, (iii) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our networking and storage business, and (iv) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and capital equipment business. The DMS segment net revenue increased 8% due to: (i) a 7% increase in revenues from existing customers within our automotive and transportation business, and (ii) a 3% increase in revenues from existing customers within our healthcare and packaging business. The increase is partially offset by (i) a 1% decrease in revenues from existing customer within our mobility business and (ii) a 1% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our connected devices business. We expect an additional $300 million in components that we procure and integrate for our cloud business will shift from a purchase and resale model to a customer-controlled consignment service model for a total of $800 million during fiscal year 2023. As a result of this continued transition, revenue associated with these components are shown on a net basis and as a result, we expect higher gross margins and lower cash used in this business.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to a $7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to higher anticipated achievement levels for certain performance-based stock awards and awards granted during the three months ended November 30, 2022.

The effective income tax rate differed for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily due to increased losses in tax jurisdictions with minimal related income tax benefit, driven in part by restructuring charges, for the three months ended November 30, 2022. Non-GAAP (Core) Financial Measures The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliations below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP “core” financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. Also, our “core” financial measures should not be construed as an indication by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our “core” financial measures. For fiscal year 2023, the Company adopted an annual normalized tax rate (“normalized core tax rate”) for the computation of the non-GAAP (core) income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. In estimating the normalized core tax rate annually, the Company utilizes a full-year financial projection of core earnings that considers the mix of earnings across tax jurisdictions, existing tax positions, and other significant tax matters. The Company may adjust the normalized core tax rate during the year for material impacts from new tax legislation or material changes to the Company’s operations.
Prior to fiscal year 2023, the Company determined the tax effect of the items included and excluded from core earnings quarterly. Included in the tables below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 21 Table of Contents      Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures

When our customers reimburse us and obtain control, we recognized the cash receipts in proceeds and advances from the sale of PP&E. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our global asset-backed securitization program and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any share repurchases under the approved programs, any potential acquisitions, our working capital requirements and our contractual obligations for the next 12 months and beyond. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash. Cash and Cash Equivalents As of November 30, 2022, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which a significant portion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Most of our foreign cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 could be repatriated to the United States without potential tax expense.

(1) As of November 30, 2022, we had $3.8 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. The senior unsecured credit agreement dated as of January 22, 2020 and amended on April 28, 2021 (the “Credit Facility”) acts as the back-up facility for commercial paper outstanding, if any. We have a borrowing capacity of up to $3.2 billion under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings with an original maturity of 90 days or less are recorded net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and have been excluded from the table above. We have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. Our Senior Notes and our credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 5 – “Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Global Asset-Backed Securitization Program Certain Jabil entities participating in the global asset-backed securitization program continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. In addition, a foreign entity participating in the global asset-backed securitization program sells certain receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a daily basis. We continue servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receive a servicing fee under the global asset-backed securitization program. Servicing fees related to the global asset-backed securitization program recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were not material. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate that the fee we receive to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities. The special purpose entity in the global asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering up to the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the domestic, or U.S., portion of the global asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of November 30, 2022. The global asset-backed securitization program expires on November 25, 2024 and the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time is $600 million. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we sold $1.1 billion of trade accounts receivable and we received cash proceeds of $1.1 billion. As of November 30, 2022, we had no available liquidity under our global asset-backed securitization program.
The global asset-backed securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, we were in
23 Table of Contents      compliance with all covenants under our global asset-backed securitization program. Refer to Note 6 – “Asset-Backed Securitization Program” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the program. Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs As of November 30, 2022, we
may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financ ial institutions may elect to purchase specific accounts receivable at any one time up to a: (i) maximum aggregate amount available of $2.0 billion under eight trade accounts receivable sale programs, (ii) maximum amount available of 400 million CNY under one trade accounts receivable sale program and (iii) maximum amount available of 100 million CHF under one trade accounts receivable sale program. The trade accounts receivable sale programs expire on various dates through 2025.
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we sold $3.5 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $3.5 billion. As of November 30, 2022, we had up to $1.1 billion in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022, was primarily due to non-cash expenses and net income and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, contract assets, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of collections. The increase in inventories is primarily due to higher raw material balances due to supply chain constraints. The increase in contract assets is primarily due to timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to the timing of payments. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, principally to support ongoing business in the DMS and EMS segments, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, (iii) the purchase of treasury stock under employee stock plans, and (iv) dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by borrowings under debt agreements. Capital Expenditures For Fiscal Year 2023, we anticipate our net capital expenditures will be approximately $875 million. In general, our capital expenditures support ongoing maintenance in our DMS and EMS segments and investments in capabilities and targeted end markets. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. 24 Table of Contents      Dividends and Share Repurchases We currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and global economic conditions. In July 2021, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock (the “2022 Share Repurchase Program”). As of November 30, 2022, 15.0 million shares had been repurchased for $898 million and $102 million remains available under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. In September 2022, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”). As of November 30, 2022, no shares had been repurchased under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Contractual Obligations As of the date of this report, other than the new operating and finance leases, (see Note 4 – “Leases” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business, since August 31, 2022 to our contractual obligations and commitments and the related cash requirements.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act (the “Evaluation”), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of November 30, 2022. Based on the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting For our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022, we did not identify any modifications to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents      PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
