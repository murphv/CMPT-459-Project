SEMILEDS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Con solidated Financial Statements
1. Business SemiLEDs Corporation (“SemiLEDs” or the “parent company”) was incorporated in Delaware on
January 4, 2005
and is a holding company for various wholly owned subsidiaries. SemiLEDs and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) develop, manufacture and sell high performance light emitting diodes (“LEDs”). The Company’s core products are LED components, as well as LED chips and lighting products. LED components have become the most important part of its business. A portion of the Company’s business consists of the sale of contract manufactured LED products. The Company’s customers are concentrated in a few select markets, including the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Netherlands. As of November 30, 2022, SemiLEDs had
two
wholly owned subsidiaries. SemiLEDs Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., or Taiwan SemiLEDs, is the Company’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, where a substantial portion of the assets is held and located, and where a portion of our research, development, manufacturing and sales activities take place. Taiwan SemiLEDs owns a
97.37 % equity interest in Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd., formerly known as Silicon Base Development, Inc., which is engaged in the research, development, manufacturing and a substantial portion of marketing and sale of LED components, and where most of the Company’s employees are based.
SemiLEDs’ common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “LEDS”.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation
—The Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable provisions of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2022, the unaudited condensed statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the statements of changes in equity for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the statements of cash flows for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. The results for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending August 31, 2023. Going Concern
—The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements. 6
The Company suffered losses from operations of $ 3.2
million and $ 3.9
million and used net cash in operating activities of $ 1.5
million and $ 1.7
million for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These facts and conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, even though gross profit on product sales was $ 1.4
million for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $ 1.0
million for the year ended August 31, 2021. On November 30, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents had increased to $ 4.5
million compared to $ 4.1
million on November 30, 2021 mainly
due to the collection of accounts receivable, advances from customers and the issuance of common stock.
Further, loss from operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 654
thousand and $ 978
thousand, respectively.
However, management believes that it has developed a liquidity plan, as summarized below, that, if executed successfully, should provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due for a reasonable period of time, and allow the development of its core business.   • Gaining positive cash-inflow from operating activities through continuous cost reductions and the sales of new higher margin products. Steady growth of module products and the continued commercial sales of its UV LED product are expected to improve the Company’s future gross margin, operating results and cash flows. The Company is targeting niche markets and focused on product enhancement and developing its LED product into many other applications or devices. • Continuing to monitor prices, work with current and potential vendors to decrease costs and, consistent with its existing contractual commitments, may decrease its activity level and capital expenditures further. This plan reflects its strategy of controlling capital costs and maintaining financial flexibility. • Raising additional cash through further equity offerings, including sales through an at-the-market, or ATM, program, sales of assets and/or issuance of debt as considered necessary and looking at other potential business opportunities. While the Company's management believes that the measures described in the above liquidity plan will be adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements for the twelve months after the date that the financial statements are issued, there is no assurance that the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the liquidity plan may have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial position, and may adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Restricted Cash Equivalents
—Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserved bank accounts in Taiwan. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company’s restricted cash equivalents at current portion were amounted $ 81
thousand and $ 82
thousand, respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company’s restricted cash at noncurrent portion, which was recorded as other assets, were amounted $ 94
thousand and $ 96
thousand, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
—Effective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company applied the following five steps to achieve the core principles of ASC 606: 1) identified the contract with a customer; 2) identified the performance obligations (promises) in the contract; 3) determined the transaction price; 4) allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognized revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company recognizes the amount of revenue, when the Company satisfies a performance obligation, to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company obtains written purchase authorizations from its customers as evidence of an arrangement and these authorizations generally provide for a specified amount of product at a fixed price. Generally, the Company considers delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment as this is generally when title and risk of loss for the products will pass to the customer. The Company provides its customers with limited rights of return for non‑conforming shipments and product warranty claims. Based on historical return percentages, which have not been material to date, and other relevant factors, the Company estimates its potential future exposure on recorded product sales, which reduces product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and reduces accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also provides standard product warranties on its products, which generally range from
three months
to
two years . Management estimates the Company’s warranty obligations as a percentage of revenues, based on historical knowledge of warranty costs and other relevant factors. To date, the related estimated warranty provisions have been insignificant.
Principles of Consolidation
—The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SemiLEDs and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated during consolidation. On September 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 825-10, “Financial Instruments- Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. This standard allows equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to be re-measured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of impairment. The standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring assessment for impairment qualitatively at each reporting period. 7
Investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee but not a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are not consolidated. These investments are in joint ventures that are not subject to consolidation under the variable interest model, and for which the Company: (i) does not have a majority voting interest that would allow it to control the investee, or (ii) has a majority voting interest but for which other shareholders have significant participating rights, but for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method, investments are stated at cost after adding or removing the Company’s portion of equity in undistributed earnings or losses, respectively. The Company’s investment in these equity‑method entities is reported in the consolidated balance sheets in investments in unconsolidated entities, and the Company’s share of the income or loss of these equity‑method entities, after the elimination of unrealized intercompany profits, is reported in the consolidated statements of operations in equity in losses from unconsolidated entities. When net losses from an equity‑method investee exceed its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero. The Company then suspends using the equity method to provide for additional losses unless the Company has guaranteed obligations or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the equity‑method investee. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the investee subsequently returns to profitability and the Company’s share of the investee’s income exceeds its share of the cumulative losses that have not been previously recognized during the period the equity method is suspended. Investments in entities that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method are recorded as investments without readily determinable fair values. Investments without readily determinable fair values are reported on the consolidated balance sheets in investments in unconsolidated entities, at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Dividend income, if any, received is reported in the consolidated statements of operations in equity in losses from unconsolidated entities. If the fair value of an equity investment declines below its respective carrying amount and the decline is determined to be other‑than‑temporary, the investment will be written down to its fair value. Use of Estimates
—The preparation of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory net realizable values, realization of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation expense, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated entities, the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, income tax uncertainties, provision for potential litigation costs and other contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Management assesses these estimates on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties
—The Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position or results of operations, which risks and uncertainties include, among others: it has incurred significant losses over the past several years, any inability of the Company to compete in a rapidly evolving market and to respond quickly and effectively to changing market requirements, any inability of the Company to grow its revenue and/or maintain or increase its margins, it may experience fluctuations in its revenues and operating results, any inability of the Company to protect its intellectual property rights, claims by others that the Company infringes their proprietary technology, and any inability of the Company to raise additional funds in the future. Concentration of Supply Risk
—Some of the components and technologies used in the Company’s products are purchased and licensed from a limited number of sources and some of the Company’s products are produced by a limited number of contract manufacturers. The loss of any of these suppliers and contract manufacturers may cause the Company to incur transition costs to another supplier or contract manufacturer, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of the Company’s products, or cause it to carry excess or obsolete inventory. The Company relies on a limited number of such suppliers and contract manufacturers for the fulfillment of its customer orders. Any failure of such suppliers and contract manufacturers to perform could have an adverse effect upon the Company’s reputation and its ability to distribute its products or satisfy customers’ orders, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cashflows. Concentration of Credit Risk
—Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 8
The Company keeps its cash and cash equivalents in demand deposits with prominent banks of high credit quality and invests only in money market funds. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of the Company consisted of the following (in thousands):

The Company’s revenues are substantially derived from the sales of LED products. A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from a limited number of customers and sales are concentrated in a few select markets. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Management evaluates the need to establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses at each reporting period. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the management’s assessment of the collectability of its customer accounts. Management regularly reviews the allowance by considering certain factors, such as historical experience, industry data, credit quality, ages of accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Net revenues generated from sales to the top ten customers represented
93 % and
90 % of the Company’s total net revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets, including the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Netherlands. Net revenues generated from sales to customers in these markets, in the aggregate, accounted for
89 % and
85 % of the Company’s net revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncontrolling Interests
—Noncontrolling interests are classified in the consolidated statements of operations as part of consolidated net income (loss) and the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets as part of equity. Changes in ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as an equity transaction. If a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership interests are remeasured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings. On September 1, 2018, Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd., the Company’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, issued
414,000
common shares and amended its certificate of incorporation to increase its issued common stock from
12,087,715
to
12,501,715 . As of the issuance date, the increased capital of $ 176
thousand (NT$ 5.4
million) has been completely received in cash by Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd. The Company did not subscribe for the newly issued common shares, and, as a result, noncontrolling interest in the Company was increased from
zero
to
3.31 %. From January 2019 to September 2020, the Company purchased additional
33,000
common shares of SBDI from non-controlling shareholders. From March 2022 to May 2022, the Company purchased additional
52,000
common shares of SBDI from non-controlling shareholders. Therefore, noncontrolling interest in SBDI was down to
2.63 % as of November 30, 2022.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and result in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume share settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether collateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted, but only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own
9
Equity
(Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. The Company concluded that the standard will have no material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Equity Investments without readily determinable fair value
Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the Company) which do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded as equity investment without readily determinable fair value. All equity investments without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuers.
5. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Agreements
— The Company has several operating leases with unrelated parties, primarily for land, plant and office spaces in Taiwan, which include cancelable and noncancelable leases and which expire at various dates between
December 2024
and
December 2040 .
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, the Company did not combine lease and non-lease components. Most
leases do not include options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options has to be agreed by the lessors. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the term of leases, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Lease expense related to these
11
noncancelable
operating leases were $ 41
thousand and $ 42
thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases is presented below:

—The Company had purchase commitments for inventory, property, plant and equipment in the amount of $ 120
thousand and $ 121
thousand as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Litigation
—The Company is directly or indirectly involved from time to time in various claims or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company recognizes a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in assessing both the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and whether the amount of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated.
As of November 30, 2022, there was no pending or threatened litigation that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 12
6. Common Stock On July 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the “Agent”). In accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Company may offer and sell from time to time through the Agent the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 20,000,000
(the “Placement Shares”). Sales of the Placement Shares, if any, will be made on Nasdaq at market prices by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company paid a commission to the Agent of
3.0 % of the gross proceeds of the sale of the Placement Shares sold under the Agreement and reimburse the Agent for certain expenses. In July 2021,
344,391
shares of the Company’s common stock were issued for gross proceeds of $ 4,175,225 , before placement agent fees and legal fees of $ 126,576 .
During the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company sold
286,328
shares of the Company’s common stock for gross proceeds of $ 995,099
before placement agent fees and bank fees of $ 30,626 .
No
sales were made during the quarter ended November 30, 2022.
7. Stock-based Compensation The Company currently has
one
equity incentive plan (the “2010 Plan”), which provides for awards in the form of restricted shares, stock units, stock options or stock appreciation rights to the Company’s employees, officers, directors and consultants. In April 2014, SemiLEDs’ stockholders approved an amendment to the 2010 Plan that increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by an additional
250
thousand shares. On July 31, 2019, the stockholders approved an increase in the authorized share reserve under the 2010 plan by an additional
500
thousand shares, to extend expiration of the 2010 Plan to
November 3, 2023 , to remove the IRS Code section 162(m) provisions, and to modify the maximum grant limit to
35
thousand shares to one person in a one year period. On September 25, 2020, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the authorized shares reserve by an additional
400
thousand shares. A total of
1,421
thousand and
1,421
thousand shares was reserved for issuance under and 2010 Plan as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and 2021, there were
820
thousand and
1,015
thousand shares of common stock available for future issuance under the equity incentive plans. In November 2022, SemiLEDs granted
15
thousand restricted stock units to its directors that will vest
25 % every three months
on February 7, 2023, May 7, 2023, August 7, 2023 and November 7, 2023. In the event that the 2023 annual meeting falls before November 7, 2023, 100% of the stock shall immediately vest on the date of the 2023 annual meeting. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 2.33
per unit. In November 2021, SemiLEDs granted
15
thousand restricted stock units to its directors that vest in quarterly installments on February 12, 2022, May 12, 2022, August 12, 2022 and November 12, 2022. Because the 2022 annual meeting was held on September 13, 2022, 100% of the stock units immediately vested on the date of the 2022 annual meeting. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 7.10
per unit. In November 2021, SemiLEDs granted
98.5
thousand restricted stock units to its employees, which vest in eight quarterly installments commencing November 2021 and will become fully vested upon a change in control. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 7.10
per unit. In November 2020, SemiLEDs granted
15
thousand restricted stock units to its directors, which vested in quarterly installments on each of February 12, 2021, May 12, 2021, August 12, 2021 and November 12, 2021. Because the 2021 annual meeting was held on September 24, 2021, 100% of the stock units immediately vested on the date of the 2021 annual meeting. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 3.00
per unit. In November 2020, SemiLEDs granted
33
thousand restricted stock units to its employees, which vested
25 % on each of February 12, 2021, May 12, 2021 and August 12, 2021 and November 12, 2021 and became fully vested upon a change in control. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 3.00
per unit. In January 2020, SemiLEDs granted
136
thousand restricted stock units to its employees, which vest
25 % each year on January 10 of 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 and will become fully vested upon a change in control. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units was $ 2.39
per unit.
The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs including the market price of SemiLEDs’ common stock on the date of grant, the term that the stock options are expected to be outstanding, the implied stock volatilities of several of the Company’s publicly-traded peers over the expected term of stock options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant
13
judgment to determine. The grant date fair value of stock units is based upon the market price of SemiLEDs’ common stock on the date of the grant. This fair value is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those stock-based awards that are expected to vest. A forfeiture rate is estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. A forfeiture rate of
zero
is estimated for stock-based awards with vesting term that is less than or equal to
one year
from the date of grant. A summary of the stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):

Unrecognized Tax Benefits On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was adopted, which among other effects, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to
21 % from
34 % (or 35% in certain cases) beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that is payable over
eight years , makes the receipt of future non-U.S. sourced income of non-U.S. subsidiaries tax-free to U.S. companies and creates a new minimum tax on the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries relating to the parent’s deductions for payments to the subsidiaries. Provisional estimate of the Company is that no tax will be due under this provision. As of both November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company had
no
unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various U.S. states and certain foreign jurisdictions. The tax years
2017
through
2021
remain open in most jurisdictions. With few exceptions, as of November 30, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2016. The Company is not currently under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state or foreign jurisdictions.
10. Related Party Transactions On November 25, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, the Company issued convertible unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”) to J.R. Simplot Company, its largest shareholder, and Trung Doan, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, (together, the “Holders”) with a principal sum of $ 1.5
million and $ 500
thousand, respectively, and an annual interest rate of
3.5 %.
Principal and accrued interest
14
shall
be due on demand by the Holders on and at any time after
May 30, 2021 . On February 7, 2020, J.R. Simplot Company assigned all of its right, title and interest in and to Simplot Taiwan Inc. The outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest of the Notes may be converted into the Company’s common stock based on a conversion price of $ 3.00
per share, at the option of the Holders any time from the date of the Notes. On May 25, 2020, each of the Holders converted $ 300,000
of the Notes into
100,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. On May 26, 2021, the Notes were extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and were scheduled to mature on
May 30, 2022 , and on May 26, 2022, the Notes were further extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and now mature on
May 30, 2023 . As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the outstanding principal of these notes totaled $ 1.4
million. On January 8, 2019, the Company entered into loan agreements with each of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the largest shareholder of the Company, with aggregate amounts of $ 1.7
million and $ 1.5
million, respectively, and an annual interest rate of both
8 %. All proceeds of the loans were exclusively used to return the deposit to Formosa Epitaxy Incorporation in connection with the cancelled proposed sale of the Company’s headquarters building pursuant to the agreement dated December 15, 2015. The Company was required to repay the loans of $ 1.5
million on
January 14, 2021
and $ 1.7
million on
January 22, 2021 , respectively, unless the loans were sooner accelerated pursuant to the loan agreements. On January 16, 2021, the maturity date of these loans was extended with same terms and interest rate for one year to
January 15, 2022 , and on January 14, 2022, the maturity date of these loans was further extended with same terms and interest rate for one more year to
January 15, 2023 . As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, these loans totaled $ 3.2
million. The loans are secured by a second priority security interest on the headquarters building of the Company.
11. Subsequent Events
The Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to November 30, 2022 to the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, finding that the impact of COVID-19 and subsequent variants on the Company is unknown at this time and the financial consequences of this situation cause uncertainty as to the future and its effects on the economy and the Company. On December 20, 2022, the Company made a prepayment of investment of $ 1.2
million in Taiwan SemiLEDs, the Company's wholly owned operating subsidiary, to purchase the additional shares of common stocks to be issued by Taiwan SemiLEDs. Except for the above, the Company has determined that it does not have any other material subsequent events to disclose in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding the future results of operations of SemiLEDs Corporation, or “we,” “our” or the “Company,” and financial position, strategy and plans, and our expectations for future operations, including the execution of our restructuring plan and any resulting cost savings, are forward-looking statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “design,” “intend,” “expect” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. These factors include, among other things,
• Declining cash position.
• Our ability to improve our liquidity, access alternative sources of funding and obtain additional equity capital or credit when necessary for our operations, the difficulty of which may increase if our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market.
• Our ability to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements to avoid our stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.
• The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the business of our customers.
• The inability of our suppliers or other contract manufacturers to produce products that satisfy our requirements.
• Our ability to implement our cost reduction programs and to execute our restructuring plan effectively.
• Our ability to improve our gross margins, reduce our net losses and restore our operations to profitability.
• Our ability to successfully introduce new products that we can produce and that customers will purchase in such amounts as to be sufficiently profitable to cover the costs of developing and producing these products, as well as providing us additional net income from operations.
• Our ability to effectively develop, maintain and expand our sales and distribution channels, especially in the niche LED markets, including the UV LED and architectural lighting that we focus on.
• Our ability to successfully manage our operations in the face of the cyclicality, rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence, declining average selling prices and wide fluctuations in supply and demand typically found in the LED market.
• Competitive pressures from existing and new companies.
• Our ability to grow our revenues generated from the sales of our products and to control our expenses.
• Loss of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel.
• Intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties against us or our customers, including our distributor customers.
• The failure of LEDs to achieve widespread adoption in the general lighting market, or if alternative technologies gain market acceptance.
• The loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers.
• Our ability to effectively expand or upgrade our production facilities or do so in a timely or cost-effective manner.
• Difficulty in managing our future growth or in responding to a need to contract operations, and the associated changes to our operations.
• Adverse development in those selected markets, including the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Netherlands, where our revenues are concentrated, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation on customer demand.
16
• Our ability to develop and execute upon a new strategy to exploit the China and India market.
• The reduction or elimination of government investment in LED lighting or the elimination of, or changes in, policies in certain countries that encourage the use of LEDs over some traditional lighting technologies.

Company Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell light emitting diode (LED) chips and LED components, LED modules and systems. Our products are used for general lighting and specialty industrial applications, including ultraviolet, or UV, curing of polymers, LED light therapy in medical/cosmetic applications, counterfeit detection, germicidal and viricidal devices, LED lighting for horticulture applications, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting.
Utilizing our patented and proprietary technology, our manufacturing process begins by growing upon the surface of a sapphire wafer, or substrate, several very thin separate semiconductive crystalline layers of gallium nitride, or GaN, a process known as epitaxial growth, on top of which a mirror‑like reflective silver layer is then deposited. After the subsequent addition of a copper alloy layer and finally the removal of the sapphire substrate, we further process this multiple‑layered material to create individual vertical LED chips.
We package our LED chips into LED components, which we sell to distributors and a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets, including Taiwan, the United States, the Netherlands, Germany and India. We also sell our “Enhanced Vertical,” or EV, LED product series in blue, white, green and UV in selected markets. We sell our LED chips to packagers or to distributors, who in turn sell to packagers. Our lighting products customers are primarily original design manufacturers, or ODMs, of lighting products and the end‑users of lighting devices. We also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain LED products, and for certain aspects of our product fabrication, assembly and packaging processes, based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process.
We have developed advanced capabilities and proprietary know-how in:
• reusing sapphire substrate in subsequent production runs;
• optimizing our epitaxial growth processes to create layers that efficiently convert electrical current into light;
• employing a copper alloy base manufacturing technology to improve our chip’s thermal and electrical performance;
• utilizing nanoscale surface engineering to improve usable light extraction;
• manufacturing extremely small footprint LEDs with optimized yield, ideal for Mini LED applications;
• developing a LED structure that generally consists of multiple epitaxial layers which are vertically-stacked on top of a copper alloy base;
• developing low cost Chip Scaled Packaging (CSP) technology; and
• developing multi-pixel Mini LED packages for commercial displays.
These technical capabilities enable us to produce LED chips, LED component, LED modules and System products. We believe these capabilities and know-how should also allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs and our dependence on sapphire, a costly raw material used in the production of sapphire-based LED devices.
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 4, 2005. We are a holding company for various wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. SemiLEDs Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., or Taiwan SemiLEDs, is our wholly owned operating subsidiary, where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located, where a portion of our research, development, manufacturing and sales activities take place. Taiwan SemiLEDs owns an approximately 97.37% equity interest in Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd., formerly known as Silicon Base Development, Inc., which is engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and substantial portion of marketing and sale of LED products, including lighting fixtures and systems, and where most of our employees are based.
Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Business
The following are key factors that we believe affect our financial condition, results of operations and business:
• COVID-19 Pandemic.
Our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by COVID-19 and related restrictions. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our products or services, delayed prospective customers' purchasing decisions. We have also devoted ourselves to new product development and expect these new products could bring in new revenue, offsetting the losses resulted from existing customers’ delayed purchasing. However, given the ongoing and evolving economic and business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent variants, we may be
18
required to further revise certain accounting estimates and judgments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
• Our ability to raise additional debt funding, sell additional equity securities and improve our liquidity.
We need to improve our liquidity, access alternative sources of funding and obtain additional equity capital or credit when necessary for our operations. In July 2021, we established an at-the-market equity program (“ATM”) that allows us to sell up to $20 million of shares of our common stock from time to time. During fiscal 2022, we sold 286,328 shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM program for net proceeds of $964,473. However, we may not be able to obtain new debt funding or sell additional equity securities on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The raising of additional debt funding by us, if required and available, would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financing covenants, or liens on our assets, that would restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, if required and available, could result in dilution to our stockholders.
• Our ability to get chips from other chip suppliers.
Our reliance on our chip suppliers exposes us to a number of significant risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and production costs, lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply. If our chip suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to supply our chips at requested quality, quantity, performance and costs, or in a timely manner, our business and reputation could be seriously harmed. Our inability to procure chips from other chip suppliers at the desired quality, quantity, performance and cost might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. In such events, our customer relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
• Industry growth and demand for products and applications using LEDs.
The overall adoption of LED lighting devices to replace traditional lighting sources is expected to influence the growth and demand for LED chips and component products and impact our financial performance. We believe the potential market for LED lighting will continue to expand. LEDs for efficient generation of UV light are also starting to gain attention for various medical, germicidal and industrial applications. Since a substantial portion of our LED chips, LED components and our lighting products are used by end‑users in general lighting applications and specialty industrial applications such as UV curing, medical/cosmetic, counterfeit detection, horticulture, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting the adoption of LEDs into these applications will have a strong impact on the demand of LED chips generally and, as a result, for our LED chips, LED components and LED lighting products.
• Average selling price of our products.
The average selling price of our products may decline for a variety of factors, including prices charged by our competitors, the efficacy of our products, our cost basis, changes in our product mix, the size of the order and our relationship with the relevant customer, as well as general market and economic conditions. Competition in the markets for LED products is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. For example, some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices, and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices, accelerating the decline in our revenues and the gross margin of our products. When prices decline, we must also write down the value of our inventory. Furthermore, the average selling prices for our LED products have typically decreased over product life cycles. Therefore, our ability to continue to innovate and offer competitive products that meet our customers’ specifications and pricing requirements, such as higher efficacy LED products at lower costs, will have a material influence on our ability to improve our revenues and product margins, although in the near term the introduction of such higher performance LED products may further reduce the selling prices of our existing products or render them obsolete.
• Changes in our product mix.
We anticipate that our gross margins will continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell and the utilization of our manufacturing capacity in any given period, among other things. For example, we continue to pursue opportunities for profitable growth in areas of business where we see the best opportunity to develop as an end-to-end LED module solution supplier by providing our customers with high quality, flexible and more complete LED system solution, customer technical support and LED module/system design, as opposed to just providing customers with individual components. As a strategic plan, we have placed greater emphasis on the sales of LED components rather than the sales of LED chips where we have been forced to cut prices on older inventory. The growth of our module products and the continued commercial sales of our UV LED product are expected to improve our gross margin, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have adjusted the lower-priced LED components strategy as appropriate. We have adopted a strategy to adjust our product mix by exiting certain high volume but low unit selling price product lines in response to the general trend of lower average selling prices for products that have been available in the market for some time. However, as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices, or execute new business initiatives, a change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may increase volatility in our revenues and gross margin from period to period.
19
• Our ability to reduce cost to offset lower average selling prices.
Competitors may reduce average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs, and competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average selling prices. To address increased pricing pressure, we have improved and increased our production yields to reduce the per-unit cost of production of our products. However, such cost savings currently have limited impact on our gross profit, as we currently suffer from the underutilization of manufacturing capacity and must absorb a high level of fixed costs, such as depreciation. While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term we expect to be required to invest substantially in LED component products development and production equipment if we are to grow.
• Our ability to continue to innovate.
As part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to be innovative in product design, to deliver new products and to improve our manufacturing efficiencies. Our continued success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new, technologically advanced and lower cost products, such as more efficient, better performance LED component products. If we are unable to introduce new products that are commercially viable and meet rapidly evolving customer requirements or keep pace with evolving technological standards and market developments or are otherwise unable to execute our product innovation strategy effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise, execute our business plan or be able to compete effectively. To differentiate ourselves from other LED package manufacturers, we are putting more resources towards module and system design. Along with our technical know-how in the chip and package sectors, we are able to further integrate electrical, thermal and mechanical manufacturing resources to provide customers with one-stop system services. Services include design, prototyping, OEM and ODM. Key markets that we intend to target at the system end include different types of UV LED industrial printers, aquarium lighting, medical applications, niche imaging light engines, horticultural lighting and high standard commercial lighting. The modules are designed for various printing, curing, and PCB exposure industrial equipment, providing uncompromised reliability and optical output. Our LED components include different sizes and wattage to accommodate different demands in the LED market.
• General economic conditions and geographic concentration.
Many countries including the United States and the European Union (the “E.U.”) members have instituted, or have announced plans to institute, government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting. These actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting, which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. When the global economy slows or a financial crisis occurs, consumer and government confidence declines, with levels of government grants and subsidies for LED adoption and consumer spending likely to be adversely impacted. Our revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets, including the Netherlands, Taiwan, the United States, Germany, and Japan. Given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry, our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Therefore, our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets. For example, the aggressive support by the Chinese government for the LED industry through significant government incentives and subsidies to encourage the use of LED lighting and to establish the LED‑sector companies has resulted in production overcapacity in the market and intense competition. Furthermore, due to Chinese package manufacturers increasing usage of domestic LED chips, prices are increasingly competitive, leading to Chinese manufacturers growing market share in the global LED industry. In addition, we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. Some of our largest customers and what we produce/have produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete, large project‑based purchases and broadening customer base, among other things. For the years ended For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, sales to our three largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 65% and 68% of our revenues, respectively. Revlon, our largest customer in fiscal 2022, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2022, which resulted in a write off receivables of $126 thousand for the year ended August 31, 2022. If Revlon is not able to reorganize its business successfully, our revenue and financial results could be adversely impacted.
• Intellectual property issues.
Competitors of ours and other third parties have in the past and will likely from time to time in the future allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture, use or sell products found to be infringing. However, other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products, or our customers’ products that incorporate our technologies or products. Any such legal action or the threat of legal action against us, or our customers, could impair such customers’ continued demand for our products. This could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues, or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
20
• Cash position.
Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $4.5 million as of November 30, 2022 from $4.3 million as of August 31, 2022, primarily due to the collection of accounts receivable and advances from customers. We have implemented actions to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve operational efficiencies. The plan is further enhanced through the fabless business model in which we implemented certain workforce reductions and are exploring the opportunities to sell certain equipment related to the manufacturing of vertical LED chips, in order to reduce the idle capacity charges and minimize our research and development activities associated with chips manufacturing operation. In December 2019, we issued convertible unsecured promissory notes with a principal sum of $2 million, of which, $600 thousand convertible notes were converted into 200 thousand shares of common stock in May 2020. On May 26, 2021 the Notes were extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and mature on May 30, 2022, and on May 26, 2022, the Notes were further extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and now mature on May 30, 2023. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the outstanding principal of these notes totaled $1.4 million. Based on our current financial projections, we believe that we will have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditure plans for the next 12 months.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Item 1 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes the amount of revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company obtains written purchase authorizations from its customers as evidence of an arrangement and these authorizations generally provide for a specified amount of product at a fixed price. Generally, the Company considers delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment as this is generally when title and risk of loss for the products will pass to the customer. The Company provides its customers with limited rights of return for non-conforming shipments and product warranty claims. Based on historical return percentages, which have not been material to date, and other relevant factors, the Company estimates its potential future exposure on recorded product sales, which reduces product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and reduces accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also provides standard product warranties on its products, which generally range from three months to two years. Management estimates the Company’s warranty obligations as a percentage of revenues, based on historical knowledge of warranty costs and other relevant factors. To date, the related estimated warranty provisions have been insignificant. Refer to Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.
Accounts Receivable
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. Management regularly reviews the allowance by considering certain factors such as historical experience, industry data, credit quality, age of accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. No bad debt expenses were recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.
Write-down of Inventories
The Company writes down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value. The net realized value of inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and disposal. The estimation of net realized value is based on current market conditions and historical experience with product sales of similar nature. Changes in market conditions may have a material impact on the estimation of the net realizable value.
For finished goods and work in process, if the estimated net realizable value for an inventory item, which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs to completion and disposal, is lower than its cost, the specific inventory item is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Net realizable value for raw materials is based on replacement cost. Provisions for inventory write downs are included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Once written down, inventories are carried at this lower cost basis until sold or scrapped. Inventory write‑downs to estimated net realizable values were $178 thousand and $231 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Exchange Rate Information
We are a Delaware corporation and, under SEC requirements, must report our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. At the same time, our subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. For example, the functional currency for Taiwan SemiLEDs is the
21
NT dollar. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are, therefore, translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Any gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a separate component of other income (expense). Due to exchange rate fluctuations, such translated amounts may vary from quarter to quarter even in circumstances where such amounts have not materially changed when denominated in their functional currencies.
The translations from NT dollars to U.S. dollars were made at the exchange rates as set forth in the statistical release of the Bank of Taiwan. On November 30, 2022, the exchange rate was 30.89 NT dollars to one U.S. dollar. On December 30, 2022, the exchange rate was 30.71 NT dollars to one U.S. dollar.
No representation is made that the NT dollar or U.S. dollar amounts referred to herein could have been or could be converted into U.S. dollars or NT dollars, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.

Revenues, net
Our revenues increased by 16% to $1.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 from $1.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in revenues was caused primarily by a $31 thousand increase in sales of LED chips, a $70 thousand increase in Lighting products and a $417 thousand increase in other operating revenue offset by a $288 thousand decrease in LED components.
Revenues attributable to the sales of our LED chips represented 3% and 1% of our revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in revenues attributable to sales of LED chips was primarily due to varying volumes sold for the LED chips. We have adopted a strategy to adjust our product mix by exiting certain high volume but low unit selling price product lines in response to the general trend of lower average selling prices for products that have been available in the market for some time and to focus on profitable products.
Revenues attributable to the sales of our LED components represented 49% and 77% of our revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in revenues attributable to sales of LED components was primarily due to less volumes sold.
Revenues attributable to the sales of lighting products represented 9% and 6% of our revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenues attributable to the sales of lighting products were higher for the three months ended November 30, 2022 primarily due to more demand for the lighting products sold.
Revenues attributable to other operating revenues represented 39% and 16% of our revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in revenues attributable to other revenues was primarily due to the non-recurring sale of raw materials and a joint development project with CrayoNano AS beginning in January 2022.
22
Cost of Revenues
Our cost of revenues decreased by 2% from $1.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021 to $1.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to the decrease in the volume of products sold.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit increased from $203 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2021 to $463 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The increase was a result of focusing on profitable products described above.

The decrease in interest expenses, net for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was insignificant.
Other income, net.
Other income, net decreased from $566 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2021 to $242 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to the subsidies from a government jointly developed research project received in October 2021.
Foreign currency transaction loss, net.
We recognized a net foreign currency transaction loss of $10 thousand and $22 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to the impact of a higher exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar from bank deposits and accounts receivable.
Income Tax Expense.
Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately zero for fiscal 2023 and 2022, since Taiwan SemiLEDs incurred losses, and because we provided a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets, which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and foreign investment loss.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
This section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements, contingencies, sources and uses of cash, operations, working capital and long-term assets and liabilities.
Contingencies
We have several operating leases with third parties, primarily for land, plant and office spaces in Taiwan, including cancellable and noncancelable leases that expire at various dates between December 2024 and December 2040. See Note 5, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Sources and Uses of Cash
As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, which were predominately held in U.S. dollar denominated demand deposits and/or money market funds.
As of December 30, 2022, we had no available credit facility.
Long-term assets and liabilities
Our long-term assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating lease assets and investments in unconsolidated entities. Our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently. We believe that near-term access to additional manufacturing capacity, should it be required, could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties. We will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic manufacturing in the future for additional capacity.
Our long-term liabilities consist primarily long-term debt and operating lease liabilities.
Our long-term debt, which consisted of NT dollar denominated long-term notes, convertible unsecured promissory notes, and loans from our Chairman and our largest shareholder, totaled $6.8 million and $6.9 million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively.
Our NT dollar denominated long-term notes, totaled $3.2 million of both November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022. These long-term notes consisted of two loans which we entered into on July 5, 2019, with aggregate amounts of $3.2 million (NT$100 million). The first loan originally for $2.0 million (NT$62 million) has an annual floating interest rate equal to the NTD base lending rate plus 0.64% (or 2.04% currently), and was exclusively used to repay the existing loans. The second loan originally for $1.2 million (NT$38 million) has an annual floating interest rate equal to the NTD base lending rate plus 1.02% (or 2.42% currently) and is available for operating capital. These loans are secured by an $81 thousand (NT$2.5 million) security deposit and a first priority security interest on the Company’s headquarters building.
• Starting from May 2021, the first note payable requires monthly payments of principal in the amount of $24 thousand plus interest over the 74-month term of the note with final payment to occur in July 2027 and, as of November 30, 2022, our outstanding balance on this note payable was approximately $1.4 million.
• Starting from May 2021, the second note payable requires monthly payments of principal in the amount of $15 thousand plus interest over the 74-month term of the note with final payment to occur in July 2027 and, as of November 30, 2022, our outstanding balance on this note payable was approximately $833 thousand.
24
Property, plant and equipment pledged as collateral for our notes payable were $2.7 million and $2.8 million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively.
On January 8, 2019, we entered into loan agreements with each of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our largest shareholder, with aggregate amounts of $3.2 million, and an annual interest rate of 8%. All proceeds of the loans were exclusively used to return the deposit to Formosa Epitaxy Incorporation in connection with the proposed sale of our headquarters building pursuant to the agreement dated December 15, 2015. We were initially required to repay the loans of $1.5 million on January 14, 2021 and $1.7 million on January 22, 2021, respectively. On January 16, 2021, the maturity date of these loans was extended with same terms and interest rate for one year to January 15, 2022, and on January 14, 2022, the maturity date of these loans was further extended with same terms and interest rate for one more year to January 15, 2023. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, these loans totaled $3.2 million, respectively. The loans are secured by a second priority security interest on our headquarters.
On November 25, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, we issued convertible unsecured promissory notes to each of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our largest shareholder (the “Holders”), with a principal sum of $2 million and an annual interest rate of 3.5%. Principal and accrued interest was due on demand by the Holders on and at any time after May 30, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”). The outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest of the Notes may be converted into our Common Stock based on a conversion price of $3 dollars per share, at the option of the Holders any time from the date of the Notes. On May 25, 2020, the Holders each converted $300 thousand of notes into 100,000 shares of our common stock. On May 26, 2021, the Notes were extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and were scheduled to mature on May 30, 2022, and on May 26, 2022, the Notes were further extended with the same terms and interest rate for one year and now mature on May 30, 2023. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the outstanding principal of these notes totaled $1.4 million.
Working Capital
We have incurred significant losses since inception, including net losses attributable to SemiLEDs stockholders of $512 thousand and $518 thousand during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $396 thousand. As of November 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million. We have undertaken actions to decrease losses incurred and implemented cost reduction programs in an effort to transform the Company into a profitable operation. In addition, we are planning to issue additional equity.
On July 6, 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the “Agent”). In accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell from time to time through the Agent our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $20,000,000 (the “Placement Shares”). Sales of the Placement Shares will be made on Nasdaq at market prices by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We agreed to pay a commission to the Agent of 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sale of the Placement Shares sold under the Agreement and reimburse the Agent for certain expenses. During the year ended August 31, 2022, we sold 286,328 shares of common stocks for gross proceeds of $995 thousand with $31 thousand paid as placement agent fees under our ATM program. We did not sell any shares under the ATM program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect to resume sales of Placement Shares after the issuance of the first quarter Form 10-Q.
We estimate that our cash requirements to service debt and contractual obligations in fiscal 2023 is approximately $5.1 million, which we expect to fund through the issuance of additional equity under the ATM program. Based on our current financial projections and assuming the successful implementation of our liquidity plans, we believe that we will have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditure plans for the next 12 months and beyond. The loans with each of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our largest shareholder are expected to be extended upon maturity. However, there can be no assurances that our planned activities will be successful in raising additional capital, reducing losses and preserving cash. If we are not able to generate positive cash flows from operations, we may need to consider alternative financing sources and seek additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources, or refinance our indebtedness, to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to us or that, if available, such financing will be available on terms favorable to us.
25
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our common stock.

Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $396 thousand, and net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2021 was $607 thousand. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $1.0 million, primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and less cash outflow in inventories.
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $63 thousand primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2021 was $31 thousand primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment.
Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was $115 thousand and $130 thousand, respectively, which amounts were primarily for the repayment of long-term debt.
Capital Expenditures
We had capital expenditures of $63 thousand and $31 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our capital expenditures consisted primarily of the purchases of machinery and equipment, construction in progress, prepayments for our manufacturing facilities and prepayments for equipment purchases. We expect to continue investing in capital expenditures in the future as we expand our business operations and invest in such expansion of our production capacity as we deem appropriate under market conditions and customer demand. However, in response to controlling capital costs and maintaining financial flexibility, our management is continuing to monitor prices and, consistent with the existing contractual commitments, may decrease further our activity level and capital expenditures as appropriate.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable.
Item 4. Control s and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, or CEO, and our chief financial officer, or CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of November 30, 2022. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
26
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based upon the aforementioned evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of November 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHE R INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal
Proceedings
Due to the complex technology required to compete successfully in the LED industry, participants in our industry are often engaged in significant intellectual property licensing arrangements, negotiations, disputes and litigation. We are directly or indirectly involved from time to time and may be named in various other claims or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise.
There were no material pending legal proceedings or claims as of November 30, 2022.
Item 1A. R isk Factors
Except as set forth below, there are no material changes related to risk factors from the risk factors described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2022 Annual Report.
The market prices and trading volume of common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our securities to incur substantial losses.
The market prices and trading volume of our shares of common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses. For example, during fiscal 2023 to date, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $2.88 per share on September 9, 2022 to a low of $1.54 per share on December 28, 2022. During fiscal 2023 to date, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 1,000 to 88,500 shares.
We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.
Extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may be the result of strong and substantially increased retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following:
• the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face;
• factors in the public trading market for our common stock include the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging and other trading factors;
• our market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to recent volatility, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuations;
• to the extent volatility in our common stock is caused, as has widely been reported, by a “short squeeze” in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our common stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and
• if the market price of our common stock declines, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them. We cannot assure you that the equity issuance of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future, in which case you could incur substantial losses.
We may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our shares of
28
common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. Overall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, including:
• overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole;
• changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;
• in our growth rate relative to that of our competitors;
• changes in the anticipated future size or growth rate of our addressable markets;
• announcements of new products and services, technological updates or enhancements, or of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or commitments, by us or by our competitors;
• additions or departures of board members, management or key personnel;
• failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
• research or reports that securities analysts or others publish about us or our business;
• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
• lawsuits threatened or filed against us or investigations by governmental authorities;
• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events;
• health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza, and other highly communicable diseases; and
• sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.
