Basis of Presentation The consolidated condensed financial statements of Cintas Corporation (Cintas, the Company, we, us or our) included herein have been prepared by Cintas, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. While we believe that the disclosures are adequately presented, we suggest that these consolidated condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on July 27, 2022. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented beginning on page 41 of that report. There have been no material changes in the accounting policies followed by Cintas during the current fiscal year.
Interim results are subject to variations and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year. In the opinion of management, adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated results of the interim periods shown have been made. Inventories, net are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.
Inventory is comprised of the following:  (In thousands) November 30,
2022 May 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 18,431   $ 19,071   Work in process 48,245   34,280   Finished goods 448,163   418,799     $ 514,839   $ 472,150   Inventories are recorded net of reserves for obsolete inventory (excess and slow-moving) of $ 70.2
million and $ 100.3
million at November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively.
The inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on Cintas' historical rates of obsolescence. Once a specific inventory item is written down to the lower of cost or net realizable value, a new cost basis has been established, and that inventory item cannot subsequently be marked up. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no new accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on Cintas' consolidated condensed financial statements. 9 Table of Contents Note 2 -

entitled Segment Information.
Revenue Recognition Policy Approximately
95 % of the Company's revenue is derived from fees for route servicing of Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and Fire Protection Services operating segment customers, performed by a Cintas employee-partner, at the customer's location of business. Revenue from our route servicing customer contracts represent a single-performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue over time as services are performed, based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method) or at a point in time when the performance obligation under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied, at the customer's location of business. The Company's remaining revenue, primarily within the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, and representing approximately
5 % of the Company's total revenue, is recognized when the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This generally occurs when the goods are transferred to the customer.
Revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are treated as fulfillment activities and are recorded in both revenue and cost of sales at the time control is transferred to the customer. Certain of our customer contracts include pricing terms and conditions that include components of variable consideration. The variable consideration is typically in the form of consideration paid to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract. Specifically, some contracts contain discounts or rebates that the customer can earn through the achievement of specified volume levels. Each component of variable consideration is earned based on the Company's actual performance during the measurement period specified within the contract. To determine the transaction price, the Company estimates the variable consideration using the most likely amount method, based on the specific contract provisions and known performance results during the relevant measurement period. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, the Company considers whether factors outside its control could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal. The Company's performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. No constraints on our revenue recognition were applied during the three or six months ended November 30, 2022 or 2021. The Company reassesses these estimates during each reporting period. Cintas maintains a liability for these discounts and rebates within accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. Variable consideration also includes consideration paid to a customer at the beginning of a contract. Cintas capitalizes this consideration and amortizes it over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue. These assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and in other assets, net on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We determine the allowance for credit losses using both an estimate, based on historical rates of collections, and reserves for specific accounts identified as uncollectible. The portion of the allowance that is an estimate based on Cintas' historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage when the account is current and increasing
10 Table of Contents substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs and collections information and underlying economic expectations. Costs to Obtain a Contract The Company capitalizes commission expenses paid to our employee-partners when the commissions are deemed to be incremental for obtaining the route servicing customer contract. As permitted by Accounting Standards Codification 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", the Company has elected to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations) with similar characteristics because the Company reasonably expects that the effects on the consolidated condensed financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this guidance to the individual contracts within the portfolio. The Company also continues to expense certain costs to obtain a contract if those costs do not meet the criteria of the standard or the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less. The deferred commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit. We review the deferred commission balances for impairment on an ongoing basis. Deferred commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets, net on the Company's consolidated condensed balance sheets. As of November 30, 2022, the current and noncurrent assets related to deferred commissions totaled $ 88.2  million and $ 244.1
million, respectively. As of May 31, 2022, the current and noncurrent assets related to deferred commissions totaled $ 83.7  million and $ 232.2  million, respectively. We recorded amortization expense related to deferred commissions of $ 23.4
million and $ 21.7
million during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization expense related to deferred commissions of $ 45.8
million and $ 43.1
million, respectively. These expenses are classified in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated condensed statements of income.
Note 3 -
Leases Cintas has operating leases for certain operating facilities, vehicles and equipment, which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments over the term of the lease. Each new contract is evaluated to determine if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease. All identified leases are recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheet with a corresponding operating lease right-of-use asset, net, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the operating lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheet.
Operating lease right-of-use assets, net and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of lease payments is determined primarily using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease costs are recorded as incurred. Both lease expense and variable lease costs are primarily recorded in cost of uniform rental and facility services and other on the Company's consolidated condensed statements of income. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
Operating lease costs, including short-term lease expense and variable lease costs which were immaterial in both periods, were $ 20.0

Fair Value Measurements All financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) have been classified within the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the consolidated condensed balance sheet date.
These financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:  As of November 30, 2022 (In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Cash and cash equivalents $ 89,799   $ —   $ —   $ 89,799   Other assets, net:   Interest rate lock agreements —   68,057   —   68,057   Total assets at fair value $ 89,799   $ 68,057   $ —   $ 157,856   As of May 31, 2022 (In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Cash and cash equivalents $ 90,471   $ —   $ —   $ 90,471   Other assets, net: Interest rate lock agreements —   56,877   —   56,877   Total assets at fair value $ 90,471   $ 56,877   $ —   $ 147,348   Cintas’ cash and cash equivalents are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and financial instruments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of financial instruments Cintas classifies within Level 1 include most bank deposits and money market securities. Cintas does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. The fair values of Cintas' interest rate lock agreements are based on similar exchange traded derivatives (market approach) and are, therefore, included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value was determined by comparing the locked rates against the benchmarked treasury rate. No other amounts included in other assets, net, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The methods described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while Cintas believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the consolidated condensed balance sheet dates. In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, Cintas records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required under U.S. GAAP. The assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily relate to assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition. The Company's acquisition of the remaining interest of an equity method investment during fiscal 2022 was recorded at fair value. See

Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $ 50.0

Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $ 50.0
million with a stated interest rate of
3.88 %.
Cintas' senior notes, excluding the G&K senior notes assumed with the acquisition of G&K in fiscal 2017, are recorded at cost, net of debt issuance costs. The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on general market prices. The carrying value and fair value of Cintas' debt as of November 30, 2022 were $ 2,935.2
million and $ 2,876.9
million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2022 were $ 2,811.2
million and $ 2,862.2
million, respectively. During the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, Cintas issued $ 124.0  million and $ 167.0  million, net of commercial paper, respectively. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has a revolving credit facility with a capacity of $ 2.0  billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $ 500.0
million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of November 30, 2022, there was $ 385.2  million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of
4.30 % and maturity dates less than
120
days and
no
borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2022, there was $ 261.2  million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of
1.20 % and maturity dates less than
120
days and
no
borrowings on our revolving credit facility. The fair value of the commercial paper, which approximates carrying value, is estimated using level 2 inputs based on general market prices and interest rates. Cintas uses interest rate locks to manage its overall interest expense as interest rate locks effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances. The interest rate locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable movements in the benchmark treasury rate related to forecasted debt issuances. Cintas used interest rate locks, which represent cash flow hedges, to hedge against movements in the treasury rates at the time Cintas issued its senior notes in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2013, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022. The amortization of the interest rate locks resulted in a decrease to comprehensive income of $ 1.5
million and $ 0.4
million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the amortization of the interest rate locks resulted in a decrease to comprehensive income of $ 3.0
million and $ 0.9
million, respectively.
17 Table of Contents During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, Cintas entered into interest rate lock agreements for forecasted debt issuances. The aggregate notional value of outstanding cash flow hedges was $ 500.0  million at both November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively.
The notional and fair values of the outstanding interest rate locks, for forecasted debt issuances, are summarized as follows: November 30, 2022 May 31, 2022 Fiscal Year of Issuance (in thousands) Other
assets, net Other
assets, net 2022 $ 24,297   $ 18,331   2020 $ 43,760   $ 38,546   The change in fair value of the interest rate locks are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These interest rate locks had no impact on net income or cash flows for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 or 2021.
Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Note 9 -
Income Taxes In the normal course of business, Cintas provides for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest accordingly. As of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, recorded unrecognized tax benefits were $ 26.0
million and $ 30.8
million, respectively, and are included in long-term accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.
The majority of Cintas' operations are in North America. Cintas is required to file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as state income tax returns in a majority of the domestic states and also in certain Canadian provinces. At times, Cintas is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. The audits, by nature, are sometimes complex and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audit could result in either a reduction in Cintas' accruals or an increase in its income tax provision, either of which could have an impact on the consolidated results of operations in any given period. All U.S. federal income tax returns are closed to audit through fiscal 2018. Cintas is currently in various audits in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain domestic states. The years under foreign and domestic state audits cover fiscal years back to 2014. Based on the resolution of the various audits and other potential regulatory developments, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits would not change for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Cintas’ effective tax rate was
22.1 % and
18.0 % for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, Cintas' effective tax rate was
18.4 % and
14.5 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for all periods was impacted by certain discrete items (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation). 18 Table of Contents Note 10 -
Acquisitions On December 10, 2021, Cintas acquired the remaining interest of an equity method investment. The acquisition operates as a component of Cintas' supply chain within the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment. The cash consideration transferred to acquire the remaining interest of the equity method investment was $ 48.0  million, net of cash acquired of $ 1.7  million. Under applicable accounting guidance, the Company was required to record its historical equity method investment at fair value ($ 43.5  million), resulting in a gain of $ 30.2  million, which was recorded as a reduction in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2022. The fair value of the historical equity method investment was determined using a combination of a market and income approach (discounted cash flow analysis). The key assumptions and estimates utilized in these approaches included market data and market multiples, discount rates, as well as future levels of revenue growth and operating margins. The Company believes these assumptions and estimates are reasonable and based on the best information available at the valuation date.
Cintas accounted for the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
The purchase price allocation was determined by management with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists and is based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 10, 2021. During the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, no material adjustments were made to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill are based on several strategic supply chain and synergistic benefits that will allow for Cintas to further vertically integrate the operations for certain product lines, and are expected to be realized from the acquisition.
None
of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.
The final purchase price allocation, including the value of the previously held equity method investment, at fair value is as follows: (In thousands) December 10, 2021 ASSETS Working capital assets $ 17,352   Property and equipment 16,246   Operating lease right-of-use assets 16,882   Goodwill 55,970   Separately identifiable intangible assets 9,201   LIABILITIES Total current liabilities ( 6,425 ) Operating lease liabilities ( 17,734 ) Total allocation (consideration) $ 91,492   The separately identifiable intangible assets are primarily made up of a customer relationship intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of
nine years , which represents the estimated useful life of the economic benefit.
Cintas is required to provide additional disclosures about fair value measurements as part of the consolidated condensed financial statements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (including business combinations). The working capital assets and liabilities, as well as the property and equipment acquired, were valued using Level 2 inputs which included data points that are observable, such as definitive sales agreements, appraisals or established market values of comparable assets (market approach). Goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets were valued using Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable by nature, and included internal estimates of future cash flows (income approach).

Litigation and Other Contingencies Cintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. Cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation discussed below.
The Company is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,
City of Laurel, Mississippi v. Cintas Corporation No. 2 , filed on March 12, 2021. This is a contract dispute whereby plaintiffs allege that Cintas breached its contracts with participating public agencies and seek, among other things, contract-based damages in an unspecified amount.
In March 2022, the District Court denied Cintas’ motion to compel arbitration. Cintas’ appeal from the denial of its motion is pending. Liability in this matter is not probable nor estimable at this time. However, this matter, if decided adversely to Cintas or settled, may result in liability material to Cintas’ consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operation or consolidated cash flows. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.    Results of Operations Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category.

entitled Segment Information of “Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.” Consolidated Results Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended November 30, 2021   Total revenue increased 13.1% to $2,174.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $1,922.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 12.8%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.7% due primarily to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.4% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 23 Table of Contents Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue was $1,710.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $1,535.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year, which was an increase of 11.4%. The organic revenue growth rate for this reportable operating segment was 11.3%. Revenue growth in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was positively impacted by 0.6% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.5% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 20.1% for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, from $387.0 million to $464.9 million. The organic revenue growth rate for other revenue was 19.0%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 1.3% due primarily to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $89.5 million, or 10.9%, for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. This change from the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume, as well as increased energy costs and investments in material cost to support increased revenue growth achieved during the three months ended November 30, 2022. Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms, and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased $25.8 million, or 11.7%, for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily due to increased sales volume in each of the underlying operating segments. Cost of other improved as a percentage of revenue, decreasing from 56.8% for three months ended November 30, 2021 to 52.8% for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The improvement in cost of sales as a percent to revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment as well as i mproved leverage of fixed costs
for both the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $73.6 million, or 14.6%, in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner expenses. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 26.6% for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to 26.2% for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling and administrative expenses increased as a percent to revenue due to employee-partner related expenses, including medical expenses, increasing at a faster rate than revenue growth in the three months ended November 30, 2022. Operating income was $444.9 million, or 20.5% of revenue, for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $381.2 million, or 19.8% of revenue, for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in operating income as a percent of revenue was due to previously mentioned improvements in cost of sales slightly offset by the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.
Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $28.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $21.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The change was primarily due to an increase in interest rates on commercial paper and an increase in outstanding commercial paper during the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. Cintas’ effective tax rate was 22.1% and 18.0% for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation.

Diluted earnings per share were $3.12 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, which was an increase of 13.0% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to the increase in net income combined with the decrease in diluted

Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the six months ended November 30: (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 619,149  $ 593,782  Net cash used in investing activities $ (171,424) $ (151,595) Net cash used in financing activities $ (446,368) $ (819,876) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period $ 89,799  $ 113,170  Cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, include $29.8 million and $64.8 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S.
Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt.
We expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company. Net cash provided by operating activities was $619.1 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $593.8 million for the six months ended November 30, 2021. The change from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital, specifically accounts payable and current income taxes, which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically, accounts receivable and inventories, net which resulted from the growth in revenue. Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments, proceeds from sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $146.4 million and $108.6 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital expenditures in the six months ended November 30, 2022, included $105.7 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $28.0 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. The increase in capital expenditures during the six months ended November 30, 2022 over the same period in the prior fiscal year is due to an investment in the operating segments to support continued market penetration and revenue growth. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses was $15.5 million and $45.7 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The acquisitions during both the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. During the six months ended November 30, 2021, the Company received proceeds of $15.3 million from the sale of certain operating assets, net of cash disposed in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, which is included in All Other.
28 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities also includes $5.2 million and $6.0 million of purchases of investments during the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Net cash used in financing activities was $446.4 million and $819.9 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the decrease in share buyback activity and debt payments partially offset by the increase in dividends paid in the six months ended November 30, 2022.
On October 29, 2019, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. On July 27, 2021, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. From the inception of the July 27, 2021 share buyback program through November 30, 2022, Cintas purchased a total of 2.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $385.62 per share for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion. On July 26, 2022, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date.

During the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, Cintas issued a net $124.0 million and $167.0 million of commercial paper, respectively. On June 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the notes, Cintas paid the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.30%, 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand. The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt:

The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%.
(3)     Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%.
The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has a revolving credit facility with a capacity of $2.0 billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of November 30, 2022, there was $385.2 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.30% and maturity dates less than 120 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2022, there was $261.2 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.20% and maturity dates less than 120 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented.
Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant
30 Table of Contents degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of November 30, 2022, our ratings were as follows: Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term  Debt Standard & Poor’s Stable A-2 A- Moody’s Investors Service Stable P-2 A3 In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit.
