Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1.
Interim Financial Reporting
Nature of business:
Electromed,
Inc. (the “Company”) develops, manufactures and markets innovative airway clearance products that apply High
Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (“HFCWO”) therapy in pulmonary care for patients of all ages. The Company
markets its products in the U.S. to the home health care and institutional markets for use by patients in personal
residences, hospitals and clinics. The Company also sells internationally both directly and through distributors.
International sales were $ 153,000
and $ 236,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Since its
inception, the Company has operated in a single industry segment: developing, manufacturing and marketing medical
equipment.
Impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s
business:
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
Company’s business remains uncertain, and its effects on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part
on future developments, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Such future developments include, but are not limited
to, the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where the Company operates or in which its patients
live, actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the impact on governmental healthcare programs and budgets, the development
and distribution of treatments or vaccines, and the resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty
of the unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation, the Company is unable to predict with confidence the likely impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on its future operations. For a more detailed discussion, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Basis of presentation:
The accompanying
unaudited Condensed Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial statements and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Financial Statements reflect all adjustments
consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results
of operations as required by Regulation S-X. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be achieved for the full year. The financial statements and related notes do not include all information and footnotes required
by U.S. GAAP for annual reports. This interim report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”).
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting
policies follows:
Use of estimates .
Management uses estimates
and assumptions in preparing the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues
and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were used. The Company believes the critical accounting policies
that require the most significant assumptions and judgments in the preparation of its unaudited Condensed Financial Statements
include revenue recognition and the related estimation of variable consideration, inventory valuation, share-based compensation
and warranty reserve.
Net income per common share .
Net income
is presented on a per share basis for both basic and diluted common shares. Basic net income per common share is computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding any restricted stock awards which have not
vested. The diluted net income per common share calculation includes outstanding restricted stock grants and assumes that all stock
options were exercised and converted into common stock at the beginning of the period unless their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Common stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their impact was anti-dilutive were
200,499
and
108,044
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were
206,261
and
112,170
for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Board issued
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments”, which was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, 2019-11,
and 2020-02. The standard introduces new accounting guidance for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, including
trade receivables. This new guidance adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. It
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption
of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

Note 2.
Revenues
Revenue is measured based on consideration specified
in the contract with a customer, adjusted for any applicable estimates of variable consideration and other factors affecting the
transaction price, including consideration paid or payable from customers and significant financing components. Revenue from all
customers is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a distinct good or service to a customer,
as further described below under
Performance obligations and transaction price .
Individual promised goods
and services in a contract are considered a performance obligation and accounted for separately if the individual good or service
is distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available
to the customer and the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the arrangement). If an arrangement includes
multiple performance obligations, the consideration is allocated between the performance obligations in proportion to their estimated
standalone selling price, unless discounts or variable consideration is attributable to one or more but not all the performance
obligations. Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period incurred, unless criteria for capitalization of costs
under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs” (“ASC 340”),
or other applicable guidance are met.
The Company includes shipping and handling
fees in net revenues. Shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of the Company’s SmartVest® Airway Clearance
System (“SmartVest System”) after control has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and
are included in cost of revenues in the Condensed Statements of Operations.
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and
cash collections results in accounts receivable on the Condensed Balance Sheets as further described below under
Accounts receivable
and
Contract assets .

shipment or delivery. Revenues in the Company’s institutional market include revenue recognized at a point in time upon shipment
or delivery as well as revenue recognized over time under operating leases.
6
Performance
obligations and transaction price.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service
to the customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers” (“ASC 606”).
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation in proportion to the standalone selling
price for each and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance
obligations and the timing or method of revenue recognition in each of the Company’s markets are discussed below:
Home
care market .
In the Company’s home care market, its customers are patients who use the SmartVest System. The various
models of the SmartVest System are comprised of three main components – a generator, a vest and a connecting hose –
that are sold together as an integrated unit. Accordingly, in contracts within the home care market, the Company regards the SmartVest
System to be a single performance obligation.
The
Company makes available to its home care patients limited post-sale services that are not material in the context of the contracts,
either individually or taken together, and therefore does not consider them to be performance obligations. The costs associated
with the services are accrued and expensed when the related revenues are recognized. As such, transactions in the home care market
consist of a single performance obligation: the SmartVest System.
Home
care patients generally will rely on third-party payers, including commercial payers and governmental payers such as Medicare,
Medicaid and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the SmartVest System. The
third-party payers’ reimbursement programs fall into three types, distinguished by the differences in the timing of payments
from the payer, consisting of either (i) outright sale, in which payment is received from the payer based on standard terms, (ii)
capped installment sale, under which the SmartVest System is sold for a series of payments that are capped not to exceed a prescribed
or negotiated amount over a period of time or (iii) installment sale, under which the SmartVest System is paid for over a period
of several months as long as the patient continues to use the SmartVest System.
Regardless
of the type of transaction, provided criteria for an enforceable contract are met, it is the Company’s long- standing business
practice to regard all home care agreements as transferring control to the patient upon shipment or delivery, in spite of possible
payment cancellation under government or commercial programs where the payer is controlling the payment over specified time periods.
For home care sales that feature installment payments, the ultimate amount of consideration received from Medicare, Medicaid or
commercial payers can be significantly less than expected if the contract is terminated due to changes in the patient’s
status, including insurance coverage, hospitalization, death or otherwise becoming unable to use the SmartVest System. However,
once delivered to a patient who needs the SmartVest System, the patient is under no obligation to return the SmartVest System
should payments be terminated as a result of the described contingencies. As a result, the Company’s product sales qualify
for point in time revenue recognition. Control transfers to the patient, and revenue is recognized, upon shipment of the SmartVest
System. At this point, physical possession and the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the patient and
either a current or future right to payment is triggered, as further discussed under
Accounts receivable
and
Contract
assets
below.
The
Company’s contractually stated transaction prices in the home care market are generally set by the terms of the contracts
negotiated with insurance companies or by government programs. The transaction price for the Company’s products may be further
impacted by variable consideration. ASC 606 requires the Company to adjust the transaction price at contract inception and throughout
the contract duration for the estimated value of payments to be received from insurance payers based on historical experience
and other available information, subject to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration. Transactions requiring estimates
of variable consideration primarily include (i) capped installment payments, which are subject to the third-party payer’s
termination due to changes in insurance coverage, death or the patient’s discontinued use of the SmartVest System, (ii)
contracts under appeal and (iii) patient responsibility amounts for deductibles, coinsurance, copays and other similar payments.
Although
estimates may be made on a contract-by-contract basis, whenever possible, the Company uses all available information, including
historical collection patterns, to estimate variable consideration for portfolios of contracts. The Company’s estimates
of variable consideration consist of amounts it may receive from insurance providers in excess of its initial revenue estimate
due to patients meeting deductibles or coinsurance during the payment duration, changes to a patient’s insurance status,
changes in an insurance allowable, claims in appeals with Medicare and amounts received directly from patients for their allowable
or coinsurance. The Company believes it has representative historical information to estimate the amount of variable consideration
in relevant portfolios considering the significant experience it has with each portfolio and the similarity of patient accounts
within a portfolio. The analysis includes steps to ensure that revenue recognized on a portfolio basis does not result in a material
difference when compared with an individual contract approach. The Company also leverages its historical experience and all available
relevant information for each portfolio of contracts to minimize the risk its estimates used to arrive at the transaction price
will result in a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the
variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s
judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.
For
example, for contracts in which the Company believes the criteria for reimbursement under government or commercial payer contracts
have been met but for which coverage is unconfirmed or payments are under appeal, the Company has significant observable evidence
of relatively consistent claims recovery experience over the prior three to five years. The Company believes the low volatility
in historical claims approval rates for populations of patients whose demographics are similar to those of current patients provides
reliable predictive value in arriving at estimates of variable consideration in such contracts. Similarly, historical payment
trends for recovery of claims subject to payer installments and payments from patients have remained relatively consistent over
the past five years. No significant changes in patient demographics or other relevant factors have occurred that would limit the
predictive value of such payment trends in estimating variable consideration for current contracts. As a result, the Company believes
its estimates of variable consideration are generally not subject to the risk of significant revenue reversal.
7
For
each type of variable consideration discussed above, there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics with a
wide range of possible transaction prices. For that reason, the Company uses the probability-weighted expected value method provided
under ASC 606 to estimate variable consideration.
The
Company often receives payment from third-party payers for SmartVest System sales over a period of time that may exceed one year.
Despite these extended payment terms, no significant financing component is deemed to exist because the purpose of such terms
is not to provide financing to the patient, the payer or the Company. Rather, the extended payment terms are mandated by the government
or commercial insurance programs; the fundamental purpose of which is to avoid paying the full purchase price of equipment that
may potentially be used by the patient for only a short period of time.
Home
care distributors.
Sales to distributors, who sell direct to patients, are made at fixed contract prices and may include
tiered pricing structures or volume-based rebates which offer more favorable pricing once certain volumes are achieved per the
negotiated contract. The distributor’s purchases accumulate to give the distributor a right to a higher discount on purchases
in excess of the specified level within the contract period. As a result, to the extent the Company expects the distributor to
exceed the specified volume of purchases in the annual period, it recognizes revenue at a blended rate based on estimated total
annual volume and sales revenue. This effectively defers a portion of the transaction price on initial purchases below the specified
volumes for recognition when the higher discount is earned on purchases in excess of specified volumes. Transfer of control of
the products occurs upon shipment or delivery to the distributor, as applicable.
Institutional
market.
The Company’s institutional sales are made to hospitals and home health care centers, pulmonary rehabilitation
centers and other clinics. Sales to these institutions are negotiated with the individual institution or with group purchasing
organizations, with payments received directly from the institution. No insurance reimbursement is involved. Generators are either
sold or leased to the institutions and associated hoses and wraps (used in institutional settings rather than vests) are sold
separately. Accordingly, each product is distinct and considered a separate performance obligation in sales to institutional customers.
The agreements with institutions fall into two main types, distinguished by differences in the timing of transfer of control and
timing of payments:
● Outright
sale – Under these transactions, the Company sells its products for a prescribed
or negotiated price. Transfer of control of the product, and associated revenue recognition,
occurs at the time of shipment and payment is made within normal credit terms, usually
within thirty days.
● Wrap
usage agreements – Under these transactions, the Company provides a generator device
at no cost to the hospital in return for a fixed annual commitment to purchase consumable
wraps. These agreements are cancellable upon at least sixty days prior written notice
by either party. If cancelled, the generator is returned to the Company, where it can
be refurbished and used again at a later date. Revenue for the consumable wraps is recognized
when control transfers to the customer.
International
market.
Sales to international markets are made directly to a number of independent distributors at fixed contract prices
that are not subject to further adjustments for variable consideration. Transfer of control of the products occurs upon shipment
or delivery to the distributor, as applicable.
Product
warranty.
The Company offers warranties on its products. These warranties are assurance-type warranties not sold on a standalone
basis or are otherwise considered immaterial in the context of the contract, and therefore are not considered distinct performance
obligations under ASC 606. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in
the amount of such costs at the time the product is sold.
Accounts
receivable.
The Company’s accounts receivable balance is comprised of amounts due from individuals, institutions and
distributors. Balances due from individuals are typically remitted to the Company by third-party reimbursement agencies such as
Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. Accounts receivable are carried at amounts estimated to be received from patients
under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers. Accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering
a customer’s financial condition and credit history. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible.
8
Contract
assets.
Contract assets include amounts recognized as revenue that are estimates of variable consideration for Medicare appeals
where the final determination of the insurance coverage amount is dependent on future approval of an appeal, or when the consideration
due to the Company is dependent on a future event such as the patient meeting a deductible prior to the Company’s claim
being processed by the payer. Contract assets are classified as current as amounts will turn into accounts receivable and be collected
during the Company’s normal business operating cycle. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the right
to receive payment is unconditional.

Incremental
costs to obtain a contract.
Sales incentives paid to sales representatives are eligible for capitalization as they are incremental
costs that would not have been incurred without entering into a specific sales arrangement and are recoverable through the expected
margin on the transaction. However, the recovery period is less than one year as the performance obligation is satisfied upon
shipment or delivery. Consequently, the Company applies the practical expedient provided by ASC 340 and expenses sales incentives
as incurred. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Statements of Operations.

Warranty Reserve
The
Company provides a lifetime warranty on its products to the prescribed patient for sales within the U.S. and a three-year warranty
for all institutional sales and sales to individuals outside the U.S. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under
its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is shipped. Factors that affect the Company’s
warranty reserve include the number of units shipped, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, the product’s
useful life and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty reserve and adjusts the
amounts as necessary.

Financing Arrangements
The
Company has a credit facility that provides for a $ 2,500,000
revolving line of credit. There was
no
outstanding principal balance
on the line of credit as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit, if any, accrues
at the prime rate ( 7.50 % at December 31, 2022) less
1.00 % and is payable monthly. The amount eligible for borrowing on the line
of credit is limited to the lesser of $ 2,500,000
or
57.00 % of eligible accounts receivable and the line of credit expires on
December
18, 2023 , if not renewed before such date. At December 31, 2022, the maximum $ 2,500,000
was eligible for borrowing. Payment obligations
under the line of credit, if any, are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets
of the Company.
The
documents governing the line of credit contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants that include a minimum tangible net
worth covenant of not less than $ 10,125,000
and restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur certain additional indebtedness
or pay dividends.

Commitments and Contingencies
The
Company is occasionally involved in claims and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company insures certain
business risks where possible to mitigate the financial impact of individual claims and establishes reserves for an estimate of
any probable cost of settlement or other disposition.
On
September 8, 2021, a state court putative class action lawsuit was filed in Minnesota against the Company asserting injury resulting
from the previously announced data breach that impacted the Company’s customer protected health information and employee
personal information and seeking compensatory damages, equitable relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 6, 2021,
the proceeding was removed to the District of Minnesota. The Company believes the plaintiff was not injured as a result of the
data privacy incident and, as a result, the claims are without merit. Accordingly, on November 11, 2021, the Company moved to
dismiss the complaint in its entirety. Prior to the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the parties agreed in principle to settle
the case. The parties have executed a settlement agreement and submitted a motion to settle the class action in the near
future. During January 2023, the settlement was preliminarily approved. The hearing for final approval is scheduled for June 5,
2023. If the court does not grant the approval for settlement, the Company will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. At
this time, the Company is unable to determine the ultimate outcome or potential exposure to loss, if any.
Item
2. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”).
Overview
Electromed,
Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Electromed” or the “Company”) develops and
provides innovative airway clearance products applying High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (“HFCWO”) technologies
in pulmonary care for patients of all ages.
11
We
manufacture, market and sell products that provide HFCWO, including the SmartVest® Airway Clearance System (“SmartVest
System”) that includes our SmartVest SQL® and previous generation SV2100, and related products, to patients with compromised
pulmonary function. The SmartVest SQL is smaller, quieter and lighter than our previous product, with enhanced programmability
and ease of use. Our products are sold in both the home health care market and the institutional market for use by patients in
hospitals, which we refer to as “institutional sales.” The SmartVest SQL has been sold in the domestic home care market
since 2014. In 2015, we launched the SmartVest SQL into institutional and certain international markets. In June 2017, we announced
the launch of the SmartVest SQL with SmartVest Connect™ wireless technology, which allows data connection between physicians
and patients to track therapy performance and collaborate in treatment decisions. SmartVest Connect is currently available to
pediatric and cystic fibrosis patients and was made available to certain targeted adult pulmonary clinics starting in November
2017. Since 2000, we have marketed the SmartVest System and its predecessor products to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis,
bronchiectasis and repeated episodes of pneumonia. Additionally, we offer our products to a patient population that includes neuromuscular
disorders such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), the combination of
emphysema and chronic bronchitis commonly known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), and patients with
post-surgical complications or who are ventilator dependent or have other conditions involving excess secretion and impaired mucus
transport.
In
December 2022, we received 510(k) clearance of our newest generation SmartVest® Clearway® Airway Clearance System
(“Clearway”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and began a limited market release, with the expectation of
a full product launch this year in our third fiscal quarter which ends March 31, 2023.
The
SmartVest System is often eligible for reimbursement from major private insurance providers, health maintenance organizations
(“HMOs”), state Medicaid systems, and the federal Medicare system, which we believe is an important consideration
for patients considering an HFCWO course of therapy. For domestic sales, the SmartVest System may be reimbursed under the Medicare-assigned
billing code (E0483) for HFCWO devices if the patient has cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis (including chronic bronchitis or COPD
that has resulted in a diagnosis of bronchiectasis), or any one of certain enumerated neuromuscular diseases, and can demonstrate
that another less expensive physical or mechanical treatment did not adequately mobilize retained secretions. Private payers consider
a variety of sources, including Medicare, as guidelines in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
For
a description of our critical accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements,
including the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, see Note 1 to our unaudited Condensed
Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 7, and Note 1 to our audited
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022.
Some
of our accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating
financial statements. Such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and are based upon our historical experience,
known trends in our industry, terms of existing contracts, other information from outside sources, as appropriate and other factors.
Therefore, management discusses the development, selection and disclosures with the audit committee. Among other factors, these
judgments are based upon our historical experience, known trends in our industry, terms of existing contracts and other information
from outside sources, as appropriate. We believe the critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates,
assumptions and judgments in the preparation of our financial statements, including the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, include: revenue recognition and the estimation of variable consideration, inventory
valuation, share-based compensation and warranty reserve.
Impacts
of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services designated COVID-19 as a public health emergency. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain,
and its effects on our operational and financial performance will depend in part on future developments, which cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time. Such future developments include, but are not limited to, the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19
pandemic in geographic areas in which we operate or in which our patients live, actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact,
the impact on governmental healthcare programs and budgets, the development and distribution of treatments or vaccines, and the
resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and evolving situation, we are
unable to predict with confidence the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations.
12
We
believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our home care and institutional business will likely continue through the
remainder of fiscal 2023. Our home care and institutional revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared
to the three months ended December 31, 2021; however, if COVID-19 infection rates increase and federal, state and local restrictions
on commerce, stay-at-home orders or other restrictions on businesses are reinstated, we believe that such measures could have
a material adverse effect on our business.
In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. federal government’s declaration of a public health emergency, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) implemented a number of temporary rule changes and waivers to allow prescribers
to best treat patients during the period of the public health emergency. These waivers became effective on March 1, 2020. Clinical
indications and documentation typically required will not be enforced for respiratory-related products, including the SmartVest
System (solely with respect to Medicare patients). The minimum documentation now requires a valid order and documentation of a
respiratory-related diagnosis. Face-to-face and in-person requirements for respiratory devices are being waived while the waiver
is in place. The CMS waiver was recently extended in conjunction with the extension of the federal public health emergency for
an additional 90-day period beginning January 11, 2023.
On
January 30, 2023, the Biden administration announced that the COVID-19 national and public health emergency declarations will
end on May 11, 2023 (the “PHE End Date”), one month after the current PHE was previously set to expire, or April 11,
2023. Without further action from the U.S. federal government, we expect the CMS waiver will terminate no later than the PHE End
Date and we may experience a one-time delay in some percentage of our Medicare net revenue as we expect our average Medicare patient
referral to approval timeframe will extend to pre-COVID-19 pandemic timeframes and referrals with diagnoses not covered pre-COVID-19
pandemic may be cancelled or need to be submitted to CMS for an appeal. We are executing our plans to mitigate the effects on
our net revenue resulting from the likely termination of the CMS waiver by hiring additional employees to increase capacity and
minimize the average timeframe to convert a Medicare patient referral to approval.
Impacts
of Certain Macro-Economic Conditions and the Supply Chain on Our Business and Operations
We
observed increased lead times for certain components in our supply chain and increased material costs and shipping rates during
the second half of fiscal 2022 and into the six months ended December 31, 2022. The changes to our supply chain lead times resulted
in a temporary interruption that impacted product availability for certain customers beginning in September 2022 and continuing
through December 2022. We anticipate that these increased lead times and temporary interruption of supply have the potential to
continue through the second half of fiscal 2023. If we are unable to procure components to meet our demand or if we extend delivery
lead-times to our customers, there may be an adverse impact to our revenue and, longer term, the potential of market share losses.
We are taking actions to expedite components and to identify and qualify alternate suppliers for certain components to minimize
any impact to our revenue and customer deliveries.
We
expect that material costs and shipping rates will remain elevated during the second half of fiscal 2023 relating to supply chain
availability and inflationary trends in electronic components and may extend to other components. In certain instances, we have
purchased key electronic materials in advance to ensure adequate future supply and mitigate the risk of potential supply chain
disruptions. It is possible that these macro-economic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic could have a greater adverse impact
on our supply chain in the future, including impacts associated with preventative and precautionary measures taken by other businesses
and applicable governments. A reduction or further interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse
effect on our business. Any significant increases to our raw material or shipping costs could reduce our gross margins.

Home
care revenue .
Home care revenue increased by $1,328,000, or 14.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022
compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, home care revenue was $20,364,000,
representing an increase of $1,676,000, or 9.0%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in referrals and approvals. The increase in referrals was due to an increase in direct sales representatives and
was offset by a temporary interruption in supply chain and associated operations in the six months ended December 31, 2022.
The
CMS waiver continues to benefit the non-commercial Medicare portion of our home care revenue by increasing the number of referrals
and the approval percentage for non-covered diagnoses. We believe that our ongoing sales team execution, along with the continued
return to pre-COVID-19 levels of patient face-to-face engagement with physicians and clinic access for our sales team, has the
potential to mitigate much of the impact of a CMS waiver expiration.
Home
care distributor revenue .
Home care distributor revenue decreased by $51,000, or 13.2%, for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, home care distributor
revenue was $890,000, an increase of $347,000, or 63.9%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Home care distributor
sales are affected by the timing of distributor purchases that can cause significant fluctuations in reported revenue on a quarterly
basis. The year-to-date revenue increase was due to increased demand from one of our primary home care distribution partners.
Institutional
revenue.
Institutional revenue was $589,000, an increase of $256,000, or 76.9%, for the three months ended December 31,
2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, institutional revenue was $980,000,
an increase of $198,000, or 25.3%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the current year periods was
primarily due to increased capital sales to institutional customers.
International
revenue .
International revenue was $72,000, a decrease of $52,000, or 41.9%, for the three months ended December
31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, international revenue was
$153,000, a decrease of $83,000, or 35.2%, compared to the same period in the prior year.
Gross
profit
Gross
profit increased to $8,682,000, or 74.0% of net revenues, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $7,880,000, or 76.9%
of net revenues, in the same period in the prior year. Gross profit increased to $17,013,000, or 76.0% of net revenues, for the
six months ended December 31, 2022, from $15,581,000, or 76.9% of net revenues, in the same period in the prior year. The decrease
in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increased material
costs and higher shipping expenses to expedite inventory purchases.
Operating
expenses
Selling,
general and administrative expenses.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $7,254,000
and $15,243,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, representing increases of $779,000 and $1,981,000,
or 12.0% and 14.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.
Payroll
and compensation-related expenses were $4,940,000 and $9,884,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
representing increases of $614,000 and $1,292,000, or 14.2% and 15.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior
year. The increase in the current year periods was primarily due to salaries and incentive compensation related to the higher
average number of sales, sales support, marketing, and reimbursement personnel to process higher patient referrals. We have also
continued to provide regular merit-based increases for our employees and are regularly benchmarking our compensation ranges for
new and existing employees to ensure we can hire and retain the talent needed to drive growth in our business. Field sales employees
totaled 57 as of December 31, 2022, 48 of which were direct sales representatives, compared to 48 field sales employees and 39
direct sales representatives as of December 31, 2021.
14
Travel,
meals and entertainment expenses were $719,000 and $1,632,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
representing increases of $102,000 and $371,000, or 16.5% and 29.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.
The increase in the current year periods was due to a higher average number of direct sales representatives as well as increases
in airfare, lodging and inflationary expenses for our annual sales meeting in August 2022.
Total
discretionary marketing expenses were $182,000 and $369,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
representing a decrease of $29,000 and an increase of $4,000, or a decrease of 13.7% and an increase of 1.1%, respectively, compared
to the same periods in the prior year.
Professional
fees were $1,031,000 and $2,462,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, representing increases
of $94,000 and $264,000, or 10.0% and 12.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Professional fees are
primarily for services related to legal costs, shareowner services and reporting requirements, information technology technical
support and consulting fees. The increase in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to nonrecurring legal compliance
fees of approximately $400,000 for a reimbursement-related project offset by a reduction in expenses related to shareholder activism
incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2021, which concluded with a cooperation agreement that became effective
in September 2021.
Research
and development expenses . Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $153,000 and $452,000 for the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, representing decreases of $176,000 and $253,000, or 53.5% and 35.9%, respectively,
compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced professional services costs associated
with our next generation Clearway development. R&D expenses were 1.3% and 2.0% of revenue for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, respectively.
Interest
income, net
Net
interest income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was $7,000 and $11,000, respectively, compared to $6,000
and $15,000, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year.
Income
tax expense
Income
tax expense was estimated at $304,000 and $271,000, and the effective tax rate was 23.7% and 20.4%, for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Estimated income tax expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 includes
a discrete tax expense of $1,000 and a discrete tax benefit of $43,000, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options.
Income
tax expense was estimated at $244,000 and $352,000, and the effective tax rate was 22.6% and 21.6%, for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Estimated income tax expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 includes
a discrete tax benefit of $1,000 and $21,000, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options.
Net
income
Net
income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was $977,000 and $1,058,000, respectively, compared to $838,000 and
$1,277,000 for the same periods in the prior year. The increase in net income in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was
driven primarily by revenue growth while the decrease in net income in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due
to increased SG&A expenses related to our sales and reimbursement investments in revenue growth partially offset by increased
gross profit.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Cash
Flows and Sources of Liquidity
Cash
Flows from Operating Activities
For
six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $330,000. Cash flows provided by operating activities
consisted of net income of $1,058,000, non-cash expenses of $645,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $176,000,
and an increase in income tax payable of $79,000. These cash flows from operating activities were offset by a decrease in accrued
compensation of $532,000, a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $711,000, an increase in accounts receivable
of $503,000, an increase in inventory of $321,000, and an increase in contract assets of $221,000.
15
Cash
Flows from Investing Activities
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $717,000. Cash used in investing activities consisted
of $687,000 primarily related to our enterprise resource planning infrastructure investments and $30,000 in expenditures for intangible
asset costs.
Cash
Flows from Financing Activities
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities was $197,000. Cash used in financing activities consisted
of $153,000 used for our share repurchase program and $60,000 for taxes paid on net share settlement of stock option exercises.
Adequacy
of Capital Resources
Our
primary working capital requirements relate to adding employees to our sales force and support functions, continuing infrastructure
investments, and supporting general corporate needs, including financing equipment purchases and other capital expenditures incurred
in the ordinary course of business. Based on our current operational performance, we believe our working capital of $28,153,000
and available borrowings under our existing credit facility will provide adequate liquidity during fiscal 2023.
Our
credit facility provides us with a revolving line of credit. Interest on borrowings on the line of credit accrues at the prime
rate (7.5% at December 31, 2022) less 1.00% and is payable monthly. There was no outstanding principal balance on the line of
credit as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. The amount eligible for borrowing on the line of credit is limited to the lesser
of $2,500,000 or 57.00% of eligible accounts receivable, and the line of credit expires on December 18, 2023, if not renewed.
As of December 31, 2022, the maximum $2,500,000 was available under the line of credit. Payment obligations under the line of
credit are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
The
documents governing our line of credit contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants that include a minimum tangible net
worth of not less than $10,125,000 and restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or pay dividends.
Any
failure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result
in the lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness, preventing access to additional funds under the line of credit, requiring
prepayment of outstanding indebtedness, or refusing to renew the line of credit. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated
or the line of credit is not renewed, sufficient cash resources to satisfy the debt obligations may not be available and we may
not be able to continue operations as planned. If we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the lender could foreclose on these
assets.
For
the six months ended December 21, 2022 and 2021, we spent $687,000 and $511,000, respectively, on property and equipment. We currently
expect to finance planned equipment purchases with cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. We may
need to incur additional debt if we have an unforeseen need for additional capital equipment or if our operating performance does
not generate adequate cash flows.
While
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors such as inflation are difficult to predict, we believe our cash, cash equivalents
and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, operational cash requirements for
fiscal 2023 and the foreseeable future.  We will continue to evaluate our projected expenditures relative to our available
cash and evaluate financing alternatives in order to satisfy our working capital and other cash requirements.

statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Although we believe these forward-looking statements
are reasonable, they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by
such statements. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results
or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
16
Factors
that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, the following:
● ability
to obtain reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance payers for our
products including potential adverse impact with an expiration of the CMS waiver for
certain respiratory diseases;
● component
or raw material shortages, changes to lead times or significant price increases;
● the
risks associated with our anticipated launch of Clearway;
● adverse
changes to state and federal health care regulations;
● our
ability to maintain regulatory compliance and to gain future regulatory approvals and
clearances;
● entry
of new competitors including new drug or pharmaceutical discoveries;
● adverse
economic and business conditions or intense competition;
● the
risks associated with our planned sales force expansion;
● wage
and component price inflation;
● technical
problems with our research and products;
● the
duration, extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effects on our
business, operations and employees as well as its impact on our customers and distribution
channels and on economies and markets more generally;
● the
risks associated with cyberattacks, data breaches, computer viruses and other similar
security threats;
● changes
affecting the medical device industry;
● our
ability to develop new sales channels for our products such as the home care distributor
channel;
● adverse
international health care regulation impacting current international business;
● our
ability to renew our line of credit or obtain additional credit as necessary; and
● our
ability to protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio.
This
list of factors is not exhaustive, however, and these or other factors, many of which are outside of our control, could have a
material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. Therefore, you should consider these risk factors with caution and
form your own critical and independent conclusions about the likely effect of these risk factors on our future performance. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which the statements are made, and we undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim
any such obligation, to update any forward-looking statement for any reason other than as required by law, even if new information
becomes available or other events occur in the future. You should carefully review the disclosures and the risk factors described
in this and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth herein.
