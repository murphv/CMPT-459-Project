CLEARTRONIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1  - ORGANIZATION
Cleartronic, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Florida on November 15, 1999. All current operations are conducted through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, ReadyOp Communications, Inc. ("ReadyOp"), a Florida corporation incorporated on September 15, 2014. ReadyOp facilitates the marketing and sales of subscriptions to the ReadyOp™ and ReadyMed ™ platforms and the AudioMate IP gateways discussed below.
NOTE 2  - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements contain the consolidated accounts of Cleartronic, Inc. and its subsidiary, ReadyOp Communications, Inc. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The unaudited interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the dates and periods presented and to make such information not misleading.
These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, contained in our General Form for Registration of Securities of Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on December 29, 2022. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other interim period or the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.
USE OF ESTIMATES
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and operations for the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
Significant estimates include the assumptions used in valuation of deferred tax assets, estimated useful life of property and equipment, valuation of inventory and allowance for doubtful accounts.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company did not own any cash equivalents on December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a periodic review and analysis of outstanding accounts receivable balances. Uncollectible receivables are charged to the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are used to credit the allowance account in the periods in which the recoveries are made. When a client is invoiced, the amount is recorded as an asset in Accounts Receivable and as Deferred Revenue in Current Liabilities. When payment is received the amount is moved to Cash on the balance sheet and Accounts Receivables are reduced. The amount listed as Deferred Revenue is amortized monthly over the license period.
The Company provided $ 18,000
and $ 18,000
for allowances of doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS
Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of deferred subscriber costs and prepaid expenses. Deferred subscriber costs totaling $ 25,500
and $ 38,250
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Prepaid expenses totaling $ 25,667
and $ 18,165
at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively are primarily for insurance and other items
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the underlying lease term for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter or when the property and equipment is put into service.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company currently maintains cash balances at one FDIC-insured banking institution. Deposits held in non interest-bearing transaction accounts are insured up to a maximum of $ 250,000
at all FDIC-insured institutions. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 15,720
and $ 208,135 , respectively, in excess of FDIC insurance limits.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 21,815
and $ 49,260
respectively, in research and development costs.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUES
The Company revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company has transferred promised goods and services to the customer and in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
i. Identification of Contact with a customer;
ii. Identify the performance obligation of the contract
iii. Determine transaction price;
iv. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
v. Recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
-6-
The Company generates revenue primarily through the sale of integrated hardware and software licenses. The portion of the contract that is associated with ongoing hosting and related customer service is amortized monthly over the license period. The Company incurs certain incremental contract costs (referred to as deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net) including selling expenses (primarily commissions) related to acquiring customers. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net are included in prepaid and expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Commissions paid in connection with acquiring new customers are determined based on the value of the contractual fees. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred on the date the revenue associated with the cost is recognized. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, the Company recorded $ 25,500
and $ 38,250 , respectively, in deferred subscriber costs, which are included as a component of prepaid expense.
In transactions in which hardware is sold to a customer, the Company recognizes the revenue when the hardware has been shipped to the customer. The hardware supplied by the Company does not require a related software license and can be operated and fully functional without the Company's software.
From time to time clients request special training meetings. We send employees to these meeting and charge our clients on a per diem basis. These charges are recorded as consulting fees on our income statement.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative stand alone selling price. Revenue associated with the sale and installation of system licenses is recognized once installation is complete.
Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are provided. These fees are recorded as current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as the Company expects to satisfy any remaining performance obligations as well as recognize the related revenue within the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has applied the practical expedient regarding deferred revenue to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations if (i) the contract has an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, the Company recorded $ 901,872
and $ 1,125,511 , respectively, in deferred revenue.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share ("EPS") are the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by adding both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.
Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260–10–55–23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no options and warrants outstanding.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had
512,996
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock outstanding, which are convertible into

ASC 820 defines "fair value" as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There was no impact relating to the adoption of ASC 820 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
- Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.
- Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- Level 3: Inputs that are generally observable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. It is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.
INVENTORY
Inventory consists of components held for assembly and finished goods held for resale or to be utilized for installation in projects. Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company's policy is to record a reserve for technological obsolescence or slow-moving inventory items. The Company only carries finished goods to be shipped along with completed circuit boards and parts necessary for final assembly of finished product. All existing inventory is considered current and usable. The Company recorded no reserve for obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
At December 31, 2022 inventory was $ 21,097
of raw materials and $ 0
of finished goods.
At September 30, 2022, inventory was $ 21,097
of raw materials and $ 0
of finished goods.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company had advertising costs of $ 13,149
and $ 5,025
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
All newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
LEASE ACCOUNTING
We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets on the balance sheet for most operating leases. We made the accounting policy election not to apply the recognition provisions of ASC 842 to short-term leases which are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, we recognize the lease payments for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease liabilities reflect our obligation to make future lease payments for real estate locations. Lease terms are comprised of contractual terms. Payments are discounted using the rate we would pay to borrow amounts equal to the lease payments over the lease term (our incremental borrowing rate). We do not separate lease and non-lease components for contracts in which we are the lessee. ROU assets are measured based on lease liabilities adjusted for incentives and timing differences between operating lease expense and payments, recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are recognized as incurred. Common area maintenance and other executory costs are the main components of variable lease payments. Operating and variable lease expenses are recorded in general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Major Supplier and Sole Manufacturing Source
The Company relies on no major supplier for its products.

Interruption of adequate supply of components, primarily computer chips, to the manufacturing source presents additional risk to the Company. The Company believes that additional commercial facilities exist at competitive rates to match the resources and capabilities of its existing manufacturing source, but the current worldwide shortage of computer chips does limit our ability to supply our proprietary radio gateways to clients and other buyers .

ReadyOp is offered as a software as a service (SAAS) program on an annual contract basis although an increasing number of clients have requested multi-year agreements.
In March 2018, the Company approved the spin-off of VoiceInterop, Inc. ("Voiceinterop"), one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, into a separate company under a Form S-1 registration filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
In October 2019, the Company acquired the ReadyMed software platform from Collabria LLC. ReadyMed is a web-based secure communications platform initially designed for the healthcare industry. This includes hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, health insurance companies, workers compensation insurance companies and many other segments of the healthcare industry. The platform provides caregivers with patient tracking capability and allows physicians and other healthcare entities to track patient progress after medical treatment and/or release from hospital care. The software also enables monitoring and reporting of patients in medium and long-term care. Additionally, the platform provides secure communications capabilities and record keeping to track the healing process of patients, record their recovery and monitor their medications. ReadyMed
has
proved beneficial for multiple clients in the healthcare industry due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company offers both the ReadyOp and ReadyMed capabilities to clients and usually refers to the platform as ReadyOp to avoid confusion in the marketplace of two products.

Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
An evaluation was conducted by the registrant's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the registrant's controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the registrant files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
Change in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a–15 or Rule 15d–15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Cleartronic is not engaged in any litigation at the present time and management is unaware of any claims or complaints that could result in future litigation. Management will seek to minimize disputes with the Company's customers but recognizes the inevitability of legal action in today's business environment as an unfortunate price of conducting business.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
The registrant claimed exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the securities pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof in as much as no public offering was involved.

Each of the purchasers was, at the time of the purchaser's respective purchase, an accredited investor, as that term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 and had access to sufficient information concerning the registrant and the offering.
