ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CSW Industrials, Inc. (“CSWI,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a diversified industrial growth company with a strategic focus on providing niche, value-added products in the end markets we serve.
Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration ("HVAC/R"), plumbing products, grilles, registers and diffusers ("GRD"), building safety solutions and high-performance specialty lubricants and sealants.
End markets that we serve include HVAC/R, architecturally-specified building products, plumbing, energy, rail, mining and general industrial.
Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and Vietnam, and we have distribution operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).
Our products are sold directly to end users or through designated channels in over
100
countries around the world, primarily including Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. Many of our products are used to protect the capital assets of our customers that are expensive to repair or replace and are critical to their operations.
We have a source of recurring revenue from the maintenance, repair, overhaul and consumable nature of many of our products.
We also provide some custom engineered products that strengthen and enhance our customer relationships.
The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than
100
well-respected brand names, such as RectorSeal No. 5®, Kopr-Kote®, KATS Coatings®, Safe-T-Switch®, Air Sentry®, Big Red®, Cover Guard TM , AC Guard TM , Deacon®, Leak Freeze®, Falcon Stainless, Inc.®, Greco®, TRUaire® and Shoemaker Manufacturing®. During the three and nine months of our prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had direct and indirect impacts on our operations including reduced production activities at our Vietnam operations, material and freight cost inflation, supply chain disruptions and freight delays, driven by numerous factors including government actions, labor supply shortages and recovering demand.
In addition, COVID-19 and its indirect effects also contributed to increased demand in certain parts of our business, including the HVAC/R end market.
During the three and nine months of our current fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our consolidated operating results were immaterial as economic activities recovered and the effects of the pandemic lessened.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers, the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions are impacted.
Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. We are closely monitoring the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global impacts.
We have no operations, employees or assets in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, nor do we source goods or services of any material amount from those countries, whether directly or indirectly.
Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, we indefinitely suspended all commercial activities in Russia.
Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we had no sales into Belarus or Ukraine.
While the conflict continues to evolve and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not currently believe the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on our business and results of operations.
However, if the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater global economic or political disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted as a result. 7 Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022 (“Quarterly Report”), include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities directly attributable to CSWI and have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The condensed consolidated financial statements are for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, except our 50% investment in a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have consolidated into our financial statements.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of CSWI’s financial position as of December 31, 2022, and the results of operations for the three and
nine months periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.
The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in CSWI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”). Accounting Policies We have consistently applied the accounting policies described in our Annual Report in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements.   Accounting Developments Pronouncements Implemented In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2021-08, "Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers." This update improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired customer revenue contracts at the date of and after a business combination. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company early adopted the ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis on April 1, 2022 and did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 16, 2022, The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA") was signed into law effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022.
The bill was meant to address the high inflation rate in the U.S. through various climate, energy, healthcare, and other incentives.
These incentives are meant to be paid for by the tax provisions included in the IRA, such as a new fifteen percent corporate minimum tax, a one percent new excise tax on stock buybacks, additional IRS funding to improve taxpayer compliance, and others.
At this time, none of the IRA tax provisions are expected to have a material impact to the Company's fiscal 2023 tax provision.
The Company will continue to monitor for updates to the Company's business along with guidance issued with respect to the IRA to determine whether any adjustments are needed to the Company's tax provision in future periods. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting." This update provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease potential accounting impacts associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as interbank offered rates and London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").
This ASU includes practical expedients for contract modifications due to reference rate reform.
Generally, contract modifications related to reference rate reform may be considered an event that does not require remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination at the modification date.
This ASU is effective for all entities through December 31, 2022.
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 to defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.
As discussed in Note 9, the Company terminated our interest rate swap agreement in January 2023 and therefore, will not apply the practical expedients and exceptions as required by the ASU.
As discussed in Note 7, the Company’s Second Amendment includes a transition clause in the event LIBOR is discontinued, as such, we do not expect the transition of LIBOR to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 8 2.
ACQUISITIONS Shoemaker Manufacturing, LLC On December 15, 2021, we acquired
100 % of outstanding equity of Shoemaker Manufacturing, LLC (“Shoemaker”), based in Cle Elum, Washington, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 43.6  million, including working capital and closing cash adjustments and contingent consideration.
Shoemaker offers high-quality customizable GRD for commercial and residential markets, and expands CSWI’s HVAC/R product offering and regional exposure in the northwest U.S.
The aggregate purchase price was comprised of cash consideration of $ 38.6  million (including $ 1.2  million cash acquired),
25,483
shares of the Company's common stock valued at $ 3.0  million at transaction close and additional contingent consideration of
$ 2.0  million based on Shoemaker meeting a defined financial target during the quarter ended March 31, 2022.
The cash consideration was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in note 7).
The
25,483
shares of common stock delivered to the sellers as consideration were issued from treasury shares.
As of the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was classified as a current liability of $ 2.0  million and was determined using a scenario-based analysis on forecasted future results.
In May 2022, the full contingent consideration amount of $ 2.0  million was remitted to the sellers due to the performance obligation being met. The Shoemaker acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations ("Topic 805").
The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair value of the identifiable assets acquired was $ 8.1  million allocated to goodwill, which represents the value expected to be obtained from owning a more extensive GRD product portfolio for the HVAC/R market and increased regional exposure to the northwest U.S.
The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the net assets acquired included customer lists ($ 23.0  million), trademarks ($ 6.5  million), noncompete agreements ($ 0.7  million), backlog ($ 0.3  million), inventory ($ 3.6  million), accounts receivable ($ 1.7  million), cash ($ 1.2  million), equipment ($ 1.4  million) and prepaid expenses ($ 0.2  million), net of current liabilities ($ 3.1  million).
Customer lists, noncompete agreements and backlog are being amortized over  15
years,
5
years and
1
month, respectively, while trademarks and goodwill are not being amortized.  The Company completed the analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Goodwill and all intangible assets, including customer lists, trademarks, noncompete agreements and backlog are deductible and amortized over
15
years for income tax purposes.
Shoemaker activity has been included in our Contractor Solutions segment since the acquisition date.
No pro forma information has been provided due to immateriality. Cover Guard, Inc. and AC Guard, Inc.
On July 8, 2022, we acquired the assets of Cover Guard, Inc. (“CG”) and AC Guard, Inc. ("ACG"), based in Orlando, Florida, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 18.4  million, comprised of cash consideration of $ 18.0  million and additional contingent considerations initially measured at $ 0.4  million based on CG and ACG meeting defined financial targets over a period of
5
years.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we agreed to pay an additional $ 3.7  million, comprised of cash consideration of $ 1.5  million and
5-year
annuity payments (value of $ 2.2  million) to a third party to secure the related intellectual property.
The total cash consideration at closing of $ 19.5  million was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in footnote 7).
CG and ACG product lines further expand Contractor Solutions’ offering of leading HVAC/R accessories.
Through these differentiated products, our Contractor Solutions segment expects to achieve incremental ductless and ducted HVAC/R market penetration.
As of the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was classified as a long term liability of $ 0.4  million and was determined using an option pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations.
The CG and ACG acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under Topic 805.
The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair value of the identifiable assets acquired was $ 1.7  million allocated to goodwill, which represents the value expected to be obtained from owning products that are complementary to our existing HVAC/R and plumbing offerings and provide a meaningful value proposition to our end use customers.
The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the assets acquired included customer lists ($ 9.8  million), patent ($ 1.8  million), trademarks ($ 0.7  million), inventory ($ 3.1  million), accounts receivable ($ 1.0  million) and equipment ($ 0.3  million).
Customer lists and patent are being amortized over  15
years and
10
years, respectively, while trademarks and goodwill are not being amortized.  The Company's evaluation of the facts and circumstances available as of July 8, 2022, to assign fair values to assets acquired is ongoing.
We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Goodwill and
9 all intangible assets, including customer lists, trademarks and patent are deductible and amortized over
15
years for income tax purposes.
CG and ACG activity has been included in our Contractor Solutions segment since the acquisition date.
No pro forma information has been provided due to immateriality. The additional $ 3.7  million we agreed to pay a third party was accounted for as an acquisition of intellectual property and will be amortized over
15
years. Falcon Stainless, Inc. On October 4, 2022, we acquired
100 % of the outstanding equity of Falcon Stainless, Inc ("Falcon"), based in Temecula, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 37.1  million (including $ 1.0  million cash acquired), comprising cash consideration of $ 34.6  million and an additional payment of $ 2.5  million due
one-year
from the acquisition date assuming certain business conditions are met.
The cash consideration was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in footnote 7).
Falcon products are well-known among the professional trades for supplying enhanced water flow delivery and increased customer satisfaction and supplement our Contractor Solutions segment's existing product portfolio.
The Falcon acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under Topic 805.
The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair value of the identifiable assets acquired was $ 18.2  million allocated to goodwill, which represents the value expected to be obtained from owning products that are complementary to our existing plumbing offerings and provide a meaningful value proposition to our end use customers.
The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the assets acquired comprises customer lists ($ 17.7  million), trademarks ($ 4.7  million), accounts receivable ($ 1.4  million), cash ($ 1.0  million), inventory ($ 0.7  million), other current asset ($ 0.1  million) and other assets ($ 2.9  million), net of current liabilities ( 0.5  million) and other liabilities ($ 9.1  million).

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Whitmore Joint Venture On April 1, 2021, Whitmore Manufacturing, LLC (“Whitmore”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSWI, completed the formation of the joint venture (the "Whitmore JV") with Pennzoil-Quaker State Company dba SOPUS Products (“Shell”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company that comprises Shell’s U.S. lubricants business.
The formation was consummated through a transaction in which Whitmore sold to Shell a
50 % interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary (containing certain existing operating assets) in exchange for consideration of $ 13.4  million from Shell in the form of cash ($ 5.3  million) and intangible assets ($ 8.1  million).
The Whitmore JV has been consolidated into the operations of the Company and its activity has been included in our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment since the formation date. The Whitmore JV is deemed to be a VIE as the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
The major factor that led to the conclusion that the Company is the primary beneficiary of this VIE is that Whitmore has the power to direct the most significant activities due to its ability to direct the manufacturing decisions of the Whitmore JV.
Whitmore JV's total net assets are presented below (in thousands): 10 December 31, 2022 Cash $ 4,128   Accounts receivable, net 6,783   Inventories, net 2,990   Prepaid expenses and other current assets 202   Property, plant and equipment, net 10,638   Intangible assets, net 6,681   Other assets 76   Total assets $ 31,498   Accounts payable $ 2,980   Accrued and other current liabilities 1,798   Other long-term liabilities 5   Total liabilities $ 4,783   During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Whitmore JV generated net (loss) income of $( 0.2 ) million and $ 0.2  million, respectively. The Whitmore JV's LLC Agreement contains a put option that gives either member the right to sell its
50 % equity interest in the Whitmore JV to the other member at a dollar amount equivalent to
90 % of the initiating member's equity interest determined based on the fair market value of the Whitmore JV's net assets.
This put option can be exercised, at either member's discretion, by providing written notice to the other member after
three years
from the Whitmore JV's formation, subject to certain timing restrictions.
This redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at the higher of the redemption value or carrying value each reporting period.

(b) Represents the unhedged interest rate according to the Whitmore Term Loan agreement. Revolving Credit Facility As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report, prior to May 2021, we maintained a
five-year , $ 300.0
million revolving credit facility agreement (the "First Credit Agreement"), which was scheduled to mature on September 15, 2022.
Borrowings in the U.S. under this facility bore interest at a rate of prime plus between
0.25 % to
1.5 % or LIBOR plus between
1.25 % to
2.5 % based on our quarterly leverage ratio.
We also paid a commitment fee between
0.15 % to
0.4 % for the unutilized portion of this facility.
On May 18, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second Credit Agreement”), which replaced the First Credit Agreement and provides for a $ 400  million revolving credit facility that contains a $ 25  million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 10  million sublimit for swingline loans, with an additional $ 150  million accordion feature.
The Second Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on May 18, 2026.
The Company incurred a total of $ 2.3
million in underwriting fees, which are being amortized over the life of the Second Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Second Credit Agreement bear interest at either base rate plus between
0.25 % to
1.5 % or LIBOR plus between
1.25 % to
2.5 %, based on the Company’s leverage ratio calculated on a quarterly basis.
The base rate is described in the Second Credit Agreement as the highest of (i) the Federal funds effective rate plus
0.50 %, (ii) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus
1.00 %.
We pay a commitment fee between
0.15 % to
0.4 % based on the Company's leverage ratio for the unutilized portion of this facility.
Interest and commitment fees are payable at least quarterly and the outstanding principal balance is due at the maturity date.
The Second Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all tangible and intangible assets and stock issued by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, and
65 % of the voting equity interests in its first-tier foreign subsidiaries.
On December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 to the Second Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to utilize a portion of the accordion feature, thus increasing the commitment from $ 400.0  million to $ 500.0  million, and concurrently reduced the available incremental accordion by a corresponding amount (the term "Revolving Credit Facility" as used throughout this document refers to the First Credit Agreement, the Second Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment, as applicable).
The Second Amendment also replaced the LIBOR Rate with individualized metrics based on the specific denomination of borrowings, including a metric based on Term SOFR (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement) for borrowings denominated in U.S. Dol lars.
The Company incurred a total of $ 0.7
million in underwriting fees, which are being amortized over the remaining term of the Second Credit Agreement. 14 During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed $ 122.8
million and repaid $ 98.6
million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had $ 267.2
million and $ 243.0
million, respectively, in our outstanding balance, which resulted in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $ 232.8
million and $ 157.0
million, respectively.
The financial covenants contained in the Second Credit Agreement require the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of
3.00
to 1.00, subject to a temporary increase to
3.75
to 1.00 for 18 months following the consummation of permitted acquisitions with consideration in excess of certain threshold amounts set forth in the Second Credit Agreement.
The Second Credit Agreement also requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of
1.25
to 1.00, the calculations and terms of which are defined in the Second Credit Agreement.
Covenant compliance is tested quarterly, and we were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022.
Whitmore Term Loan
In July 2014, Whitmore secured a term loan (the "Whitmore Term Loan") related to a warehouse and corporate office building and the remodel of an existing manufacturing and research and development facility.  The Whitmore Term Loan matures on July 31, 2029 and requires payments of $ 140,000
each quarter.  Borrowings under this term loan bear interest at a rate of one month LIBOR plus
2.0 %.  As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, Whitmore Manufacturing had $ 9.4
million and $ 9.8
million, respectively, in principal amount outstanding under the Whitmore Term Loan.
As described in Note 9, interest payments under the Whitmore Term Loan were hedged under an interest rate swap agreement until January 9, 2023, when the interest rate swap agreement was terminated.
On January 20, 2023, the Whitmore Term Loan was paid off using borrowings under our existing Revolving Credit Facility discussed above. 8.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING As of December 31, 2022, we had an interest rate swap agreement to hedge exposure to variable interest rates on the Whitmore Term Loan, as discussed in Note 7.  As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had $ 9.4
million and $ 9.8
million, respectively, of notional amount outstanding designated as an interest rate swap with third parties.  The interest rate swap was highly effective.  As of December 31, 2022, the derivative assets were reported in current derivative assets as the interest rate swap was terminated on January 9, 2023, which resulted a cash receipt of $ 0.2  million.
The fair value of the interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument is summarized below (in thousands): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Current derivative asset $ 379   $ —   Current derivative liabilities —   109   Non-current derivative liabilities —   233   The impact of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is included in Note 16.

per share quarterly rate or otherwise will be reviewed individually and declared by our Board of Directors in its discretion.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of the interest rate swap contract (as discussed in Note 9) is determined using Level 2 inputs.  The carrying value of our debt (discussed in Note 7) approximates fair value as it bears interest at variable rates.  The carrying amounts of other financial instruments (i.e., cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable) approximate their fair values at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 due to their short-term nature. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at the higher of the redemption value or carrying value each reporting period.
The redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires management judgment with respect to future revenue, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates and is classified as Level III under the fair value hierarchy.
The redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is discussed in Note 3. 13.
RETIREMENT PLANS
Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report for a description of our retirement and postretirement benefits. The following tables set forth the combined net pension benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all plans (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service and other costs
$ 15   $ 12   $ 45   $ 36   Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 36   34   107   101   Expected return on assets ( 11 ) ( 28 ) ( 34 ) ( 84 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 11   18   32   53   Pension plan termination 453   $ —   $ 453   $ —   Net pension benefit $ 504   $ 36   $ 603   $ 106   The components of net periodic cost for retirement and postretirement benefits, other than service and other costs, are included in other expense, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we offered lump sum payments to eligible active and terminated vested participants in our Canadian defined benefit pension plan (the “Canadian Plan”) that covers all of our employees based at our facility in Alberta, Canada.
Approximately
50 % of those participants accepted the lump sum offer for an aggregate payment of $ 0.7  million in November 2022.
We entered into an annuity purchase contract for the remaining liability and terminated the Canadian Plan effective January 31, 2022.
The termination required an additional contribution of $ 0.1  million, which was paid in November 2022, and resulted in an overall termination charge of $ 0.5  million ($ 0.4  million, net of tax) recorded in other (expense) income, net, due primarily to the recognition of expenses that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recognition of additional costs associated with the annuity purchase contract.

CONTINGENCIES From time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business.  There are no matters pending, whether individually or in the aggregate, that we currently believe have a reasonable possibility of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 15.
INCOME TAXES For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we earned $ 18.2
million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $ 2.7
million, resulting in an effective tax rate of
14.7 %.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we earned $ 89.7
million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $ 20.2
million, resulting in an effective tax rate of
22.6 %.
The provision for income taxes differed from the statutory rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a net decrease in the reserves for uncertain tax positions ("UTP"), excess tax deductions related to stock compensation, excess tax deductions related to Foreign-derived intangible income ("FDII") and the impact of US federal provision to return adjustment, partially offset by state income tax, net of federal benefit and executive compensation limitations.
In connection with the TRUaire acquisition closed in December 2020, the Company recognized a UTP of $ 17.3  million related to pre-acquisition tax periods.
In addition, in accordance with the tax indemnification included in the purchase agreement, the seller provided a contractual indemnification to the Company for up to $ 12.5  million related to UTPs taken in pre-acquisition years and we recognized a tax indemnification asset of $ 12.5  million.
This tax indemnification asset will either be settled or expire by December 2023.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, as a result of the audit closure of a pre-acquisition tax period for TRUaire, $ 5.0  million of the tax indemnification asset was released along with the relevant UTP of $ 5.3  million.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, TRUaire's Vietnam entity concluded its audit for the tax periods from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2022 and received an audit closing letter from the tax authority.
As a result, $ 1.5  million of the UTP accrual (including penalties and interests accrued post-acquisition) was released and recorded as an income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.5  million of the tax indemnification asset remains outstanding and is reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we earned $ 12.1
million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $ 2.4
million, resulting in an effective tax rate of
19.7 %.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we earned $ 63.9
million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $ 15.1
million, resulting in an effective tax rate of
23.6 %.
The provision for income taxes differed from the statutory rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to excess tax deductions related to stock compensation, the impact of federal return to provision adjustments and deductions related to FDII, partially offset by state and foreign income taxes, executive compensation limitations, an increase in the reserve for UTP and foreign tax credits. One
of our Canadian subsidiaries is currently under audit by the taxing authority for tax periods from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2020. 19 16.

Unrealized gain (loss) is reclassified to earnings as underlying cash interest payments are made.
As discussed in Note 9, the interest rate swap was terminated on January 9, 2023, which resulted a gain of $ 0.1  million, net of deferred taxes, during the three months ended March 31, 2023. (b)
Amortization of actuarial gains (losses) out of accumulated comprehensive loss are included in the computation of net periodic pension expense.

SEGMENTS During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we revised our segment structure to align with how our chief operating decision maker (who was determined to be our Chief Executive Officer) views our business, assesses performance and allocates resources to our business components.
Effective April 1, 2021, following the completion of various strategic transactions including the acquisition of TRUaire and the formation of the Whitmore JV, our business is organized into
three
reportable segments:
• Contractor Solutions • Engineered Building Solutions • Specialized Reliability Solutions The following is a summary of the financial information of our reporting segments reconciled to the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands).
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022: (in thousands) Contractor Solutions Engineered Building Solutions Specialized Reliability Solutions Subtotal - Reportable Segments Eliminations and Other Total Revenues, net to external customers $ 110,171   $ 24,619   $ 36,303   $ 171,093   $ —   $ 171,093   Intersegment revenue 1,736   —   32   1,768   ( 1,768 ) —  Operating income 21,829   2,257   3,921   28,007   ( 4,895 ) 23,112   21 Three Months Ended December 31, 2021*: (in thousands) Contractor Solutions Engineered Building Solutions Specialized Reliability Solutions Subtotal - Reportable Segments Eliminations and Other Total Revenues, net to external customers $ 81,005   $ 23,905   $ 31,376   $ 136,286   $ —   $ 136,286   Intersegment revenue 1,454   —   8   1,462   ( 1,462 ) —  Operating income 11,324   3,200   3,384   17,908   ( 4,459 ) 13,449   Nine months ended December 31, 2022: (in thousands) Contractor Solutions Engineered Building Solutions Specialized Reliability Solutions Subtotal - Reportable Segments Eliminations and Other Total Revenues, net to external customers $ 374,377   $ 78,978   $ 108,864   $ 562,219   $ —   $ 562,219   Intersegment revenue 5,454   —   95   5,549   ( 5,549 ) —  Operating income 90,416   10,172   13,658   114,246   ( 14,944 ) 99,302   Nine months ended December 31, 2021*: (in thousands) Contractor Solutions Engineered Building Solutions Specialized Reliability Solutions Subtotal - Reportable Segments Eliminations and Other Total Revenues, net to external customers $ 294,538   $ 73,389   $ 85,209   $ 453,136   $ —   $ 453,136   Intersegment revenue 1,510   —   80   1,590   ( 1,590 ) —  Operating income 67,589   9,388   5,290   82,267   ( 13,824 ) 68,443   *Prior period has been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 22 Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our operations financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report, as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations relating to future events and our future performance that involve risks and uncertainties.
See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risk factors set forth in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report. Overview
CSWI is a diversified industrial growth company with a strategic focus on providing niche, value-added products in the end markets we serve.
Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration ("HVAC/R"), plumbing products, grilles, registers and diffusers ("GRD"), building safety solutions and high-performance specialty lubricants and sealants.
End markets that we serve include HVAC/R, architecturally-specified building products, plumbing, energy, rail, mining and general industrial.
Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and Vietnam, and we have distribution operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).
Our products are sold directly to end users or through designated channels in over 100 countries around the world, primarily including Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. Many of our products are used to protect the capital assets of our customers that are expensive to repair or replace and are critical to their operations.
We have a source of recurring revenue from the maintenance, repair and overhaul and consumable nature of many of our products.
We also provide some custom engineered products that strengthen and enhance our customer relationships.
The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 100 well-respected brand names, such as RectorSeal No. 5®, Kopr-Kote®, KATS Coatings®, Safe-T-Switch®, Air Sentry®, Big Red®, Cover Guard TM , AC Guard TM , Deacon®, Leak Freeze®, Falcon Stainless, Inc.®, Greco®, TRUaire® and Shoemaker Manufacturing®. We operate in three business segments: Contractor Solutions, Engineered Building Solutions and Specialized Reliability Solutions.
Our Contractor Solutions segment manufactures efficiency and performance enhancing products predominantly for residential and commercial HVAC/R and plumbing applications, which are designed primarily for professional end-use customers.
Our Engineered Building Solutions segment provides primarily code-driven, life-safety products that are engineered to provide aesthetically-pleasing solutions for the construction, refurbishment and modernization of commercial, institutional and multi-family residential buildings.
Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment provides products for increasing reliability, efficiency, performance and lifespan of industrial assets and solving equipment maintenance challenges.
We believe that our broad portfolio of products and markets served, as well as our brand recognition, will continue to provide opportunities; however, we face ongoing challenges affecting many companies, such as environmental and other regulatory compliance, combined with overall global economic uncertainty.
During the three and nine months of our prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had direct and indirect impacts on our operations including reduced production activities at our Vietnam operations, material and freight cost inflation, supply chain disruptions and freight delays, driven by numerous factors including government actions, labor supply shortages and recovering demand.
In addition, COVID-19 and its indirect effects also contributed to increased demand in certain parts of our business, including the HVAC/R end market.
During the three and nine months of our current fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our consolidated operating results were immaterial as economic activities recovered and the effects of the pandemic lessened.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers, the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions are impacted.
Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. We are closely monitoring the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global impacts.
We have no operations, employees or assets in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, nor do we source goods or services of any material amount from those countries, whether directly or indirectly.
Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, we indefinitely suspended all commercial activities in Russia.
Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we had no sales into Belarus or
23 Ukraine.
While the conflict continues to evolve and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not currently believe the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on our business and results of operations.
However, if the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater global economic or political disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted as a result. Our Outlook
We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2023, which provides us with access to capital through our cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility.
Our capital allocation strategy continues to guide our investing decisions, with a priority to direct capital to the highest risk-adjusted return opportunities, within the categories of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
With the strength of our financial position, we will continue to invest in financially and strategically attractive expanded product offerings, which are key elements of our long-term strategy of targeting long-term profitable growth.
We will continue to invest our capital in maintaining our facilities and in continuous improvement initiatives.
We recognize the importance of, and remain committed to, continuing to drive organic growth, as well as investing additional capital in opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns, driving increased penetration in the end markets we serve. We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, particularly as it relates to our assessment of valuation, prospective synergies, diligence, cultural fit and ease of integration, especially in light of uncertain and volatile global economic conditions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion provides an analysis of our condensed consolidated results of operations and results for each of our segments.
All acquisitions are described in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.
Falcon Stainless, Inc ("Falcon") activity has been included in our results within our Contractor Solutions segment since the October 4, 2022 acquisition date.
Cover Guard, Inc. (“CG”) and AC Guard, Inc. ("ACG") activities have been included in our results within our Contractor Solutions segment since the July 8, 2022 acquisition date.
Shoemaker Manufacturing, LLC ("Shoemaker") activity has been included in our results within our Contractor Solutions segment since the December 15, 2021 acquisition date.
Activity of Whitmore Manufacturing, LLC's joint venture with Shell (the "Whitmore JV") has been included in our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment since the April 1, 2021 formation date.
Consolidation of VIE (related to the Whitmore JV) is described in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.
Effective April 1, 2022, the commercial and operational activities of T.A. Industries, Inc. (“TRUaire”) were fully integrated with RectorSeal, the primary operating company of the Contractor Solutions segment.
Revenues, net
Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Revenues, net $ 171,093  $ 136,286  Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Revenues, net $ 562,219  $ 453,136  Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $34.8 million, or 25.5%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was partially due to the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon acquisitions ($12.0 million or 8.8%).
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, organic sales increased $22.8 million, or 16.7%, from the prior year primarily due to pricing initiatives.
Net revenue increased in the HVAC/R, general industrial, architecturally-specified building products, energy, mining and rail end markets. 24 Net revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $109.1 million, or 24.1%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was partially due to the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon ($31.6 million or 7.0%).
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, organic sales increased $77.5 million, or 17.1%, from the prior year due to pricing initiatives.
Net revenue increased in all the end markets served. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin
Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021* Gross profit $ 65,798  $ 51,343  Gross profit margin 38.5  % 37.7  % Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021* Gross profit $ 232,870  $ 183,620  Gross profit margin 41.4  % 40.5  % *Prior period has been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $14.5 million, or 28.2%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily a result of pricing initiatives and the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon.
Gross profit margin of 38.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 37.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was driven by net revenue growth in the Contractor Solutions segment outpacing other segments.
Gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $49.2 million, or 26.8%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily a result of pricing initiatives, the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon, along with the $3.9 million TRUaire purchase accounting effect and TRUaire Vietnam's COVID related expenses ($1.7 million) incurred in the prior year period that did not recur.
Gross profit margin of 41.4% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 40.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to the above-mentioned TRUaire-related expenses incurred in prior year period that did not recur.
Operating Expenses Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Operating expenses $ 42,686  $ 37,894  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, net 24.9  % 27.8  % Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Operating expenses $ 133,568  $ 115,177  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, net 23.8  % 25.4  % Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $4.8 million, or 12.6%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to added expenses related to the inclusion of Shoemaker in the current period, increased marketing expenses and third-party commissions to support the
revenue growth, as well as the increased amortizations of intangible assets as a result of recent acquisitions.
The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to revenue increasing by a greater percentage than the increase in operating expenses. 25 Operating expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $18.4 million, or 16.0%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to increased third-party sales commissions to support revenue growth, increased employee compensation expenses including equity compensation, increased professional fees primarily related to Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") optimization and recent acquisitions, along with the increased amortizations of intangible assets as a result of recent acquisitions.
Marketing and travel expenses increased in addition to added expenses related to the inclusion of Shoemaker in the current period.
The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to revenue increasing by a greater percentage than the increase in operating expenses. Operating Income Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021* Operating income $ 23,112  $ 13,449  Operating margin 13.5  % 9.9  % Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021* Operating income $ 99,302  $ 68,443  Operating margin 17.7  % 15.1  % *Prior period has been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $9.7 million, or 71.9%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses, as discussed above. Operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $30.9 million, or 45.1%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses, as discussed above. Other Income and Expense Net interest expense of $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $3.0 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Net interest expense of $9.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $4.9 million as compared to the
nine
months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was due to higher interest rates and increased borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility primarily in connection with the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon.
Other income (expense), net increased $0.6 million to net expense of $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared with net expense of $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the Canadian pension plan termination loss of $0.5 million in the current period.
Other income (expense), net increased $0.1 million to net expense of $0.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared with net expense of 0.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the Canadian pension plan termination loss mentioned above, partially offset by foreign currency exchange changes. 26 Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we earned $18.2 million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $2.7 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.7%.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we earned $89.7 million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $20.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.6%.
The provision for income taxes differed from the statutory rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a net decrease in the reserves for uncertain tax positions ("UTP"), excess tax deductions related to stock compensation, excess tax deductions related to Foreign-derived intangible income ("FDII") and the impact of US federal provision to return adjustment, partially offset by state income tax, net of federal benefit and executive compensation limitations.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, TRUaire's Vietnam entity concluded its audit for the tax periods from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2022 and received an audit closing letter from the tax authority.
As a result, $1.5 million of the UTP accrual (including penalties and interests accrued post-acquisition) was released and recorded as an income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we earned $12.1 million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $2.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.7%.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we earned $63.9 million from operations before taxes and provided for income taxes of $15.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.6%.
The provision for income taxes differed from the statutory rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to excess tax deductions related to stock compensation, the impact of federal return to provision adjustments and deductions related to FDII, partially offset by state and foreign income taxes, executive compensation limitations, an increase in the reserve for UTP and foreign tax credits. One of our Canadian subsidiaries is currently under audit by the taxing authority for tax periods from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2020. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on how we manage the business.
We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment's operating income.
The key operating results for our three segments are discussed below.
Contractor Solutions Segment Results The Contractor Solutions segment manufactures efficiency and performance enhancing products predominantly for residential and commercial HVAC/R and plumbing applications, which are designed primarily for professional end-use customers. Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021* Revenues, net $ 111,907  $ 82,459  Operating income 21,829  11,324    Operating margin 19.5  % 13.7  % Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021* Revenues, net $ 379,831  $ 296,048  Operating income 90,416  67,589    Operating margin 23.8  % 22.8  % *Prior period has been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 27 Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $29.4 million, or 35.7%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was partially due to the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon ($12.0 million or 14.6%).
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, organic sales increased by $17.4 million, or 21.1%, due to pricing initiatives, partially offset by a slight decrease in unit volumes.
Net revenue increased in the HVAC/R and architecturally-specified building product end markets Net revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $83.8 million, or 28.3%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was partially due to the acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon ($31.6 million or 10.7%).
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, organic sales increased by $52.2 million, or 17.6%, due to pricing initiatives, partially offset by a slight decrease in unit volumes. Net revenue increased in the HVAC/R and architecturally-specified building product end markets and decreased in the general industrial end market. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $10.5 million, or 92.8%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was due to the increased net revenue and the inclusion of recent acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon, as well as the transaction expense ($0.5 million) related to the Shoemaker acquisition and TRUaire Vietnam's COVID related expenses ($0.5 million) incurred in the prior year period that did not recur.
Operating margin of 19.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 13.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was due to gross margin improvement driven primarily by pricing initiatives and a reduction in cost of shipping containers, as well as reduced growth in operating expense as a percentage of revenue. Operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $22.8 million, or 33.8%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was due to the increased net revenue and the inclusion of recent acquisitions of Shoemaker, CG, ACG and Falcon as well as the $3.9 million TRUaire purchase accounting effect and TRUaire Vietnam's COVID related expenses ($1.7 million) incurred in the prior year period that did not recur.
Operating margin of 23.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 22.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to the above-mentioned TRUaire-related expenses incurred in the prior year period that did not recur. Engineered Building Solutions Segment Results
The Engineered Building Solutions
segment provides primarily code-driven, life-safety products that are engineered to provide aesthetically-pleasing solutions for the construction, refurbishment and modernization of commercial, institutional and multi-family residential buildings.

` Net revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $5.6 million or 7.6% as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 due to successful commercial initiatives and new product introductions. 28 Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $0.9 million, or 29.5%, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease was due to a shift in sales to lower margin projects.
Operating margin of 9.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased as compared to 13.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
This decrease was primarily due to a shift in sales to lower margin projects. Operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased $0.8 million, or 8.4%, as compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was due to the increased net revenue and management of operating expenses.
Operating margin of 12.9% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 12.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
This slight increase was primarily due to effective management of operating expenses, mostly offset by the shift in sales to lower margin projects. Specialized Reliability Solutions Segment Results

Operating margin of 12.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to 6.2% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to gross margin improvement as a result of leverage from revenue volume increase, pricing initiatives, as well as reduced growth in operating expense as a percentage of revenue. 29 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
General Existing cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity.
Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock.
Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable.
Additionally, we use our Revolving Credit Facility to support our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions.
We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt.
Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities, primarily our Revolving Credit Facility, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs. Cash Flow Analysis   Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021* Net cash provided by operating activities
$ 84,072  $ 69,472  Net cash used in investing activities (63,722) (44,762) Net cash used in financing activities (21,619) (18,569) *Prior period has been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our cash balance (including cash and cash equivalents) at December 31, 2022 was $14.7 million, as compared with $16.6 million at March 31, 2022. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our cash provided by operating activities from operations was $84.1 million, as compared with $69.5 million for nine months ended December 31, 2021.
• Working capital used cash for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 due to higher inventories ($28.3 million), higher prepaid expenses and other current assets ($8.3 million) and lower accounts payable and other current liabilities ($7.3 million), partially offset by lower accounts receivable ($22.0 million). • Working capital used cash for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher inventories ($33.3 million)
and higher prepaid and other current assets ($4.8 million), partially offset by
higher accounts payable and other current liabilities ($12.0 million) and lower accounts receivable ($5.6 million). Cash flows used in investing activities from operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $63.7 million, as compared with $44.8 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
• Capital expenditures during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $8.3 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures have been focused on capacity expansion (including $3.6 million and $2.7 million during the current and prior year periods for the Whitmore JV), enterprise resource planning systems, new product introductions, continuous improvement and automation of manufacturing facilities. • During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the full contingent payment of $2.0 million was remitted to the Shoemaker sellers due to the performance obligation being met as part of the Shoemaker acquisition,
a s discussed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. • During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we acquired the assets of CG and ACG and related intellectual property for $19.7 million in cash considerations, as discussed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.
• During the
nine months ended December 31, 2022, we acquired Falcon for an aggregate purchase price of $37.1 million, including $34.6 million in cash consideration at closing, as discussed in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements in this Quarterly Report • During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we received proceeds of $1.4 million as a result of a final working capital true-up adjustment related to the TRUaire acquisition. 30 • During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we acquired Shoemaker for an aggregate purchase price of $43.6 million, including $38.6 in cash consideration, as discussed in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements in this Quarterly Report Cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $21.6 million and $18.6 million, respectively.
Cash outflows resulted from: • Net borrowing (repayments) on our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan (as discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report) of $23.8 million and $(11.4) million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. • Payments of $2.3 million of underwriting fees in connection with our Second Credit Agreement during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, as discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. • Payments of $0.7 million of underwriting fees in connection with our Second Amendment to the the Second Credit Agreement during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. • Repurchases of shares under our share repurchase program (as discussed in Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report) of $35.7 million and $0.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
• Proceeds from the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholder for its investment in the consolidated Whitmore JV of $2.0 million and $6.3 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as discussed in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. • Dividend payments of $7.9 million and $7.1 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Acquisitions and Dispositions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes.  The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation.
Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report contains a discussion of the recent acquisitions. Financing Credit Facilities See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of our indebtedness.  We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to variable interest payments related to our indebtedness.  On January 2023, the interest rate swap was terminated.
This agreement is more fully described in Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, and in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” below.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained within this Quarterly Report. Our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements were discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report.
No significant changes to these policies, as described in our Annual Report, have occurred in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The process of preparing condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  These estimates and assumptions are based upon what we believe is the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions.  The
31 estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change.  Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  This is not to suggest that other general risk factors, such as changes in worldwide demand, changes in material costs, performance of acquired businesses and others, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.
See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements appearing in this Quarterly Report constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include expected restructuring charges and the results of the restructuring, financial projections, statements of plans and objectives for future operations, statements of future economic performance, and statements of assumptions relating thereto. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” “potential,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements that relate to, or statements that are subject to risks, contingencies or uncertainties that relate to:   • our business strategy; • changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; • potential disruptions from wars and military conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine; • future levels of revenues, operating margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; • the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressure, including reductions on consumer discretionary income and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices; • anticipated levels of demand for our products and services; • the actual impact to supply, production levels and costs from global supply chain logistics and transportation challenges; • short and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; • our outstanding indebtedness, including the effect of rising interest rates; • future levels of research and development, capital, environmental or maintenance expenditures; • our beliefs regarding the timing and effects on our business of health and safety, tax, environmental or other legislation, rules and regulations; • the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, restructuring or maintenance projects; • expectations regarding the acquisition or divestiture of assets and businesses; • our ability to obtain appropriate insurance and indemnities; • the potential effects of judicial or other proceedings, including tax audits, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities, or plaintiffs in litigation; • the expected impact of accounting pronouncements; and • other factors listed under "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report and other filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements for a number of important factors, including those listed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report.
You should not put undue reliance on any forwarding-looking statements in this Quarterly Report.
We assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 32 Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  We seek to minimize the risk associated with changes in interest rates through regular operating and financing activities, and when deemed appropriate, through the use of an interest rate swap.  It is our policy to enter into interest rate swaps only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives.  We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Variable Rate Indebtedness We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct effect on interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2022, we had $267.2 million in outstanding variable rate indebtedness, after consideration of our interest rate swap.  We manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of an interest rate swap agreement.  At December 31, 2022, we had an interest rate swap agreement that covered 3.4% of our $276.5 million total outstanding indebtedness.
As discussed in Note 9, the interest rate swap was terminated on January 9, 2023.
Starting in January 2023, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $0.7 million change in our interest expense on an annual basis.
We may also be exposed to credit risk in derivative contracts we may use.  Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.  If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us.  If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk.  We have sought to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We conduct a small portion of our operations outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our non-U.S. operations are conducted primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies, and include the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar and Vietnamese dong.  Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than a non-U.S. operation’s functional currency.
We recognized foreign currency transaction net gain (loss) of $0.5 million and less than $(0.1) million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are included in other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income.
We realized a net gain (loss) associated with foreign currency translation of $(4.1) million and $(0.1) million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Based on a sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2022, a 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 would have impacted our net earnings by a negligible amount.  This calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar and that there are no indirect effects, such as changes in non-U.S. dollar sales volumes or prices. Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 33 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
Legal Proceedings. The disclosure contained in Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report is incorporated by reference into this “Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”
In addition to the foregoing, we and our subsidiaries are from time to time named defendants in certain lawsuits incidental to our business, including product liability claims that are insured, subject to applicable deductibles, and are involved from time to time as parties to governmental proceedings, all arising in the ordinary course of business.
Although the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings involving us and our subsidiaries cannot be predicted with certainty, and the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to such lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted accurately, management does not currently expect the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A.
Risk Factors. There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control.
In addition to other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, careful consideration should be given to “Item 1A.
Risk Factors” in Part I and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of our Annual Report, which contain descriptions of significant factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. There have been no material changes in the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report and subsequent SEC filings. The risks described in this Quarterly Report, our Annual Report and in our other SEC filings or press releases from time to time are not the only risks we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties are currently deemed immaterial based on management’s assessment of currently available information, which remains subject to change; however, new risks that are currently unknown to us may arise in the future that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Item 2.
