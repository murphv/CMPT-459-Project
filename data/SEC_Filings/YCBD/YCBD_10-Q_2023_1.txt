NOTE

–
ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
cbdMD, Inc. (“cbdMD”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or the “Company”) is a North Carolina corporation formed on
March 17, 2015
as Level Beauty Group, Inc. In
November 2016
we changed the name of the Company to Level Brands, Inc. and on
May 1, 2019
we changed the name of our Company to cbdMD, Inc. We operate from our offices located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our fiscal year end is established as
September 30.
On
December 20, 2018 ( the “Closing Date”), the Company, and its newly organized wholly owned subsidiaries AcqCo, LLC and cbdMD LLC (“CBDI”), completed a
two -step merger (the “Mergers”) with Cure Based Development, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Cure Based Development”). Upon completion of the Mergers, CBDI survived and operates the prior business of Cure Based Development. As consideration for the Mergers in
April
of
2019,
the Company issued
15,250,000
shares of our common stock to the members of Cure Based Development, of which unrestricted voting rights to
8,750,000
of the shares vest over a
five -year period of which
2,187,500
shares remain subject to a voting proxy agreement as of
December
31,2022,
as well as to issue another
15,250,000
shares of our common stock (the “Earnout Shares”) in the future upon certain earnout goals (the “Earnout Rights”) being achieved within
five
years from the closing of the Mergers.
The Company owns and operates the nationally recognized CBD (cannabidiol) brands cbdMD, Paw CBD and cbdMD Botanicals. The Company sources cannabinoids, including CBD, which are extracted from non-GMO hemp grown on farms in the United States. CBD is a natural substance produced from the hemp plant. The products manufactured by and for the Company comply with the
2018
Farm Bill - our full spectrum products contain trace amounts of THC under the
0.3%
by dry weight limit in the
2018
Farm Act while our broad spectrum products are non-psychoactive as they do
not
contain detectable levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
In the
third
quarter of fiscal
2019
cbdMD launched its new CBD pet brand, Paw CBD. Following the initial positive response to the brand from retailers and consumers, cbdMD, Inc. organized Paw CBD, Inc. (“Paw CBD”) as a separate wholly owned subsidiary on
October 22, 2019,
to take advantage of its early mover status in the CBD animal health industry. On
March 15, 2021
cbdMD formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, cbdMD Therapeutics, LLC (“Therapeutics”) for the purposes of isolating and quantifying the Company’s ongoing investments in science related to its existing and future products, including research and development activities for therapeutic applications.  In
July 2021,
the Company acquired the assets of Twenty Two Capital, LLC (“Twenty Two”) d/b/a directcbdonline.com (“DCO”). This business operates a CBD marketplace through directcbdonline.com.
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of cbdMD have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the
2022
10 -K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal
2022
as reported in the
2022
10 -K have been omitted.
Principles of Consolidation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries CBDI, Paw CBD and Therapeutics. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant estimates made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are
not
limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, expected sales returns and allowances, certain assumptions related to the valuation of investments other securities, acquired intangibles and long-lived assets and the recoverability of intangible and long-lived assets and income taxes, including deferred tax valuation allowances and reserves for estimated tax liabilities, contingent liability and, hence consideration for the Mergers is a material estimate. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
While the Company has been relatively successful in navigating the impact of COVID- 19,
it had previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, changes in product distribution and employment and compensation adjustments. There are also ongoing related risks to the Company’s business depending on any resurgence of the pandemic. The Company continues to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve its business as appropriate.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For financial statements purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than
three
months when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts, if applicable. Credit is extended to customers after an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition, and generally collateral is
not
required as a condition of credit extension. Management’s determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an evaluation of the receivables, past experience, current economic conditions, and other risks inherent in the receivables portfolio. As of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022 , we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 2,047
and $ 36,980 , respectively.
Merchant Receivable and Reserve
The Company primarily sells its products through the internet and has an arrangement to process customer payments with
third -party payment processors and negotiate the fee based on the market. The arrangement with the payment processors requires that the Company pay a fee between
2.6 % and
5.0 % of the transaction amounts processed. Pursuant to this agreement, there can be a waiting period between
2
to
5
days prior to reimbursement to the Company, as well as a calculated reserve which some payment processors hold back. Fees and reserves can change periodically with notice from the processors. At
December 31, 2022  and
September 30, 2022,
the receivable from payment processors included approximately $ 265,477
and $ 273,451 , respectively, for the waiting period amount and is recorded as accounts receivable in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a weighted average basis. The cost of inventory includes product cost, freight-in, and production fill and labor (portions of which we outsource to
third
party manufacturers). Write-offs of potentially slow moving or damaged inventory are recorded based on management’s analysis of inventory levels, forecasted future sales volume and pricing and through specific identification of obsolete or damaged products. We assess inventory quarterly for slow moving products and potential impairments and at a minimum perform a physical inventory count annually near fiscal year end.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment items are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Generally, the useful lives are
five
years for manufacturing equipment and automobiles and
three
years for software, computer, and furniture and equipment. The useful life for leasehold improvements are over the term of the lease, or the remaining economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property are eliminated from the accounts upon disposal, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations for the applicable period. Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset
may
not
be recoverable.
Fair Value Accounting
The Company utilizes accounting standards for fair value, which include the definition of fair value, the framework for measuring fair value, and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is a market-based measurement,
not
an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels
1
and
2
of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level
3
of the hierarchy).
Level
1
inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level
2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level
1
that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level
2
inputs
may
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability. Level
3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, observable market activity. In instances where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
When the Company records an investment in marketable securities the carrying value is assigned at fair value. Any changes in fair value for marketable securities during a given period will be recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. For investment other securities without a readily determinable fair value, the Company
may
elect to estimate its fair value at cost less impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.

Table of Contents
Intangible Assets
The Company’s intangible assets consist of  definite-lived trademarks and other intellectual property. Prior to
December 31, 2021,
the Company employed the non-amortization approach to account for purchased intangible assets having indefinite lives. Under the non-amortization approach, intangible assets having indefinite lives are
not
amortized into the results of operations, but instead are reviewed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, to assess whether their fair value exceeds their carrying value. The Company now accounts for its trademarks in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
360,
Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company began amortizing its trademarks over
20
years beginning
January 1, 2022
and will perform impairment tests as prescribed by ASC
360,
which states that impairment testing should be completed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying value
may
not
be recoverable. If there are indications that the asset’s carrying value
may
not
be recoverable, there are
two
further steps involved in long-lived asset impairment testing. Step I of the impairment test, as per ASC
360,
involves estimating the Recoverable Amount of the Asset Group and determining the potential for impairment. Step II of the impairment test, as per ASC
360,
if necessary, involves quantifying the fair value of the asset group.
Contingent Liability
A significant component of the purchase price consideration for the Company’s acquisition of Cure Based Development includes a fixed number of future shares to be issued as well as a variable number of future shares to be issued based upon the post-acquisition entity reaching certain specified future revenue targets, as further described in Note
6.
The Company made a determination of the fair value of the contingent liabilities as part of the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination.
Revenue Recognition
Under ASC
606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
the Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the
five -step model prescribed under ASC
606:
(i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.
14
Table of Contents
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. The Company meets that obligation when it has shipped products which have been ordered to the customer. The Company has reviewed its various revenue streams for its other contracts under the
five -step approach. At
December 31, 2022 , the Company has
no
unfulfilled performance obligations.
Allocation of Transaction Price
In the Company’s current business model, it does
not
have contracts with customers which have multiple elements as revenue is driven purely by online product sales or purchase order-based product sales.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue from the sale of its products when its customer obtains control, which is upon shipping (and is typically FOB shipping) which is when our performance obligation is met. Net sales are comprised of gross revenues less product returns, trade discounts and customer allowances, which include costs associated with off-invoice mark-downs and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions. These incentive costs are recognized at the later of the date on which the Company recognizes the related revenue or the date on which the Company offers the incentive. The Company currently offers a
60 -day, money back guarantee, a loyalty program as well as a subscription program.
Disaggregated Revenue
The Company’s product revenue is generated primarily through
two
sales channels, E-commerce sales (formerly referred to as consumer sales) and wholesale sales. The Company believes that these categories appropriately reflect how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are impacted by economic factors.
A description of the Company’s principal revenue generating activities are as follows:
-
E-commerce sales - consumer products sold through the Company’s online and telephonic channels. Revenue is recognized when control of the merchandise is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment is typically due prior to the date of shipment; and
-
Wholesale sales - products sold to the Company’s wholesale customers for subsequent resale. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Payment terms vary and can typically be
30
days from the date control over the product is transferred to the customer.
Contract liabilities represent unearned revenues and are presented as deferred revenue or customer deposits on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Other than account receivable, Company has
no
material contract assets nor contract liabilities at
December 31, 2022 .

Cost of Sales
The Company’s cost of sales includes costs associated with distribution, fill and labor expense, components,
third -party providers, and outbound freight for the Company’s products sales, and includes labor for its service sales. For the Company’s product sales, cost of sales also includes the cost of refurbishing products returned by customers that will be offered for resale, if any, and the cost of inventory write-downs associated with adjustments of held inventories to their net realizable value. These expenses are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations when the product is sold and net sales revenues are recognized or, in the case of inventory write-downs, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of inventories is in excess of their net realizable value.
Income Taxes
The Company is a North Carolina corporation that is treated as a corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. As of
October 1, 2019,
CBDI and Paw CBD were wholly owned subsidiaries and are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their entire share of taxable income or loss is included in the tax return of the Company and as of
March 15, 2021,
Therapeutics is also a wholly owned subsidiary and is a disregarded entity for tax purposes and its entire share of taxable income or loss is included in the tax return of the Company.
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of the
Accounting for Income Taxes
topic of ASC
740
which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company uses the inside basis approach to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with its investment in a consolidated pass-through entity. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than
not
that the net deferred asset will
not
be realized.
Concentrations
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and securities.
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the United States. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) covers $ 250,000
for substantially all depository accounts. The Company from time to time
may
have amounts on deposit in excess of the insured limits. The Company had a $ 2.7
million uninsured balance at
December 31, 2022
and a $ 5.8
million uninsured balance at
September 30, 2022 .
Concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is principally limited to trade receivables with corporate customers that meet specific credit policies. Management considers these customer receivables to represent normal business risk. The Company did
not
have any customers that represented a significant amount of our sales for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022 .
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock compensation under the ASC
718 - 10 - 30,
Compensation - Stock Compensation
using the fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that
may
be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options and warrants. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. The Company recognizes forfeitures when they occur.

Table of Contents
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company uses ASC
260 - 10,
Earnings Per Share for calculating the basic and diluted income (loss) per share. The Company computes basic income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, after deducting preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of net loss per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company experienced a loss of $ 3,956,062
for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022,
resulting in working capital of $ 5,977,801 .
While the Company is taking strong action, believes in the viability of its strategy and path to profitability, and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be
no
assurances to that effect.  The Company’s working capital position
may
not
be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations for the
twelve
months subsequent to the issuance of these quarterly financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire additional funding. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within
twelve
months after the date that the quarterly financial statements are issued. These financial statements do
not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may
result in the Company
not
being able to continue as a going concern.
New Accounting Standards
None.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT OTHER SECURITIES
The Company has, from time to time, entered into contracts where a portion of the consideration provided by the customer in exchange for the Company’s services was common stock, options or warrants (an equity position). In these situations, upon invoicing the customer for the stock or other instruments, the Company recorded the receivable as accounts receivable other, and used the value of the stock or other instrument upon invoicing to determine the value. If there is insufficient data to support the valuation of the security directly, the Company will value it, and the underlying revenue, on the estimated fair value of the services provided. In determining fair value of marketable securities and investment other securities, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. The Company determines the fair value of marketable securities and investment other securities based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in
one
of the following levels:
●
Level
1
Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
●
Level
2
Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level
1
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
●
Level
3
Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are
not
available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Where an accounts receivable other is settled with the receipt of the common stock or other instrument, the common stock or other instrument was classified as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet as either an investment marketable security (when the customer is a public entity) or as an investment other security (when the customer is a privately held entity).
For the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021
the Company recorded $ 0  and $( 33,350 ) respectively, of realized and unrealized gain (loss) on marketable and other securities, including impairments. The realized loss in the  first
quarter of fiscal
2021
was a result of marking the Company’s holdings of
1,042,193
shares of Isodiol International, Inc. (“Isodiol”) down to
zero
after Isodiol was delisted from the TSX during
December 2021.
In
September 2020,
the Company purchased a membership interest in Adara Sponsor LLC for $ 250,000 , which along with proceeds from other investors was utilized as an investment in Adara Acquisition Corporation (“Adara”), a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (a “SPAC”). On
January 13, 2021,
the Company executed
second
tranche subscriptions agreements and funded the remaining $ 750,000
commitment into Adara Sponsor, LLC. Certain affiliates of the Company have also invested in Adara Sponsor, LLC. On
February 9, 2021,
the public shares of Adara began trading on the NYSE. Commencing
March 24, 2021,
holders of the
11,500,000
units sold in the Adara’s initial public offering could elect to separately trade shares of the Adara Class A common stock and warrants included in the units. The shares of Class A common stock and warrants that were separated now trade on NYSE American LLC under the symbols “ADRA” and “ADRA WS”, respectively. On
December 31, 2022 , the Company’s implied, indirect ownership in Adara represented
4.4 % ( 633,988
shares) and
10.1 % ( 1
million) of the warrants. As of
December 31, 2022 , ADRA stock closed at $ 10.18
while ADRA WS closed at $ 0.07 .  On
June 22, 2022,
the Company executed a transfer agreement with affiliates of Adara Sponsor, LLC whereby the Company's interest would be transferred to the affiliates of Adara Sponsor, LLC upon Adara's acquisition of Allliance Entertainment, Inc. (the "Target") in consideration of the Company's original purchase price. As a result of the SEC litigation against our former CEO, the Target provided a demand to Adara that it required cbdMD and Mr. Sumichrast to dispose of our interests in Adara Sponsor, LLC as a condition of proceeding with any business combination. On
June 23, 2022,
Adara announced it had entered into business combination agreements with the Target subject to a number of conditions to closing, including shareholder SEC approval. In
December 2022,
Adara filed its definitive proxy to approve the acquisition and query shareholders redemption.  There are
no
assurances the business combination will be completed. If the business combination is
not
completed, Adara faces a potential redemption from its shareholders during
February 2023.
Should this business combination
not
be effectuated, the Company risks losing it's $ 1
million investment in Adara Sponsor LLC.
Adara’s focus of targets to pursue for the business combination are expected to be in the consumer products industry including business in the health and wellness, e-commerce, discretionary spending, information technology sectors and related channels of distribution.
On
April 7, 2022,
CBD Industries, LLC entered into an asset sale agreement to sell substantially all its manufacturing assets to a subsidiary of Steady State, LLC ("Steady State"). The equipment sale is initially valued at approximately $ 1.8
million for accounting purposes, the sale price consisting of products to be provided to the Company under the manufacturing and supply agreement and $ 1.4
million of which the Company invested into Steady State in the form of an equity investment consistent with the terms of Steady State's recently completed series C financing. The Company has classified this investment as Level
3
for fair value measurement purposes as there are
no
observable inputs and has included in non-current assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as the company intends to hold this investment for longer than a year.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
The Company had goodwill at
December 31, 2021
was $ 42,772,685 . The Company impaired goodwill in subsequent reporting periods of fiscal
2022  and goodwill was fully impaired by
September 30, 2022.
Intangible Assets
On
December 20, 2018,
the Company completed the Mergers with Cure Based Development and acquired certain assets, including the trademark “cbdMD” and its variants and certain other intellectual property. The trademark is the cornerstone of this subsidiary and is key as the Company creates and distributes products and continue to build this brand. The Company believed the trademark did
not
have limits on the time it would contribute to the generation of cash flows and therefore identified these as indefinite lived intangible assets.
In
July 2021,
the Company completed the acquisition of DCO and acquired certain assets, including the trade name, domains and certain other intellectual property. The tradename will be used in marketing and branding of the website. The Company believes the trade name has a
10
year life. In addition to the trade name, DCO has a technology platform used to market to its customer and the Company believes it has a
4
year life.
As of
December 31, 2021,
the Company re-assessed the “cbdMD” and “HempMD” trademarks and determined that the trademarks should be classified as definite lived intangible assets with useful lives of
20
years versus indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company used a variety of factors in determining the reclassifications and have made the reclassifications following guidance prescribed by ASC
350,
which states that when a reporting entity subsequently determines that in indefinite-lived intangible asset has a finite useful life, the reporting entity should test the asset for impairment as an indefinite lived asset prior to commencing amortization. As of
December 31, 2021,
the Company prepared a tradename impairment analysis in accordance with ASC
350
and determined that the “cbdMD” trademark was impaired by $ 4,285,000 . The Company has recorded this impairment charge as a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets with the corresponding impairment expense recorded on its condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company began amortizing the trademarks over their useful lives of
20
years as of
January 2022.
Intangible assets as of

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
As consideration for the Mergers, described in Note
1,
the Company had a contractual obligation to issue
15,250,000
shares of its common stock, after approval by its shareholders, to the members of Cure Based Development, issued in
two
tranches
6,500,000
shares and
8,750,000
shares, both of which are subject to leak out provisions, and the unrestricted voting rights to
8,750,000
tranche of shares will also vest over a
five
year period and are subject to a voting proxy agreement. The Merger Agreement also provides that an additional
15,250,000
Earnout Shares can be issued upon the satisfaction of certain aggregate net revenue criteria by cbdMD within
60
months following the Closing Date.
The contractual obligations and earn out provision are accounted for as a contingent liability and fair value is determined using Level
3
inputs, as estimating the fair value of these contingent liabilities require the use of significant and subjective inputs that
may
and are likely to change over the duration of the liabilities with related changes in internal and external market factors.
The initial
two
tranches totaling
15,250,000
shares were valued using a market approach method and included the use of the following inputs: share price upon contractual obligation, discount for lack of marketability to address leak out restrictions, and probability of shareholder disapproval. In addition, the
8,750,000
shares in the
second
tranche also included an input for a discount for lack of voting rights during the vest periods.
The Merger Agreement also provides that an additional
15,250,000
Earnout Shares would be issued as part of the consideration for the Mergers, upon the satisfaction of certain aggregate net revenue criteria by cbdMD within
60
months following the Closing Date as follows, as measured at
four
intervals (each a “marking period”): the completion of
12,
24,
42,
and
59
calendar months from the Closing Date, and based upon the ratios set forth below:
Aggregate Net Revenues
Shares Issued/ Each $ of Aggregate Net Revenue Ratio
$ 1
- $ 20,000,000
.190625
$ 20,000,001
- $ 60,000,000
.0953125
$ 60,000,001
- $ 140,000,000
.04765625
$ 140,000,001
- $ 300,000,000
.023828125
For clarification purposes, the Aggregate Net Revenues during a Marking Period shall be multiplied by the applicable Shares Issued/Each $ of Aggregate Net Revenue Ratio, minus, the number of shares issued as a result of Aggregate Net Revenues during the prior marking periods.
The
third
marking period was originally an
18
month period commencing on
January 1, 2021
and ending on
June 30, 2022 ( the “Third Marking Period End Date”), after which time the determination of the issuance of any remaining Earnout Shares would be made pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. On
March 31, 2021
the Company entered into Addendum
No.
1
to the Merger Agreement (“Addendum
No.
1” ) with the holders of the remaining Earnout Rights which amended the measurement periods within the
third
marking period to change the determination of the aggregate net revenues within the
third
marking period to a quarterly basis for each of the
six
fiscal quarters within the
third
marking period, beginning with the quarter ended
March 31, 2021,
instead of following Third Marking Period End Date. This change in the measurement date, however, has
no
effect on the number of remaining Earnout Shares issuable under the Earnout Rights and
no
effect on the earnout targets; Addendum
No.
1
simply changes the physical issuance date(s) of the remaining Earnout Shares, if in fact, such shares are earned pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Addendum
No.
1
did
not
change any of the terms of the
fourth
marking period (as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement). This change did
not
impact the fair value of the contingent liability. The value of the contingent liability was
$ 215,000  and $ 276,000
at
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022  respectively.
The
fourth
marketing period began on
July 1, 2022
and ends in
November 2023.
At
December 31, 2022,
up to
3,928,797
remaining Earnout Shares are subject to issuance by the Company.  Based on the remaining share ratios, the Company would have to generate over $ 162
million in revenue during the
fourth
marking period to issue the full balance of the shares.

As part of the Twenty Two acquisition in
July 2021,
the Company has a contractual obligation to issue up to an additional
200,000
shares of its common stock as additional consideration, dependent upon the acquisition entity meeting future revenue targets. Under US GAAP the Company is required to record a non-cash contingent liability associated with the Twenty Two Earnout Shares and at the date of the acquisition, recorded a total contingent liability of $ 488,561 . Under US GAAP the Company is obligated to reassess the obligations associated with the Twenty Two Earnout Shares on a quarterly basis and, in the event its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, the Company will record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings. In particular, changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock, which is
one
of the inputs used in determining the amount of the non-cash contingent liability, will result in increases or decreases in this liability and positively or negatively impact the Company’s net loss or profit for the period. At
September 30, 2022 , the Company recorded a decrease in value of the contingent liability of
$ 73,561
rel ated to a decrease in the market price of our common stock, which adjusted the total contingent liability related to the Twenty Two Earnout Shares to $ 416,000 . At
December 31, 2021,
the Company recorded a decrease in value of the contingent liability of $ 255,000
related to a decrease in the market price of our common stock, which adjusted the total contingent liability related to the Twenty Two Earnout Shares to $ 161,000 .  At
June 30, 2022,
the Company recorded a decrease in value of the contingent liability of $ 13,000
related to a decrease in the market price of our common stock, which adjusted the total contingent liability related to the Twenty Two Earnout Shares to $ 0 . As of
September 2022
the measurement period ended and there is
no
further obligation with respect to this earnout.
In
April 2022,
the Company entered into a contractual obligation to issue up to
100,000
options to an employee.  The shares are subject to meeting a minimum direct to consumer revenue of $ 12.0
million for the
December 2022
calendar quarter. This requirement was
not
satisfied and
no
further obligation exists as of
December 31, 2022.
In
December 2022,
the Company entered into a contractual obligation to issue up to
25,000
options and
25,000
RSUs to an employee.  The shares are subject to meeting a minimum direct to consumer revenue of $ 45
million for any
four
consecutive quarters before
December 31, 2024.
Based on the present revenue run rate, the Company has valued these obligations at $ 0
for
December 31, 2022.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Equity Compensation Plan – On
June 2, 2015,
the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
2015
Equity Compensation Plan ( “2015
Plan”). The
2015
Plan initially made
1,175,000
common stock shares, either unissued or reacquired by the Company, available for awards of options, restricted stocks, other stock grants, or any combination thereof. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the
2015
Plan shall automatically increase on the
first
trading day of
October
each calendar year during the term of the
2015
Plan, beginning with calendar year
2016,
by an amount equal to
one
percent ( 1 %) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading day in
September
of the immediately preceding fiscal year, but in
no
event shall any such annual increase exceed
100,000
shares of common stock. On
April 19, 2019,
shareholders approved an amendment to the
2015
Plan and increased the number of shares available for issuance under the
2015
Plan to
2,000,000
and retained the annual evergreen increase provision of the plan.
On
January 8, 2021,
the Company’s Board of Directors approved the
2021
Equity Compensation Plan (the
“2021
Plan”) and it was subsequently approved by its shareholders at its annual meeting held on
March 12, 2021.
The purpose of the
2021
Plan is to advance the interests of the Company by providing an incentive to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and competent persons who are important to it and upon whose efforts and judgment the success of the Company is largely dependent. The
2021
Plan made
5,000,000
common shares, either unissued or reacquired by the Company, available for awards of options, restricted stocks, other stock grants, or any combination thereof. The
2021
Plan also contains an “evergreen formula” pursuant to which the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the
2021
Plan will automatically increase on
October 1
of each calendar year during the term of the
2021
Plan, beginning with calendar year
2022,
by an amount equal to
1.0 % of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on
September 30
of such calendar year, up to a maximum of
250,000
shares.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the provisions of ASC
718.
ASC
718
codification requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock-based compensation expense in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the options. All options are approved by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors. Restricted stock awards that vest in accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. The fair value of the Company’s stock option awards or modifications is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Eligible recipients include employees, officers, directors and consultants who are deemed to have rendered or to be able to render significant services to the Company or its subsidiaries and who are deemed to have contributed or to have the potential to contribute to the success of the Company. Options granted generally have a
five -to- ten -year term and have vesting terms that cover
one
to
three
years from the date of grant. Certain of the stock options granted under the plan have been granted pursuant to various stock option agreements. Each stock option agreement contains specific terms.
Stock Options :
The Company currently has awards outstanding with service conditions and graded-vesting features. We recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

LEASES
The Company has lease agreements for its corporate offices and warehouse with lease periods expiring between
2024  and
2026.
ASC
842
requires the recognition of leasing arrangements on the consolidated balance sheet as right-of-use assets and liabilities pertaining to the rights and obligations created by the leased assets. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception and classify it as finance or operating. All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company’s leases do
not
contain any residual value guarantees. During the
June 2022
quarter, the Company exited its laboratory facility as all R&D is conducted in its corporate offices. This lease expired in
December 2022,
and as a result we incurred an exit fee of $ 80,000
tied to the landlord's right to holdover rent which was booked as an offset to gain on the sold assets for the quarter ending
June 30, 2022.
Right-of-use lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. Since the interest rate implicit in our lease arrangements is
not
readily determinable, the Company determined an incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the approximate interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar remaining terms and payments as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company’s lease terms
may
include options to extend or terminate the lease.
In addition to the monthly base amounts in the lease agreements, the Company is required to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance expenses during the lease terms.
Lease costs on operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

On
November 17, 2017,
the Company completed an IPO of its common stock. The Company conducted a Section

analysis and determined an ownership change occurred upon the IPO. On
October 2, 2018,
the Company completed a follow-on firm commitment underwritten public offering of its common stock. On

the Company completed a follow-on firm commitment underwritten public offering of its
8.0 % Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. On
January 14, 2020,
the Company completed a follow-on firm commitment underwritten public offering of its common stock. Management has determined that an ownership change has occurred under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section
382
resulting in limitations on the utilization of Company’s federal and state NOL carryovers.
On
December 20, 2018,
the Company completed a
two -step merger with Cure Based Development (see Note
1 ). As a result of the Mergers the Company established as part of the purchase price allocation a net deferred tax liability related to the book-tax basis of certain assets and liabilities of approximately $ 4.6
million.
The Company has a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets, with the exception of the deferred tax liabilities that result from indefinite-life intangibles (“naked credits”). The Company has determined that using the general methodology for calculating income taxes during an interim period for the quarters ending
December 31, 2019,
March 31, 2020,
and
June 30, 2020,
provided for a wide range of potential annual effective rates. Therefore, the Company had calculated the tax provision on a discrete basis under ASC
740 - 270 - 30 -
36 (b) for the quarters ending
December 31, 2019,
March 31, 2020,
and
June 30, 2020.
At
September 30, 2022
the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of
zero
as the cumulative net deferred tax asset had a full valuation on it and there was
not
enough positive evidence that would warrant recognizing the benefit of the net deferred tax asset. In addition, the net indefinite lived deferred tax items were a deferred tax asset so there was
not
any recognition of a deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities. At
December 31, 2022 , the Company determined the same circumstances to be true and therefore recorded a net deferred tax asset of zero.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT ’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of several factors, including those set forth under the Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Business sections in our 2022 10-K, this report, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this report.

In addition, we operate a CBD marketplace through directcbdonline.com, our own e-commerce website.
Recent Developments
At the end of September 2022, we shifted our USA product offering to focus on higher CBD concentration levels for better consumer efficacy while eliminating a number of lower strength SKUs. These products are supported by clinical claims from our human clinical studies that we have been working on for the last two years. Prior to making this shift we were focused on selling through our legacy inventory that was at end of life as part of the product shift.  We believe the promotions we ran resulted in pantry loading which impacted revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
The Company's management mandate was to achieve profitability and increase revenue by the end of the 2022 calendar year.  Significant headway was made on cost controls over the last two quarter and we believe additional opportunities to improve our cost structure exist: we are working to lower our facility costs, we are taking further opportunities to improve freight rates, and we continue to reassess our marketing costs and make improvements to our product portfolio.  However, declines in revenue and the corresponding loss in contribution dollars offset operational gains.  As a result, we made changes to our marketing department and in late December 2022 hired a new Chief Marketing Officer that reports to our President. During January of 2023 we began working to improve our communication to customers and more effectively allocate marketing spend to stabilize and rebuild revenues.  Profitability remains a paramount focus and we continue to invest in a strong pipeline of accretive revenue opportunities.
Growth Strategies
We continued to pursue many strategies to grow our revenues and expand the scope of our business in fiscal 2023 and beyond:
●
Product Innovation:
Our goal is to provide our customers superior functional based products with greater efficacy, absorption and efficacy claims. We regularly assess and evaluate our product portfolio, and devote resources to ongoing research and development processes with the goal of improving our product offerings to meet consumer demands. We have a robust pipeline of products to launch during fiscal 2023, including our new clinically proven product cbdMD Max for Pain that launched during the first quarter.
●
Expand our revenue channels:
We believe it is important to have the right product at the right price for the right channel and worked on a bespoke line of products for the food drug and mass channel (“FDM”) that shipped to Wegmans in late fiscal 2022. In September we adjusted our wholesale offer to align with our strongest CBD, best prices consumer offer. We continue to have discussions with key retailers and have expanded our sales organization to include deep channel-specific experience, focused on developing a pipeline of opportunities we believe are strategic to the category and our brand.
●
International Expansion:
We continue to explore sales into markets outside of the United States. Our products are currently available in 31 countries. We generally partner with local wholesalers and local legal counsel who can help navigate the laws and regulatory requirements within their jurisdiction. We continue to pursue key wholesale accounts in several international markets and are gaining market share in Central America through our sanitary registration approvals. We are also expanding our E-commerce business to consumers in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and in March 2022, we received notice that the products we submitted have been validated in the UK as well as in the EU. We continue to work on strategies to continue to expand in the EU, Israel and other major markets which is primarily driven by the regulatory environment.  In late fiscal year 2022, we registered and began selling products in Japan and we are seeing growth during the early part of fiscal 2023.
●
Cultivate our Additional Brands:
We believe there continues to be significant opportunities to enhance Paw CBD and cbdMD Botanicals and our marketing team has begun implementing strategy to better execute on these product lines during 2023.
●
Acquisitions:
We evaluate acquisitions where we believe (i) there is an accretive customer base that can lower our cost of customer acquisitions through either a complementary direct to consumer base or wholesale channels, or (ii) the target has a profitable business or easily attainable cost synergies that can quickly help contribute and accelerate profitability of our Company.

Net Sales
We had total net sales of $6.1 million and $9.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in a quarter over quarter decrease in net sales of $3,.2 million or 34.7%. This decrease is attributable to a decrease of $2.2 million in e-commerce sales and a decrease of $1.0 million in wholesale sales quarter over quarter.  While management is disappointed with the quarter over quarter net sales decrease, the revenue is generally in line with macro competitive trends in the overall CBD industry.  As compared to the immediately preceding quarter, the Company's revenue declined 22.6%.  Our E-commerce sales were impacted during the fourth quarter by  (i) pantry loading of  end of life lower strength SKUs as we discounted ahead of our high-strength product at the end of September 2022, (ii) marketing execution issues with certain vendors that created challenges on Meta and (iii) pull back in marketing spend.  Our Wholesale declined approximately $1.0 million year over year.  We believe there were two main drivers to the decline in our wholesale business: (i) our new lower sales price to wholesalers  and (ii) wholesale customers focused on selling through existing inventory before bringing in our new SKUs.   Further, we believe the current macro inflationary environment continues to impact discretionary spending with consumers as well as wholesale customers.  We continue to work on a pipeline of opportunities both domestically and internationally and believe we will see revenue growth in the coming quarters.

Cost of sales
Our cost of sales includes costs associated with distribution, fill and labor expense, components, manufacturing overhead, third party providers, and freight for our product sales. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 41.8% and 46.4% for three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The changes made during the last quarters have eliminated significant fixed overhead and were aimed at lowering overall costs and making our cost of sale more variable in nature we believe ultimately more predictable.
Operating expenses
Our principal operating expenses include staff related expenses, advertising (which includes expenses related to industry distribution and trade shows), sponsorships, affiliate commissions, merchant fees, technology, travel, rent, professional service fees, and business insurance expenses.

Table of Contents
Our overall operating expenses decreased by $4.3 million or 36.3% three months ended December 31, 2022 over the three months ended December 31, 2021 . The quarter over quarter decrease was primarily driven by management's ongoing efforts to reduce our cost structure including decreases in staff related expenses ($1.4 million), advertising, marketing, sponsorships and affiliate commission expenses ($2.9 million), reduction in stock expense ($1 million), and R&D and regulatory spend ($0.2 million), partially offset by an increase in all other expenses ($0.5 million) and an increase of  ($0.9 million) non-cash expense related to accelerated stock compensation amortization tied the termination of a contractual obligation, and an increase in intangible amortization expense.
Excluding non-cash depreciation, intangible amortization, and non-cash stock expenses, we reduced our cash adjusted operating expenses from $10.4 million to $6.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 respectively.
While we showed strong year over year improvement in our operating expense, we are very focused on our sequential performance and trends in order to get us to a profitable quarter.  We continued to make headway on our cost structure, however gains in our operating costs were offset by loss in revenue during the quarter.  We have continued to lower our operating costs and at the end of January 2023, staffing is down to 65 full-time team members.   In addition we made changes to our marketing team starting in December 2022 and brought in new leadership as well as partners to allow us to consistently navigate Meta advertising rules, improve our messaging, customer acquisition, and rebuild our revenue.  We continue to pursue all avenues that will help lower our costs while maintaining our quality, efficacy and service for our customers; position us for revenue growth; and promote a culture of performance and success.  In addition we have engaged
third parties
to review and assess strategic alternatives for the Company.
Corporate overhead
Included in our consolidated operating expenses are expenses associated with our corporate overhead which are not allocated to the operating business unit, including (i) staff related expenses; (ii) accounting and legal expenses; (iii) professional outside services; (iv) travel and entertainment expenses; (v) rent; (vi) business insurance; and (vii) non-cash stock compensation expense.

The Therapeutic operating expenses include research and development activities for therapeutic applications.  This division was formed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Our human and pet clinical studies have concluded. We started receiving initial results during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and expect final reports during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
Goodwill Impairment
The Company had goodwill at December 31, 2021 of $42,772,685. The Company impaired goodwill in subsequent reporting periods of fiscal 2022 and goodwill was fully impaired by September 30, 2022.
Other income and other non-operating expenses
We also record income and expenses associated with non-operating items. The material components of those are set forth below.
34
Table of Contents
Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on marketable and other securities
We value investments in marketable securities at fair value and record a gain or loss upon sale at each period in realized and unrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $0 and $(33,350), respectively. The realized loss in 2021 was a result of our shares in Isodiol being de-listed.
Decrease in contingent liability
As described in Note 6 to the notes to the consolidated f inancial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, the earn-out provision for the Earnout Shares is accounted for and recorded as a contingent liability with increases in the liability recorded as non-cash other expense and decreases in the liability recorded as non- cash other income. The value of the non-cash contingent liability was $ 215,000  at
December 31, 2022 , as compared to $276,000 at
September 30, 2022 , respectively.  We expect to continue to record changes in the non-cash contingent liability through the balance of the earnout period.
As described in Note 6 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the report, the requirement for the earn-out provision for the Twenty Two Earnout Shares was never met and at September 30, 2022 the balance of this obligation was zero.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $3.4 million and working capital of $6.0 million at December 31, 2022 as compared to cash and cash equivalents on hand of $6.7 million and working capital of $10.7 million at September 30, 2022. Our current assets decreased approximately 20.0% at December 31, 2022 from September 30, 2022, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used to fund operations as well as a one-time non-cash expenses of approximately $885,000 related to previously un-expensed stock amortization related to an terminated contractual obligation. Our current liabilities increased by 5.0% at December 31, 2022 from September 30, 2022, and is primarily attributable to increases in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we used cash primarily to fund our operations.
We do not have any commitments for capital expenditures. We have a commitment for cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 8% payable monthly in arrears for the prior month to our preferred shareholders. We have one endorsement agreement that runs through February 2025 that provides for financial commitments from the Company based on performance/participation (see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies).
While the Company is taking strong action and believes that it can execute it's strategy and path to profitability within it's balance sheet and its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The Company’s working capital position may not be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations for the twelve months subsequent to the issuance of these quarterly financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire additional funding. These and other factors raise potential concern about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date that the quarterly financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.
Our goal from a liquidity perspective is to use operating cash flows to fund day to day operations and we have not met this goal as cash flow from operations has been a net use of $2.1 million and $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management believes the quarterly cash consumption will continue to improve in subsequent quarters.

Critical accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with US GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.
Please see Part II, Item 7 – Critical Accounting Policies appearing in our 2022 10-K for the critical accounting policies we believe involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Please see Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies appearing in the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information on accounting pronouncements.
Off balance sheet arrangements
As of the date of this report, we have no undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our interim principal executive officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim principal executive officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
