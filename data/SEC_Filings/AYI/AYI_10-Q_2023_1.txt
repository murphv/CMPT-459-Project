Principal customers of ABL include electrical distributors, retail home improvement centers, electric utilities, national accounts, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers, digital retailers, lighting showrooms, and energy service companies. Our customers are located in North America and select international markets that serve new construction, renovation and retrofit, and maintenance and repair applications. ABL's lighting and lighting controls solutions are sold primarily through a network of independent sales agencies that cover specific geographic areas and market channels, by internal sales representatives, through consumer retail channels, directly to large corporate accounts, and directly to OEM customers. Products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities or through a network of distribution centers, regional warehouses, and commercial warehouses using both common carriers and a company-managed truck fleet. To serve international customers, our sales forces utilize a variety of distribution methods to meet specific individual customer or country requirements. ABL comprised approximately
95 % of consolidated revenues during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. ISG Segment ISG delivers products and services that make spaces smarter, safer, and greener. ISG offers a building management platform and location-aware applications. Our building management platform includes products for controlling heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”), lighting, shades, and building access that deliver end-to-end optimization of those building systems. Our Atrius ®

software delivers different applications, allows clients to upgrade over time with natural refresh cycles, and deploys new capabilities through both software and hardware updates. Customers of ISG primarily include system integrators as well as retail stores, airports, and enterprise campuses throughout North America and select international locations. ISG products and solutions are marketed under multiple brand names, including but not limited to Distech Controls ®
and Atrius ® . ISG comprised approximately
5 % of consolidated revenues during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. Basis of Presentation We have prepared the
Consolidated Financial Statements
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 4 Table of Contents ACUITY BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position as of November 30, 2022, our consolidated comprehensive income for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, and our consolidated cash flows for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. However, we believe that the disclosures included herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended August 31, 2022 and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 26, 2022 (File No. 001-16583) (“Form 10-K”). The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal 2023 year due primarily to continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may impact our key end markets for the remainder of fiscal 2023; the impact of inflation; component shortages; disruptions in the global supply chain; seasonality; and the impact of any acquisitions and/or divestitures, among other reasons. We are uncertain of the future impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or recovery of prior deterioration in economic conditions to our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution as well as overall construction, renovation, and consumer spending. Additionally, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and other penalties imposed by countries across the globe against Russia are creating substantial uncertainty in the global economy. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine and do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, we are unable to predict the impact that these actions will have on the global economy or on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of the date of these financial statements. Note 2 —
Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. No material reclassifications occurred during the current period. Note 3 —
Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions There were
no
acquisitions during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Divestitures During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we committed to a plan to sell our Sunoptics prismatic skylights business. We completed the sale of the business on November 10, 2022, and we transferred assets with a total carrying value of $ 15.1  million, which primarily consisted of intangibles with definite lives, inventories, and allocated goodwill from the ABL segment. We recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $ 11.2  million within
Miscellaneous expense, net
on the
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Additionally, we recorded impairment charges for certain retained assets as well as associate severance and other costs related to the sale. These items are included within
Special charges
on the
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . See the
Special Charges

New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”) In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2021-08, which requires companies to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination as if the acquiring company originated the related revenue contracts. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, or our fiscal 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impacts of ASU 2021-08 to determine whether we will adopt early or in fiscal 2024. Amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis from the date of adoption. We will apply the provisions of ASU 2021-08 after adoption to future acquisitions, if any. All other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. Note 5 —
Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC 820”), establishes a three-level hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3). We utilize valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of “exit price” and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820. All valuation methods and assumptions are validated at least quarterly to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the fair values. There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period. In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence. Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value We used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $ 284.1
million and $ 223.2
million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. We hold a small number of strategic investments totaling $ 12.0
million and $ 11.9
million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. These investments are primarily equity instruments in privately-held entities over which we do not exercise significant influence or control. We generally account for these investments at fair value on a recurring basis; however, these investments do not have readily determinable fair value. We have elected the practical expedient in ASC Topic 321,
Investments—Equity Securities , to measure these investments at cost less any impairment adjusted for observable price changes, if any. As such, these investments are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair values of these financial instruments during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were not material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Disclosures of Fair Value of Financial Instruments Disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC Topic 825,
Financial Instruments
(“ASC 825”). In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. 6 Table of Contents ACUITY BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Fair value for our outstanding debt obligations is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2). Our senior unsecured public notes are carried at the outstanding balance, net of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs, as of the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of our senior unsecured public notes was $ 388.4  million and $ 399.2  million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in fair value is due to increases in market bond yields since the end of fiscal 2022. We had
no
short-term borrowings and $ 18.0  million of short-term borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. These borrowings are variable-rate instruments that reset on a frequent short-term basis; therefore, we estimate that any outstanding carrying values, which are equal to the face amounts, of these instruments approximate their fair values. See
Debt and Lines of Credit
footnote for further details on our outstanding borrowings. ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to us. In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the disclosed value be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. In evaluating our management of liquidity and other risks, the fair values of all assets and liabilities should be taken into consideration, not only those presented above. Note 6 —
Inventories Inventories include materials, direct labor, inbound freight, customs, duties, tariffs, and related manufacturing overhead. Inventories are stated on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost and net realizable value and consist of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):   November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Raw materials, supplies, and work in process
(1) $ 272.3   $ 252.6   Finished goods 245.1   264.0   Inventories excluding reserves 517.4   516.6   Less: Reserves ( 30.4 ) ( 30.9 ) Total inventories $ 487.0   $ 485.7   _______________________________________ (1)
Due to the immaterial amount of estimated work in process and the short lead times for the conversion of raw materials to finished goods, we do not believe the segregation of raw materials and work in process is meaningful information. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period the change occurs.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Through multiple acquisitions, we acquired definite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of customer relationships, patented technology, distribution networks, and trademarks and trade names associated with specific products, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. We recorded amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets of $ 13.6
million and $ 10.3
million during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $ 41.5
million in fiscal 2023, $ 36.9
million in fiscal 2024, $ 29.4
million in fiscal 2025, $ 26.7

Debt and Lines of Credit Long-term Debt On November 10, 2020, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. issued $ 500.0
million aggregate principal amount of
2.150 % senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2030 (the “Unsecured Notes”). The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands, Inc. and ABL IP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of
2.150 % per annum and were issued at a price equal to
99.737 % of their face value. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands, Inc. and ABL IP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. Additionally, we recorded $ 4.8
million of deferred issuance costs related to the Unsecured Notes as a direct deduction from the face amount of the Unsecured Notes. These issuance costs are amortized over the
10-year
term of the Unsecured Notes.
Lines of Credit On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $ 600.0
million
five-year
unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with the ability to request an additional $ 400.0
million of borrowing capacity. We had
no
short-term borrowings at November 30, 2022 and $ 18.0
million in short-term borrowings at August 31, 2022 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility uses the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the applicable benchmark for U.S. Dollar borrowings and an applicable benchmark rate for non-U.S. Dollar borrowings as defined in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin pricing grid mechanics are based on the better of our public credit ratings or our net leverage ratio and range from
0.80 % to
1.20 % for base rate borrowings and from
0.00 % to
0.20 % for floating rate advances. We are also required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative service fees and annual facility fees, which range from
0.075 % to
0.175 % of the aggregate $ 600.0  million remaining commitment of the lenders under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains a leverage ratio covenant (“Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Credit Agreement generally allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of
3.75
(subject to a temporary increase to
4.25
in the event of a significant acquisition) and allows netting of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents against debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2022. At November 30, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $ 595.9
million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $ 4.1
million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs. Borrowings and repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility with terms of three months or less are reported on a net basis on our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net , is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, line of credit borrowings, and loans that are secured by and presented net of company-owned life insurance policies on our

Commitments and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to the effects of certain contractual stipulations, events, transactions, and laws and regulations that may, at times, require the recognition of liabilities, such as those related to self-insurance estimated liabilities and claims, legal and contractual issues, environmental laws and regulations, guarantees, and indemnities. We establish estimated liabilities when the associated costs related to uncertainties or guarantees become probable and can be reasonably estimated. For the period ended November 30, 2022, no material changes have occurred in our estimated liabilities for self-insurance, litigation, environmental matters, guarantees and indemnities, or relevant events and circumstances, from those disclosed in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
within our Form 10-K other than the items discussed below. Product Warranty and Recall Costs
Our products generally have a standard warranty term of
five years
that assures our products comply with agreed upon specifications. We record an accrual for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized. Estimated future warranty and recall costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty and recall claims. Estimated costs related to product warranty and recall costs outside of our historical experience, which could include significant product recalls or formal campaigns soliciting repair or return of a product, are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Any estimated or actual loss recoveries that offset our costs and payments are reflected as assets and included within
Other current assets
or
Other long-term assets
on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets
based on the expected timing of receipt of recovery. There can be no assurance that future warranty or recall costs will not exceed historical amounts or that new technology products may not generate unexpected costs. If actual future warranty or recall costs exceed historical amounts, additional increases in the accrual may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Estimated liabilities for product warranty and recall costs are included in
Other accrued liabilities
and
Other long-term liabilities
on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets
based upon when we expect to settle the incurred warranty. The following table summarizes changes in the estimated liabilities for product warranty and recall costs during the periods presented (in millions): Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Beginning balance $ 27.3   $ 20.3   Warranty and recall costs 3.7   4.4   Payments and other deductions ( 8.6 ) ( 4.5 ) Ending balance $ 22.4   $ 20.2   Shareholder Derivative Complaint As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2021, certain alleged shareholders of the Company filed a putative derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia asserting claims against
three
former executives for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other claims (the “Derivative Complaint”). The Company is named as a nominal defendant, and the plaintiffs seek on behalf of the Company unspecified damages from the
10 Table of Contents ACUITY BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) individual defendants and other relief. Prior to filing the Derivative Complaint, the derivative plaintiffs sent letters to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) demanding that the Company investigate and pursue substantially the same claims against the individual defendants that are asserted in the Derivative Complaint. The Company’s Board formed a demand evaluation committee consisting of independent directors to investigate these matters and make a recommendation to the Board regarding the best interests of the Company in connection therewith. On December 14, 2021, the Company filed a motion to stay the derivative action pending the conclusion of the related securities class action or, in the alternative, to dismiss the derivative action without prejudice as premature, given the demand evaluation committee’s ongoing work. Also on December 14, 2021, the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Derivative Complaint for failure to adequately plead any claim for relief against them.
On August 3, 2022, the Court entered a stipulated consent order extending the deadline for the individual defendants and the Company to answer, move against, or otherwise respond to the Derivative Complaint until thirty days after the filing of an amended complaint or the designation of an operative complaint. Subsequently, the demand evaluation committee completed its investigation and recommended that the Board reject the demands and direct the Company to seek dismissal of the Derivative Complaint. The Board approved and adopted the recommendation from the committee and rejected the demands and directed the Company to seek dismissal of the Derivative Complaint. The parties advised the Court of the Board’s decision during the status conference held on October 6, 2022. The Court directed the parties to submit a written status report within
forty-five days
as to the litigation. The parties subsequently negotiated a Stipulated Confidentially Agreement, which was filed with the Court on October 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Stipulated Confidentiality Agreement and Order, the Company produced the demand evaluation committee report and recommendation regarding the claims asserted in the Derivative Complaint, along with exhibits, to the plaintiffs for review. On December 21, 2022, the parties filed a joint status report notifying the Court that the plaintiffs had completed their review of the demand evaluation committee report and that the parties expect to update the Court by January 20, 2023 regarding the next steps in the litigation. Data Security Incidents On December 14, 2022, a former employee filed a putative class action complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on behalf of all persons whose personal information was compromised as a result of data security incidents we experienced in October 2020 and/or December 2021.
The plaintiff alleges that the Company failed to exercise reasonable caution in securing and safeguarding her and the other putative class members’ personal information, and on that basis, asserts claims for negligence, breach of contract, breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty.
The plaintiff seeks class certification, unspecified monetary damages, certain injunctive relief regarding our data-security measures, additional credit-monitoring services, other equitable relief (including disgorgement), attorneys’ fees, costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.
We dispute the allegations in the complaint and, given the recency of the lawsuit, are planning our response strategy, which we currently expect to include a vigorous defense of the claims.
Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the early stages of the proceedings where key evidential and legal issues have not been resolved.
In addition, we have received inquiries from, and it is also possible that investigations or other actions are taken by, state and/or federal agencies regarding the data security incidents and related data privacy matters.
For these reasons, we are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matters described above. We have insurance, subject to certain terms and conditions, for these types of matters. Litigation We are subject to various other legal claims arising in the normal course of business, including patent infringement, employment matters, and product liability claims. Based on information currently available, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. We establish estimated liabilities for legal claims when associated costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued for such claims.
11 Table of Contents ACUITY BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) However, we cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the accrued amounts. Note 12 —

Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when we transfer control of goods and services to our customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for goods and services and is recognized net of allowances for rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers. We allocate the expected consideration to be collected to each distinct performance obligation identified in a sale based on its standalone selling price. Sales and use taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. Further details regarding revenue recognition are included within the

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly but reflects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive options were exercised, all unvested share-based payment awards were vested, and other distributions related to deferred stock agreements were incurred. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of share-based payment awards subject to market and/or performance conditions that were not met during the period are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The following table calculates basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the periods presented (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Net income $ 74.9   $ 87.6   Basic weighted average shares outstanding 32.308   35.063   Common stock equivalents 0.396   0.476   Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 32.704   35.539   Basic earnings per share (1) $ 2.32   $ 2.50   Diluted earnings per share (1) $ 2.29   $ 2.46   _______________________________________ (1)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Acuity Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” or similar references) and its subsidiaries as of November 30, 2022 and for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included within this report. Also, please refer to Acuity Brands, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 26, 2022 (“Form 10-K”). Overview Company We are a market-leading industrial technology company. We use technology to solve problems in spaces and light. Through our two business segments, Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls (“ABL”) and the Intelligent Spaces Group (“ISG”), we design, manufacture, and bring to market products and services that make a valuable difference in people's lives. We achieve growth through the development of innovative new products and services, including lighting, lighting controls, building management systems, and location-aware applications. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal 2023 year due primarily to continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may impact our key end markets for fiscal 2023; the impact of inflation; component shortages; disruptions in the global supply chain; seasonality; and the impact of any acquisitions and/or divestitures, among other reasons. We are uncertain of the future impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or recovery of prior deterioration in economic conditions to our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution as well as overall construction, renovation, and consumer spending. Additionally, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and other penalties imposed by countries across the globe against Russia are creating substantial uncertainty in the global economy. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine and do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, we are unable to predict the impact that these actions will have on the global economy or on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of the date of these financial statements. Financial Condition, Capital Resources, and Liquidity We have numerous sources of capital, including cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations, as well as various sources of financing. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to meet our capital allocation priorities, which are to invest in our current business for growth, to invest in mergers and acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to make share repurchases. Sufficient cash flow generation is also critical to fund our operations in the short and long terms and to maintain compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements. Our significant contractual cash requirements primarily include principal and interest on our unsecured notes and borrowings under our credit agreement, payments for operating lease liabilities, and certain purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding. Our obligations related to these items are described further within
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
within our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. We believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements. Additionally, we believe that our cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and borrowing capacity, will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional capital, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Cash Our cash position at November 30, 2022 was $284.1 million, an increase of $60.9 million from August 31, 2022. Cash generated from operating activities and cash on hand were used during the current year to fund our capital allocation priorities as discussed below. We generated $186.6 million of cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended November 30,
18 Table of Contents 2022, compared with $83.7 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $102.9 million. This increase was due primarily to increased cash collections from customers and fewer inventory purchases during the current period as well as the timing of quarterly income tax payments. Financing Arrangements See the
Debt and Lines of Credit

for discussion of our various financing arrangements, including the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.150% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2030 (the “Unsecured Notes”) as well as the terms of our $600.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”).
At November 30, 2022, our outstanding debt balance was $495.1 million, which consisted solely of our Unsecured Notes, compared to our cash position of $284.1 million. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under our financing arrangements as of November 30, 2022. At November 30, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $595.9 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $4.1 million issued under the facility. As of November 30, 2022, our cash on hand combined with the additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled $880.0 million. The Unsecured Notes were issued by Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands, Inc. and ABL IP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The following tables present summarized financial information for Acuity Brands, Inc., Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., and ABL IP Holding LLC on a combined basis after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions between the combined group as well as any investments in non-guarantors as of the dates and during the period presented (in millions): Summarized Balance Sheet Information November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Current assets $ 1,021.0  $ 1,056.6  Amounts due from non-guarantor affiliates 300.9  280.2  Non-current assets 1,385.0  1,414.3  Current liabilities 593.3  620.4  Non-current liabilities 822.7  821.0  Summarized Income Statement Information Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 Net sales $ 845.4  Gross profit 347.0  Net income 63.3  Capital Allocation Priorities Our capital allocation priorities are to invest in our current business for growth, to invest in mergers and acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to make share repurchases.
Investments in Current Business for Growth We invested $18.2 million and $9.3 million in property, plant, and equipment during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We invested more in fiscal 2023 primarily for investments in new and enhanced equipment and tooling. Strategic Acquisitions, Investments, and Divestitures We seek opportunities to strategically expand and enhance our portfolio of solutions. There were no acquisitions during the first three months of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we committed to a plan to sell our Sunoptics prismatic skylights business, which we completed on November 10, 2022. We recognized a loss of $11.2 million on the sale of the business.

All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and are evaluated regularly in light of our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors the Board deems relevant. Share Repurchases During the first three months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $77.6 million. Total cash outflows for share repurchases during the three months ended November 30, 2022 were $76.5 million. We expect to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis subject to various factors including stock price, Company performance, market conditions, and other possible uses of cash. As of November 30, 2022, the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board equaled 2.4 million shares. The COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent worldwide government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services resulting in increased volatility in and disruptions to global markets. We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and their families and ensuring that we operate effectively. We have implemented various health and safety policies and processes at our facilities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and other locations as permitted by law.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our results of operations. The pandemic has caused reduced construction and renovation spending as well as a disruption in our supply chain for certain components, both of which negatively impacted our operating results. Although our facilities are open, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including as a result of new variants, may lead to the reimposition of previously lifted business closure requirements, the imposition of new restrictions, or the issuance of new or revised local or national health guidance. We also continue to incur additional health and safety costs including expenditures for personal protection equipment and facility enhancements to maintain proper distancing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have taken actions to reduce costs, including the realignment of headcount with volumes, a limit on all non-essential employee travel, other efforts to decrease discretionary spending, and reductions in our real estate footprint. Additionally, we elected to defer certain employer payroll taxes as allowable under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES” Act) signed into law on March 27, 2020. We paid half of these deferrals in December 2021 and the other half in December 2022. Although we have implemented significant measures to mitigate further spread of the virus, our employees, customers, suppliers, and contractors may continue to experience disruptions to business activities due to potential further government-mandated or voluntary shutdowns, general economic conditions, or other negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuously monitoring the adverse effects of the pandemic and identifying steps to mitigate those effects. As the COVID-19 pandemic is continually evolving, we are uncertain of its ultimate duration and impact. See
Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors
of our Form 10-K for further details regarding the potential impacts of COVID-19 to our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations First Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Compared with First Quarter of Fiscal 2022
The following table sets forth information comparing the components of net income for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 (in millions except per share data): Three Months Ended   November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Increase (Decrease)   Percent Change Net sales $ 997.9  $ 926.1  $ 71.8  7.8  % Cost of products sold 581.4  540.3  41.1  7.6  % Gross profit 416.5  385.8  30.7  8.0  % Percent of net sales 41.7  % 41.7  % —  bps   Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses 300.7  270.7  30.0    11.1  % Special charges 6.9  —  6.9  NM Operating profit 108.9  115.1  (6.2)   (5.4)  % Percent of net sales 10.9  % 12.4  % (150) bps   Other expense:           Interest expense, net 6.6  5.9  0.7    11.9  % Miscellaneous expense, net 9.1  0.3  8.8    NM Total other expense 15.7  6.2  9.5    153.2  % Income before income taxes 93.2  108.9  (15.7) (14.4)  % Percent of net sales 9.3  % 11.8  % (250) bps Income tax expense 18.3  21.3  (3.0) (14.1)  % Effective tax rate 19.6  % 19.6  %       Net income $ 74.9  $ 87.6  $ (12.7) (14.5)  % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.29  $ 2.46  $ (0.17) (6.9)  % NM - not meaningful Net Sales Net sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022 increased $71.8 million, or 7.8%, to $997.9 million, compared with $926.1 million in the prior-year period. Both our ABL and ISG segments benefited from recent price increases as well as favorable mix. Changes in foreign currency rates and the divestiture from our Sunoptics prismatic skylight business did not have a meaningful impact on net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross Profit Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $30.7 million, or 8.0%, to $416.5 million, compared with $385.8 million in the prior-year period, while gross profit margin remained flat at 41.7% compared with the prior-year period. Our gross profit margin remained flat with the prior year as we were able to offset material, labor, and other cost escalations with price and favorable mix. Operating Profit Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses ("SD&A") expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2022 were $300.7 million, compared with $270.7 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $30.0 million, or 11.1%. The increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to higher commissions and freight costs associated with higher sales. Amortization expense of definite-lived intangibles increased in fiscal 2023 as we recorded $4.0 million of accelerated amortization for intangibles associated with certain brands that were discontinued. We recognized special charges of $6.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please refer to the
Special Charges
footnote of the
Note to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further details. Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $108.9 million (10.9% of net sales), compared with $115.1 million (12.4% of net sales) for the prior-year period, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 5.4%. The operating profit margin
21 Table of Contents decrease of 150 bps year over year was due primarily to higher special charges, commission rates, and amortization expense. Other Expense Other expense consists of net interest expense and net miscellaneous expense, which includes non-service related components of net periodic pension cost, gains and losses associated with foreign currency-related transactions, and non-operating gains and losses.
Interest expense, net, was $6.6 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We reported net miscellaneous expense of $9.1 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year change in net miscellaneous expense was largely due to the $11.2 million loss of the sale of the Sunoptics prismatic skylights business, the details of which are described in the
Acquisitions and Divestitures
footnote of the
Note to Consolidated Financial Statements.
This loss was partially offset by higher gains on foreign currency-related items compared to the prior year. Income Taxes and Net Income Our effective income tax rate was 19.6% for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 and reflects favorable discrete items recognized in both periods. Net income for the three months ended November 30, 2022 decreased $12.7 million, or 14.5%, to $74.9 million, from $87.6 million reported for the prior-year period. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from $22.1 million in combined losses and special charges recognized from the Sunoptics sale and other restructuring activities as well as accelerated amortization of intangible assets. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2022 decreased $0.17, or 6.9%, to $2.29 compared with diluted earnings per share of $2.46 for the prior-year period. This decrease reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower outstanding diluted shares.
Segment Results The following table sets forth information comparing the operating results of our segments, ABL and ISG, for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 (in millions).
Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change ABL:
Net sales $ 947.1  $ 883.6  $ 63.5  7.2  % Operating profit 118.1  128.1  (10.0) (7.8)  % Operating profit margin 12.5  % 14.5  % (200) bps ISG:
Net sales $ 56.8  $ 46.4  $ 10.4  22.4  % Operating profit 7.7  2.0  5.7  285.0  % Operating profit margin 13.6  % 4.3  % 930 bps ABL net sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022 increased $63.5 million, or 7.2%, to $947.1 million, compared with $883.6 million in the
prior-year period. Sales within the ABL segment benefited from recent price increases as well as favorable mix year over year. Operating profit for ABL was $118.1 million (12.5% of ABL net sales) for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared with $128.1 million (14.5% of ABL net sales) in the prior-year period, a decrease of $10.0 million. The decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the recognition of special charges of $6.9 million attributed to the segment in the current period, the acceleration of amortization for definite-lived intangibles related to brands that were discontinued, and increased commission rates. ISG net sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022 increased $10.4 million, or 22.4%, to $56.8 million, compared with $46.4 million in the prior-year period, driven primarily by strong demand for building management controls, improved component availability, and price increases. ISG operating profit was $7.7 million for the three
22 Table of Contents months ended November 30, 2022, compared with $2.0 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $5.7 million. This increase was due primarily to contributions from higher sales, partially offset by increased employee costs.
Critical Accounting Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements , which have been prepared in accordance U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). As discussed in the
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
footnote of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; inventory valuation; goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; share-based payment expense; and product warranty and recall costs. We base our estimates and judgments on our substantial historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a recurring basis. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the current period. For a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment, refer to our Form 10-K. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information This filing contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements use words such as “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “indicative,” “projection,” “predict,” “plan,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “potential,” and words of similar meaning, as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions, or circumstances. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Act. Statements that describe or relate to the Company’s plans, goals, intentions, strategies, or financial outlook, and statements that do not relate to historical or current fact, are examples of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Our forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, which may not prove to be accurate, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and management’s present expectations or projections.These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K (including, but not limited to,
Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors ), quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect any events or circumstances after the date of this quarterly report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risks that may impact our
Consolidated Balance Sheets ,
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income,
and
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. There have been no material changes to our exposure from market risks from those disclosed in
Part II, Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
of our Form 10-K. 23 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by SEC rules, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2022. However, because all disclosure procedures must rely to a significant degree on actions or decisions made by employees throughout the organization, such as reporting of material events, the Company and its reporting officers believe that they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or errors and omissions, if any, within the Company will be detected. Limitations within any control system, including our control system, include faulty judgments in decision-making or simple errors or mistakes. In addition, controls can be circumvented by an individual, by collusion between two or more people, or by management override of the control. Because of these limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On March 31, 2022, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock. Under the current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices, depending on market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. No date has been established for the completion of the share repurchase program, and we are not obligated to repurchase any shares. Subject to applicable corporate securities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. Repurchases under the program can be discontinued at any time management feels additional repurchases are not warranted. As of November 30, 2022, the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board equaled 2.4 million shares. The following table reflects activity related to equity securities we repurchased during the quarter ended November 30, 2022:
