AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS    Luvu Brands, Inc. (the “Company” or “Luvu”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999. References to the Company in these notes include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, OneUp Innovations, Inc. (“OneUp”), and Foam Labs, Inc. (“Foam Labs”). All operations of the Company are currently conducted by OneUp.   The Company is an Atlanta, Georgia based designer, manufacturer and marketer of a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands including: Liberator ® , a brand category of iconic products for enhancing sexual performance; Avana ®
inclined bed therapy products, assistive in relieving medical conditions associated with acid reflux, surgery recovery and chronic pain; and Jaxx ® , a diverse range of casual fashion daybeds, sofas and beanbags made from polyurethane foam and repurposed polyurethane foam trim. These products are sold through the Company’s websites, online mass merchants and retail stores worldwide. Many of our products are offered flat-packed and either roll or vacuum compressed to save on shipping and reduce our carbon footprint.
Sales are generated through internet and print advertisements and social marketing.  We have a diversified customer base with only one customer accounting for
10 % or more of consolidated net sales in the current and prior fiscal year and no particular concentration of credit risk in one economic sector.  Foreign operations and foreign net sales are not material. Our business is seasonal and as a result we typically experience higher sales in our second and third fiscal quarters.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The year-end condensed balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 14, 2022 (the “2022 10-K”).   NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   These consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, OneUp and Foam Labs. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  These consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s 2022 10-K.   Use of Estimates    The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates of: income taxes; deferred tax allowance; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory valuation and allowances; share-based compensation; and useful lives for depreciation and amortization.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.        8 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   Revenue Recognition      We record revenue based on the five-step model which includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Substantially all of our revenue is generated by fulfilling orders for the purchase of manufactured products and product purchased for resale to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to consumers via online channels, with each order considered to be a distinct performance obligation. These orders may be formal purchase orders, verbal phone orders, e-mail orders or orders received online. Shipping and handling activities for which we are responsible under the terms and conditions of the order are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill our promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized. The impact of this policy election is insignificant as it aligns with our current practice.   Revenue is measured as the net amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilling a performance obligation. We have elected to exclude sales, use and similar taxes from the measurement of the transaction price.  The impact of this policy election is insignificant, as it aligns with our current practice. The amount of consideration expected to be received and revenue recognized includes estimates of variable consideration, which includes costs for trade promotion programs, coupons, returns and early payment discounts.  Such estimates are calculated using historical averages adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions and experience. We review and update these estimates at the end of each reporting period and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. In assessing whether collection of consideration from a customer is probable, we consider the customer's ability and intent to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. Payment of invoices is due as specified in the underlying customer agreement, typically 30 days from the invoice date, which occurs on the date of transfer of control of the products to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the point in time that control of the ordered products is transferred to the customer. Generally, this occurs when the product is delivered, or in some cases, picked up from one of our distribution centers by the customer.    Deferred revenues   Deferred revenues are recorded when the Company has received consideration (i.e. advance payment) before satisfying its performance obligations. Deferred revenues primarily relate to gift cards purchased, but not used, prior to the end of the fiscal period. During the six months ending December 31, 2022, we reclassified credit balances in accounts receivable of ($ 106,000 ) to deferred revenue.   Our total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2022 was $ 243,944
and was included in “Other accrued liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $ 17,888 .   Cost of Goods Sold   Cost of goods sold includes raw materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, and royalty expense.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.     9 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of current and past due receivable balances that may not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable and our history of bad debts. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the receivable balance under current conditions. However, significant deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, could materially change these expectations and an additional allowance may be required.   The following is a summary of Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.       December 31,

) Total accounts receivable, net   $ 947     $ 1,192     (1) During the six months ending December 31, 2022 we reclassified credit balances in accounts receivable of ($106,000) to deferred revenue. For the period ending June 30, 2022, accounts receivable and deferred revenue were adjusted by ($85,000) for comparability only. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow was adjusted accordingly to reflect these reclassifications.   Inventories and Inventory Reserves   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost to dispose and a normal profit margin.  Inventory costs include materials, labor, depreciation and overhead. The Company establishes allowances for excess and obsolete inventory, based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events, such as economic conditions, that may affect inventory. The reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value may be adjusted in response to changing conditions.   Concentration of Credit Risk   The Company maintains its cash accounts with banks located in Georgia.  The total cash balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $ 250,000
per bank. The Company had bank balances on deposit at December 31, 2022 that exceeded the balance insured by the FDIC by $ 1,837,756 . Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in North America and Europe.   During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we purchased
35 % and
35 % respectively, of total inventory purchases from one vendor.   During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we purchased
34 % of total inventory purchases from one vendor.   As of December 31, 2022, two of the Company’s customers represents
35 % and
18 % of the total accounts receivables, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, two of the Company’s customers represents
21 % and
13 % of the total accounts receivables, respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, sales to and through Amazon accounted for
34 % and
36 % of our net sales, respectively.     10 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, our financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, and other long-term debt.   The fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values based on either their short maturity or current terms for similar instruments.   The Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities under the guidance of
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but its provisions apply to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement.   ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 requires the Company to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:   Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;   Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs; and   Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.   The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:   A.
Market approach
- Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.   B.
Income approach
- Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts, including present value techniques, option-pricing models and excess earnings method.   C.
Cost approach
- Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).   Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed in the period when the advertisements are first aired or distributed to the public. Prepaid advertising (included in prepaid expenses) was $ 687
at December 31, 2022 and $ 1,050
at June 30, 2022. Advertising expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 199,504
and $ 154,876 , respectively. Advertising expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 386,498
and $ 286,766 , respectively.     11 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   Research and Development   Research and development expenses for new products are expensed as they are incurred. Expenses for new product development totaled $ 36,418
and $ 32,482
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expenses for new product development totaled $ 67,368
and $ 60,805
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development costs are included in general and administrative expense.   Equipment and leasehold Improvements   Equipment and Leasehold Improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over estimated service lives for financial reporting purposes of
2 - 10
years.   Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When properties are disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized that time.   Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets   Long-lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. They are tested for recoverability using undiscounted cash flows to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) ASC Topic No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment . The Company has determined that there was no impairment at December 31, 2022.   Operating Leases    On November 2, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with its landlord on a new lease for the current facilities for six years and two months, beginning January 1, 2021. The new lease includes two months of rent abatement totaling $ 103,230 . Under the new lease, the monthly rent on the facility is $ 51,615
with annual escalations of
3 % with the final two months of rent at $ 61,605 . In addition, the Company will pay the landlord a
2 % property management fee. The rent expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 163,188
and $ 163,188
respectively. The rent expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 326,376
and $ 326,376
respectively.
Under ASC 842, which was adopted July 1, 2019, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company elected not to recognize leases with a term less than one year on its balance sheet. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.   In accordance with the guidance in ASU 2016-02, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.) Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense. See Note 16 for details.   Under prior guidance ASC 840, rent expense and lease incentives from operating leases were recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between rent expense recognized and rental payments was recorded as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.     12 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   Recent accounting pronouncements   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements, but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.   Net Income Per Share   In accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”, basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of stock options using the treasury stock method. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the common stock equivalents did not have any effect on net income per share.       December 31,       2022     2021   Common stock options – 2015 Plan     1,450,000       2,350,000   Convertible preferred stock     4,300,000       4,300,000     Total     5,750,000       6,650,000     Income Taxes   We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period. If we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination. We expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets.   Stock Based Compensation   We account for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with
FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation.
We measure the cost of each stock option and restricted stock award at its fair value on the grant date. Each award vests over the subsequent period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). The cost of each award is recognized as expense in the financial statements over the respective vesting period.   NOTE 3. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
We follow
FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , regarding impairment of our other long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment). Our policy is to assess our long-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.    An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of a long-lived asset.     14 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)     Assets to be disposed of and related liabilities would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Assets to be disposed of would be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and would not be depreciated.  There was no impairment as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.   NOTE 4. INVENTORIES, NET   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (which approximates first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost to dispose and a normal profit margin.  Inventories consisted of the following:        December 31, 2022     June 30, 2022       (unaudited)       (in thousands)   Raw materials   $ 2,158     $ 1,893   Work in process     561       440   Finished goods     1,388       1,660   Total inventories     4,107       3,993   Allowance for slow moving inventory

and $ 148,513 , respectively.   Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to forecasted undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. Management has determined no asset impairment occurred during the six months ended December 31, 2022.     15 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC.

LINE OF CREDIT   The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, OneUp and OneUp’s wholly owned subsidiary, Foam Labs has entered into a credit facility with a finance company, Advance Financial Corporation dated May 24, 2011, as amended, to provide it with an asset based line of credit of up to $ 1,200,000
against
85% of eligible accounts receivable (as defined in the agreement) for the purpose of improving working capital
and includes an Inventory Advance (as defined in the agreement) of up to the lesser of $ 500,000
or
125 % of the eligible accounts receivable loan. The term of the agreement was one year, renewable for additional one year terms unless either party provides written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the current financing period. The credit facility is secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment, general intangibles, inventory and equipment, and are subject to eligibility requirements for current accounts receivable. Advances under the agreement are currently charged interest at a rate of prime rate plus
2 % over the lenders Index Rate. In addition, there is a Monthly Service Fee (as defined in the agreement) of currently 0.05 % per month.
The Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and majority shareholder. Louis Friedman, has personally guaranteed the repayment of the facility. In addition, the Company has provided its corporate guarantee of the credit facility (see Note 14). On December 31, 2022, the balance owed under this line of credit was $ 905,410 . As of December 31, 2022, we were current and in compliance with all terms and conditions of this line of credit.
Management believes cash flows generated from operations, along with current cash and investments as well as borrowing capacity under the line of credit should be sufficient to finance capital requirements required by operations. If new business opportunities do arise, additional outside funding may be required.   NOTE 11. UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT     The Company has drawn a cash advance on an unsecured line of credit that is in the name of the Company and Louis S. Friedman. The terms of this unsecured line of credit calls for monthly payments of principal and interest, with interest at
12.25 %. The aggregate amount owed on the unsecured line of credit was $ 18,942
at December 31, 2022 and $ 24,879
at June 30, 2022.   NOTE 12. SECURED NOTE PAYABLE   On February 17, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Amazon, whereby Amazon agreed to loan OneUp a total of $ 200,000 . Repayment of this note is by
12 monthly payments
of $ 17,675 , which includes interest at
10.99 %. This loan was repaid in full on February 17, 2022.     18 Table of Contents   LUVU BRANDS, INC.

Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $8,135,000, a 13.2% increase from the comparable prior year period.  The major components of net sales, by product, are as follows:     · Liberator sales -
Sales of Liberator branded products increased $1,601,000, or 49%, during the quarter from the comparable prior year period, due primarily to higher sales through the Company’s e-commerce site, Liberator.com, and higher sales through Amazon.     · Jaxx sales –
Jaxx product sales decreased 11% from the prior year second quarter to $2,088,000, primarily due to reallocating our production resources to fulfill increased demand for the Liberator products.     · Avana sales –
Net sales of Avana products decreased 31% during the quarter from the comparable prior year quarter to $542,000. Sales of this product line have been impacted by lower-priced competitive products in the marketplace, production constraints which resulted in longer delivery lead times which resulted in lower sales through drop ship channels including Amazon, Overstock and Wayfair.     · Products purchased for resale –
This product category decreased by 24%, or $120,000, from the prior year second quarter due to lower sales of certain products through our e-commerce website, Liberator.com.
Gross margin .
Gross profit, derived from net sales less the cost of goods sold, includes the cost of materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, freight costs, royalties and depreciation. Gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28% from 22% in the prior year second quarter. Gross profit increased to $2,259,000 from $1,577,000 in the prior year second quarter.   Operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 18% of net sales, or approximately $1,476,000, compared to 19% of net sales, or approximately $1,326,000, for the same period in the prior year.     Other income (expense) .
Interest expense during the second quarter increased slightly from approximately ($84,000) in fiscal 2021 to approximately ($88,000) during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing balances.   Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2021   Net sales . Sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $16,195,000, a 21% increase from the $13,411,000 recorded in the comparable prior year period.  The major components of net sales, by product, are as follows:     · Liberator sales -
Sales of Liberator branded products increased $3,967,000, or 66%, during the first six months from the comparable prior year period, due primarily to greater sales through the company’s Liberator.com website and through Amazon.com;     · Jaxx sales –
Jaxx product sales decreased $358,000, or 8%, from the prior year first half, primarily due to reallocating our production resources to fulfill increased demand for the Liberator products;     · Avana sales –
Net sales of Avana products decreased $435,000, or 28%, to $1,096,000 during the first six months from the comparable prior year period. Sales of this product line have been impacted by lower-priced competitive products in the marketplace, production constraints which resulted in longer delivery lead times which resulted in lower sales through drop ship channels including Amazon, Overstock and Wayfair; and     · Products purchased for resale –
This product category decreased by $233,000, or 25%, from the prior year first half due to lower sales of certain products through our e-commerce website, Liberator.com.
26 Table of Contents   Gross margin .
Gross profit, derived from net sales less the cost of goods sold, includes the cost of materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, freight costs and depreciation.  Gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26% from 23% in the prior year first half. Gross profit increased by 38% to $4,232,000 from $3,076,000 in the prior year first six months.   Operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were 18% of net sales, or approximately $2,873,000, compared to 19% of net sales, or approximately $2,502,000, for the same period in the prior year.  Of the $370,000 increase, approximately $126,000 was due to higher advertising expense.   Other income (expense) .
Interest expense during the first six month decreased from expense of approximately ($180,000) in fiscal 2021 to expense of approximately ($171,000) during the first half of fiscal 2022.   Variability of Results   We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods. Operating results have fluctuated as a result of changes in sales levels to consumers and wholesalers, competition, seasonality costs associated with new product introductions, and increases in raw material costs. In addition, future operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control such as foreign exchange fluctuation, changes in government regulations, and economic changes in the regions in which we operate and sell. A portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales. Therefore, if net sales are below expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to meaningfully adjust spending in certain areas, or the inability to adjust spending quickly enough, as in personnel and administrative costs, to compensate for a sales shortfall. We may also choose to increase spending in response to market conditions, and these decisions may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table summarizes our cash flows:             Six Months Ended       December 31,   (Dollars in thousands)   2022     2021       (Unaudited)   Cash flow data:             Cash provided by operating activities   $ 1,402     $ 444   Cash used in investing activities   $ (54
)   $ (46
) Cash used in financing activities   $ (332
)   $ (294
)   As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,875,371, compared to $1,080,564 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021.   For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flow that we generate from our operations, availability of borrowings under our line of credit and cash raised through equity and debt financings.   Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,402,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $444,000 net cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2021.  The primary components of the cash provided by operating activities in the current year is the net income of $1,188,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of $159,000, offset in part by an increase in inventory of $114,000, and a decrease in accounts payable of $61,000.     27 Table of Contents   Investing Activities   Cash used in investing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $54,000 and related to the purchase and installation of certain production equipment during the period.   Financing Activities   Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $332,000 was primarily attributable to the repayment of the line of credit and payments made on equipment notes.    Inflation   During fiscal 2022, we experienced increases in various raw material costs and increases in labor and transportation costs. These cost pressures have not stabilized and we anticipate they will continue to increase throughout fiscal 2023, although there is no assurance this will occur. Furthermore, if our customers reduce their levels of spending in response to increases in retail prices and/or we are unable to pass such cost increases to our customers, our revenues and our profit margins may decrease.    Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:    (Dollars in thousands)   Six months ended December 31,       2022     2021   Net income   $ 1,188     $ 394   Plus interest expense, net     172       180   Plus depreciation and amortization expense     175       149   Plus stock-based compensation     22       10   Adjusted EBITDA
$ 1,557     $ 733     As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. We have excluded the non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation, as they do not reflect the cash-based operations of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including the net income of the Company or net cash provided by operating activities.   Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the Company’s net income or net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP and are not a substitute for or a measure of the Company’s profitability or net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance and liquidity, and because it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor do we use other forms of off-balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.   Critical accounting policies   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances and impairment of long-lived assets.
