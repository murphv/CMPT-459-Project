REV Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
(All tabular amounts presented in millions, except share and per share amounts)
Note 1. Basis of Presentation The Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of REV Group, Inc. (“REV” or “the Company”) and all its subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise noted) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended October 31, 2022. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
Equity Sponsor : The Company’s primary equity holders are funds and an investment vehicle associated with AIP CF IV, LLC, which the Company collectively refers to as “American Industrial Partners,” “AIP” or “Sponsor” and which indirectly own approximately
46.3 % of REV Group’s voting equity as of January 31, 2023. AIP is an operations and engineering-focused private equity firm headquartered in New York, New York.
Related Party Transactions : During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company reimbursed expenses of its primary equity holder of $ 0.2
million and $ 0.1
million, respectively. These expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncement Recently Adopted   In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”. The standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 such as recognizing deferred taxes for equity investments, the incremental approach to performing intra-period tax allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The standard also simplifies accounting for income taxes under U.S. GAAP by clarifying and amending existing guidance, including the recognition of deferred taxes for goodwill, the allocation of taxes to members of a consolidated group and requiring that an entity reflect the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The Company
adopted
ASU 2019-12 as of
November 1, 2021 . The adoption did
no t have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note 2. Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized from contracts with customers with product shipment destinations in the United States and Canada. The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company determines the transaction price for each contract at inception based on the consideration that it expects to receive for the goods and services promised under the contract. The transaction price excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and certain “pass-through” amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company has elected to expense incremental costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period of the related asset is expected to be less than one year. 7
The Company’s primary source of revenue is generated from the manufacture and sale of specialty vehicles through its direct sales force or dealer network. The Company also generates revenue through separate contracts that relate to the sale of aftermarket parts and services. Revenue is typically recognized at a point-in-time, when control is transferred, which generally occurs when the product has been shipped to the customer or when it has been picked-up from the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Shipping and handling costs that occur after the transfer of control are fulfillment costs that are recorded in “Cost of Sales” in the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss when incurred or when the related product revenue is recognized, whichever is earlier. Periodically, certain customers may request bill and hold transactions according to the terms in the contract. In such cases, revenue is not recognized until after control has transferred which is generally when the customer has requested such transaction and has been notified that the product (i) has been completed according to customer specifications, (ii) has passed our quality control inspections, and (iii) has been separated from our inventory, is ready for physical transfer to the customer, and when the Company cannot use the product or redirect the product to another customer. Warranty obligations associated with the sale of a unit are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the unit’s intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities The Company is generally entitled to bill its customers upon satisfaction of its performance obligations, and payment is usually received shortly after billing. Payments for certain contracts are received in advance of satisfying the related performance obligations. Such payments are recorded as "customer advances" in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reduces the contract liabilities when the Company transfers control of the promised good or service. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 37.6
million and $ 31.1
million, respectively, of revenue that was included in the customer advance balances of $ 332.8
million and $ 210.6
million as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. The Company’s payment terms do not include a significant financing component outside of the F&E segment. Within the F&E segment, customers earn interest on customer advances at a rate determined at contract inception. Interest charges incurred on customer advances during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 of $ 1.9
million and $ 1.5
million, respectively, were recorded in "interest expense" in the Condensed Unaudited Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company does not have significant contract assets. Remaining Performance Obligations As of January 31, 2023, the Company had unsatisfied performance obligations for non-cancellable contracts with an original duration greater than one year totaling $ 2,459.4
million, of which $ 1,475.1
million is expected to be satisfied and recognized in revenue in the next
twelve months
and $ 984.3
million is expected to be satisfied and recognized in revenue
thereafter .
Note 3. Leases The Company leases certain administrative and production facilities and equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a ROU asset and a lease liability based on the present value of fixed, and certain index-based lease payments at the lease commencement date. Variable payments are excluded from the present value of lease payments and are recognized in the period in which the payment is made. Lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease or purchase the underlying asset. In situations where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options, they are considered in determining the lease term and the associated option payments, or exercise price in the case of an option to purchase, are included in the measurement of the lease liabilities and ROU assets. The Company’s leases generally do not include restrictive financial or other covenants, or residual value guarantees. The Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for measuring its lease liabilities, as the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because it does not have access to certain lessor specific information. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not have significant finance leases.
8
During the three months ended January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, the Company recognized total operating lease costs of $ 2.2
million and $ 2.0
million, respectively, and paid cash of $ 2.5
million and $ 2.3
million, respectively, for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities.
At January 31, 2023, future fixed minimum operating lease payments are summarized in the table below:

Note 7. Divestiture Activities
The Company previously made an initial investment in its China joint venture, Anhui Chery REV Specialty Vehicle Technology Co., Ltd (“China JV”), in exchange for
10 % equity interest. The Company recorded this investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s investment in the China JV also included an interest-bearing loan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company made the strategic decision to exit its interests in the China JV and began soliciting offers to sell the investment and settle the loan. In connection with this decision, the Company recorded a loss of $ 6.2
million during the year ended October 31, 2021, which represented the difference between the carrying value of the investment and loan and the estimated proceeds to be received upon sale and settlement, respectively.
Subsequently, the Company sold its equity interest and recorded an additional loss of $ 0.2
million, which has been recorded as a non-operating loss within our Condensed Unaudited Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended January 31, 2023. In connection with the sale, the Company received a total of $ 2.4
million, of which $ 0.6
million was received during the three months ended January 31, 2023, which has been included within the Other investing activities section of the Condensed Unaudited Statements of Cash Flows.
Note 8. Restructuring and Other Related Charges
In September 2021, the Company announced that it would close its Kovatch Mobile Equipment (“KME”) production facilities located in Nesquehoning, PA and Roanoke, VA and relocate the production to other existing F&E segment facilities within the United States.
The Company incurred certain restructuring and other related charges in connection with the decision to relocate its existing KME production facilities. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company did
no t incur any restructuring charges, but did incur $ 2.4
million of other charges consisting of production inefficiencies. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $ 3.7
million and additional charges of $ 2.1
million consisting of $ 1.4
million of accelerated depreciation and $ 0.7
million of other costs.

As of October 31, 2022, this restructuring activity was substantially complete and any remaining liability is immaterial as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
Note 9. Long-Term Debt The Company was obligated under the following debt instrument:
January 31,
2023
October 31, 2022
ABL facility
$
250.0
$
230.0
ABL Facility On April 13, 2021, the Company entered into a $ 550.0
million revolving credit agreement (the “ABL Facility” or “ABL Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The ABL Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $ 550.0
million. The total credit facility is subject to a $ 30.0
million sublimit for swing line loans and a $ 35.0
million sublimit for letters of credit (plus up to an additional $ 20.0
million of letters of credit at issuing bank’s discretion), along with certain borrowing base and other customary restrictions as defined in the ABL Agreement. The ABL Agreement allows for incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $ 100.0
million, plus the excess, if any, of the borrowing base then in effect over total commitments then in effect. Any such incremental facilities are subject to receiving additional commitments from lenders and certain other customary conditions. The debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with the ABL Facility less accumulated amortization are included in other long-term assets in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.   On November 1, 2022, the Company amended the ABL Facility to transition from the Eurodollar based benchmark rates to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR").
The transition from the Eurodollar rate to SOFR did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.   The ABL Facility matures on
April 13, 2026 . The Company may prepay the principal, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty.   All revolving loans under the ABL Facility, as amended, bear interest at rates equal to, at the Company’s option, either a base rate plus an applicable margin, or a SOFR rate plus an applicable margin and credit spread adjustment of
0.10 % for all interest periods. As of January 31, 2023, the interest rate margins are
1.0 % for all base rate loans and
2.0 % for all SOFR rate loans (with the
SOFR rate having a floor of
0.0 %), subject to adjustment based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio in accordance with the ABL Agreement. Interest is payable quarterly for all base rate loans and is payable the last day of any interest period or every three months for all SOFR rate loans. The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility was
6.47 % as of January 31, 2023. The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility was
5.51 % as of October 31, 2022.
The lenders under the ABL Facility have a first priority security interest in substantially all personal property assets and certain real property assets of the Company. The ABL Facility’s borrowing base is comprised of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, plus a fixed asset sublimit of certain eligible real property and eligible equipment, which fixed asset sublimit reduces by quarterly amortization as specified in the ABL Agreement.   The ABL Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, subject in certain cases to customary limitations, exceptions and exclusions. The ABL Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default under the ABL Agreement could result in the termination of the commitments under the ABL Facility and the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings under it. The Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of
1.10
to
1.00
during certain compliance periods as specified in the ABL Agreement.
The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the ABL Agreement as of January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility was $ 285.5
million. As of October 31, 2022, the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility was $ 307.7
million. The fair value of the ABL Facility approximated the book value on January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.

Note 10. Warranties The Company’s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from several months to several years, based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace. Selected components (such as engines, transmissions, tires, etc.) included in the Company’s end products may include warranties from original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”). These OEM warranties are passed on to the end customer of the Company’s products, and the customer deals directly with the applicable OEM for any issues encountered on those components. Changes in the Company’s warranty liability consisted of the following:

Note 11. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income, if applicable, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The difference between basic EPS and diluted EPS is the result of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, performance stock units and restricted stock units and awards.
The reconciliation of basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding was as follows:

Note 12. Income Taxes For interim financial reporting, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate based on the projected income for its entire fiscal year and records a provision (benefit) for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on the estimated annual effective income tax rate, adjusted for any discrete tax items. 12
The Company recorded income tax benefit of $ 5.1
million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, or
27.4 % of pre-tax loss, compared to $ 1.8
million of benefit, or
72.0 % of pre-tax loss, for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Results for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 were favorably impacted by $ 0.6
million and $ 1.2
million, respectively, of net discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation tax deductions.
The Company periodically evaluates its valuation allowance requirements as facts and circumstances change and may adjust its deferred tax asset valuation allowances accordingly. It is reasonably possible that the Company will either add to or reverse a portion of its existing deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future. Such changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances will be reflected in the current operations through the Company’s effective income tax rate.
The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $ 4.4
million as of January 31, 2023 and $ 4.3
million as of October 31, 2022. The unrecognized tax benefits are presented in other long-term liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets for the period ended January 31, 2023. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in its Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. As of January 31, 2023, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax positions it has taken will be sustained upon the resolution of its audits resulting in no material impact on its consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows. However, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from the Company’s estimates and/or from its historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities and could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments related to income tax examinations.
Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is, from time to time, party to various legal proceedings, including product and general liability claims, arising out of ordinary course of business. Many legal proceedings involve highly complex issues which are subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of legal proceedings can involve complex judgments about future events that may rely on estimates and assumptions. When assessing whether to record a liability related to legal proceedings, the Company adheres to the requirements of ASC 450,
Contingencies , and other applicable guidance as necessary, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. When a range exists that is reasonably estimable and the loss is probable, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range, if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may be incurred. Additionally, these claims are generally covered by third-party insurance, which for some insurance policies is subject to a retention for which the Company is responsible.
Market Risks :
The Company is contingently liable under bid, performance and specialty bonds and has open standby letters of credit issued by the Company’s banks in favor of third parties as follows:

Chassis Contingent Liabilities : The Company obtains certain vehicle chassis from automobile manufacturers under converter pool agreements. These agreements generally provide that the manufacturer will supply chassis at the Company’s various production facilities under the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. The manufacturer does not transfer the certificate of origin to the Company upon delivery. Accordingly, the chassis are not owned by the Company when delivered, and therefore, are excluded from the Company’s inventory. Upon being put into production, the Company owns the inventory and becomes obligated to pay the manufacturer for the chassis. Chassis are typically placed into production within 90 to 120 days of delivery to the Company. If the chassis are not placed into production within this timeframe, the Company generally purchases the chassis and records inventory, or the Company is obligated to begin paying an interest charge on this inventory until purchased. Such agreements are customary in the industries in which the Company operates and the Company’s exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the value of the vehicle chassis that would be resold to mitigate any losses. The Company’s contingent liability under such agreements was $ 21.3
million and $ 11.9
million as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. 13
Repurchase Commitments : The Company has repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions. The repurchase commitments are on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer or other customer, generally not exceeding
two years . The Company also repurchases inventory from dealers from time to time due to state law or regulatory requirements that require manufacturers to repurchase inventory if a dealership exits the business. The Company’s maximum contingent liability under such agreements was $ 363.8
million and $ 333.8
million as of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively, which represents the gross value of all vehicles under repurchase agreements. Such agreements are customary in the industries in which the Company operates and the Company’s exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the units which are required to be repurchased. Losses incurred under such arrangements have not been significant. The reserve for losses included in other liabilities on contracts outstanding as of
January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 are immaterial. Guarantee Arrangements : The Company is party to multiple agreements whereby it guarantees indebtedness of others, including losses under loss pool agreements. The Company estimated that its maximum loss exposure under these contracts was $ 7.3
million and $ 8.7
million at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. Under the terms of these and various related agreements and upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company generally has the ability to, among other things, take possession of the underlying collateral. While the Company does not expect to experience losses under these agreements that are materially in excess of the amounts reserved, it cannot provide any assurance that the financial condition of the third parties will not deteriorate resulting in the third party’s inability to meet their obligations. Additionally, the Company cannot guarantee that the collateral underlying the agreements will be available or sufficient to avoid losses materially in excess of the amount reserved.
Other Matters : Krystal Bus:
In January 2023, the Company agreed, in principle, to settle a claim brought by a plaintiff who was injured as a passenger in an accident involving a shuttle bus that was manufactured by Krystal Bus prior to the Company’s acquisition of certain assets related to that business. The Company did not admit to any liability on the merits of the claim, but deemed a settlement to be in its best interest based on the facts and circumstances of the claim, as they developed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The settlement agreement provides for a one-time cash payment of $ 11.5
million, which is expected to be disbursed by the Company in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. The Company is also involved in additional lawsuits filed by plaintiffs who were passengers on the shuttle bus that was in the same accident. No settlements have been reached with respect to these claims; however, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 the Company recorded a loss of $ 1.0
million, based on a range of possible outcomes and the nature of their injuries. The losses associated with these claims are included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended January 31, 2023, and the related liability is included in other current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Unaudited Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2023. The Company is in the process of seeking potential reimbursement of the settlement payment and for any potential future settlements or losses related to the other claims from the Company’s insurers; however, the relevant insurers have so far disputed the insurance claims. Accordingly, no loss recovery asset has been recorded as of January 31, 2023.
Securities Case:
A consolidated federal putative securities class action and a consolidated state putative securities class action against the Company and certain of its officers and directors was settled during fiscal year 2022. These actions collectively purported to assert claims on behalf of putative classes of purchasers of the Company’s common stock in or traceable to its January 2017 IPO, purchasers in its secondary offering of common stock in October 2017, and purchasers from October 10, 2017 through June 7, 2018. The actions alleged certain violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and, for the federal action, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Collectively, the actions sought certification of the putative classes asserted and compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 19, 2021, the parties to the consolidated federal and state putative securities class actions executed a stipulation of settlement for a class settlement with the court and moved for preliminary approval. The settlement payment is being fully covered by the Company's insurers. The court entered a judgment approving the settlement on December 9, 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company’s insurers made the final settlement payment. As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023, there are no further amounts recorded in the Condensed Unaudited Balance Sheets. Two purported derivative actions, which have since been consolidated, were also filed in 2019 against the Company’s directors (with the Company as a nominal defendant), premised on allegations similar to those asserted in the consolidated federal securities litigation. The parties to the consolidated derivative actions reached a settlement in principle on all issues on or about November 3, 2021. The plaintiffs filed a stipulation of settlement for the derivative actions with the court and moved for preliminary approval of the settlement on January 14, 2022. The court granted final approvement of the settlement on November 17, 2022. The settlement payment is being fully covered by the Company’s insurers.

Note 14. Business Segment Information The Company is organized into
three
reportable segments based on management’s process for making operating decisions, allocating capital and measuring performance, and based on the similarity of products, customers served, common use of facilities, and economic characteristics. The Company’s segments are as follows: Fire & Emergency : This segment includes Emergency One (“E-ONE”), KME, Ferrara, Spartan Emergency Response (“Spartan ER”), American Emergency Vehicles, Leader Emergency Vehicles, Horton Emergency Vehicles and REV Group Orlando. These business units manufacture, market and distribute commercial and custom fire and emergency vehicles primarily for fire departments, airports, other governmental units, contractors, hospitals and other care providers in the United States and other countries. Commercial : This segment includes Collins Bus, ENC, Capacity and LayMor. Collins Bus manufactures, markets and distributes school buses, normally referred to as Type A school buses. ENC manufactures, markets and distributes municipal transit buses, primarily used for public transportation. Capacity manufactures, markets and distributes trucks used in terminal type operations, i.e., rail yards, warehouses, rail terminals and shipping terminals/ports. LayMor manufactures, markets and distributes industrial sweepers for both the commercial and rental markets. Recreation : This segment includes REV Recreation Group (“RRG”), Renegade, Midwest, Lance and Goldshield Fiberglass, Inc. (“Goldshield”), and their respective manufacturing facilities, service and parts divisions. RRG primarily manufactures, markets and distributes Class A RVs in both gas and diesel models. Renegade primarily manufactures, markets and distributes Class C and “Super C” RVs. Midwest manufactures, markets and distributes Class B RVs and luxury vans. Lance manufactures, markets and distributes truck campers and towable campers. Goldshield manufactures, markets and distributes fiberglass reinforced molded parts to a diverse cross section of original equipment manufacturers and other commercial and industrial customers, including various components for RRG, which is one of Goldshield’s primary customers. For purposes of measuring financial performance of its business segments, the Company does not allocate to individual business segments costs or items that are of a corporate nature. The caption “Corporate, Other & Elims” includes corporate office expenses, results of insignificant operations, intersegment eliminations and income and expense not allocated to reportable segments. Total assets of the business segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, certain property, plant and equipment and certain other assets pertaining to corporate and other centralized activities. Intersegment sales generally include amounts invoiced by a segment for work performed for another segment. Amounts are based on actual work performed and agreed-upon pricing which is intended to be reflective of the contribution made by the supplying business segment. All intersegment transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In considering the financial performance of the business, the chief operating decision maker analyzes the primary financial performance measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes and loss on early extinguishment of debt, as applicable, as adjusted for items management believes are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined by U.S. GAAP but is computed using amounts that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of this performance measure to net loss is included below. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and used by management for measuring profitability because the measure excludes the impact of certain items which management believes have less bearing on the Company’s core operating performance, and allows for a more meaningful comparison of operating fundamentals between companies within its industries by eliminating the impact of capital structure and taxation differences between the companies. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure and report the Company’s financial performance to the Company’s Board of Directors, assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the Company’s operating performance and is used as a measurement in incentive compensation for management.

Note 15. Stock Repurchase Program During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company did
no t repurchase any shares under the 2021 repurchase program noted below. On September 2, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new share repurchase program that allowed the repurchase of up to $ 150.0
million of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The share repurchase authorization expires in 24 months and gives management the flexibility to determine conditions under which shares may be purchased. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and retired
1,980,159
shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of $ 24.4
million and at an average price, excluding commissions, of $ 12.29
per share.
Note 16. Subsequent Events Quarterly Dividend On February 23, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $ 0.05
per share of common stock, which equates to a rate of $ 0.20
per share of common stock on an annualized basis, payable on
April 14, 2023
to shareholders of record on
March 31, 2023 .

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and risk factors contained in this Form 10-Q as well as the Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors and audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on December 14, 2022.
Overview
REV Group companies are leading designers, manufacturers and distributors of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. We serve a diversified customer base, primarily in the United States, through three segments: Fire and Emergency (“F&E”), Commercial, and Recreation. We provide customized vehicle solutions for applications, including essential needs for public services (ambulances, fire apparatus, school buses, and transit buses), commercial infrastructure (terminal trucks and industrial sweepers) and consumer leisure (recreational vehicles). Our diverse portfolio is made up of well-established principal vehicle brands, including many of the most recognizable names within their industry. Several of our brands pioneered their specialty vehicle product categories and date back more than 50 years. We believe that we hold the first, second and third market share positions, and approximately 91% of our net sales during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 came from products where we believe we hold such share position.
Segments
We serve a diversified customer base primarily in the United States and Canada through the following segments:
Fire & Emergency
– The Fire & Emergency segment sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One (“E-ONE”), Kovatch Mobile Equipment (“KME”), Ferrara, and Spartan Emergency Response (“Spartan ER”) which consists of Spartan Emergency Response, Smeal, Spartan Fire Chassis, and Ladder Tower brands, and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles (“AEV”), Horton Emergency Vehicles (“Horton”), Leader Emergency Vehicles (“Leader”), Road Rescue and Wheeled Coach brands. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States and have one of the industry’s broadest portfolios of products including Type I ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a heavy truck-style chassis), Type II ambulances (van conversion ambulance), Type III ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a van-style chassis), pumpers (fire apparatus on a custom or commercial chassis with a water pump and water tank to extinguish fires), ladder trucks (fire apparatus with stainless steel or aluminum ladders), tanker trucks and rescue, aircraft rescue firefighting (“ARFF”), custom cabs & chassis and other vehicles. Each of our individual brands is distinctly positioned and targets certain price and feature points in the market such that dealers often carry, and customers often buy more than one REV Fire & Emergency product line.
Commercial
– Our Commercial segment serves the bus market through the Collins Bus, Magellan and ENC brands. We serve the terminal truck market through the Capacity brand and the sweeper market through the LayMor brand. Our products in the Commercial segment include transit buses (large municipal buses where we build our own chassis and body), Type A school buses (small school bus built on commercial chassis), sweepers (three- and four-wheel versions used in road construction activities), and terminal trucks (specialized vehicles which move freight in warehouses, intermodal yards, distribution and fulfillment centers and ports). Within each market, we produce many customized configurations to address the diverse needs of our customers.
Recreation
– Our Recreation segment serves the RV market through the following principal brands: American Coach, Fleetwood RV, Holiday Rambler, Renegade RV, Midwest Automotive Designs and Lance. We believe our brand portfolio contains some of the longest standing, most recognized brands in the RV industry. Under these brands, REV provides a variety of highly recognized motorized and towable RV models such as: American Eagle, Bounder, Pace Arrow, Discovery LXE, Renegade Verona, and Renegade XL, among others. Our products in the Recreation segment include Class A motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a heavy-duty chassis with either diesel or gas engine configurations), Class C and “Super C” motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a commercial truck or van chassis), Class B RVs (motorhomes built out within a van chassis and high-end luxury van conversions), and towable travel trailers and truck campers. The Recreation segment also includes Goldshield Fiberglass, which produces a wide range of custom molded fiberglass products for the heavy-duty truck, RV and broader industrial markets.

Factors Affecting Our Performance
The primary factors affecting our results of operations include:
General Economic Conditions
Our business is impacted by the U.S. economic environment, inflationary pressures, employment levels, consumer confidence, municipal spending, municipal tax receipts, changes in interest rates and instability in securities markets around the world, among other factors. In particular, changes in the U.S. economic climate can impact demand in key end markets. In addition, we are susceptible to supply chain disruptions resulting from the impact of tariffs and global macro-economic factors (refer to “Impact of COVID-19” section below), which can have a dramatic effect, either directly or indirectly, on the availability, lead-times and costs associated with raw materials and parts.
RV purchases are discretionary in nature and therefore sensitive to the availability of financing, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, levels of disposable income and changing levels of consumer home equity, among other factors. RV markets are affected by general U.S. and global economic conditions, which create risks that future economic downturns will further reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our sales.
While less economically sensitive than the Recreation segment, the Fire & Emergency segment and the Commercial segment are also impacted by the overall economic environment. Local tax revenues are an important source of funding for fire and emergency response departments. Fire and emergency products and buses are typically a larger cost item for municipalities and their service life is relatively long, making the purchase more deferrable, which can result in reduced demand for our products. In addition to commercial demand, local, state and federal tax revenues can be an important source of funding for many of our bus products including Type A school buses and transit buses. Volatility in tax revenues or availability of funds via budgetary appropriation can have a negative impact on the demand for these products.
A decrease in employment levels, consumer confidence or the availability of financing, or other adverse economic events, or the failure of actual demand for our products to meet our estimates, could negatively affect the demand for our products. Any decline in overall customer demand in markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.
Seasonality
In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, the slowest sales volume quarter has been the first fiscal quarter when the purchasing seasons for vehicles, such as school buses, RVs and sweepers are the lowest due to the colder weather and the relatively long time until the summer vacation season, and the fact that the school year is underway with municipalities and school bus contractors utilizing their existing fleets to transport student populations. Sales of our products have typically been higher in the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters (with the fourth fiscal quarter typically being the strongest) due to better weather, the vacation season, buying habits of RV dealers and end-users, timing of government/municipal customer fiscal years, and the beginning of a new school year. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity are likely to be impacted by these seasonal patterns. Sales and earnings for other vehicles that we produce, such as essential emergency vehicles and commercial bus fleets, are less seasonal, but fluctuations in sales of these vehicles can also be impacted by timing surrounding the fiscal years of municipalities and commercial customers, as well as the timing and amounts of multi-unit orders. We are also impacted by the change in production days in a given quarter. Historically, our first fiscal quarter includes the lowest number of production days.
Impact of Acquisitions
We actively evaluate opportunities to improve and expand our business through targeted acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy. We also may dispose of certain components of our business that no longer fit within our overall strategy. Historically, a significant component of our growth has been through acquisitions of businesses. We typically incur upfront costs as we integrate acquired businesses and implement our operating philosophy at newly acquired companies, including consolidation of supplies and materials, purchases, improvements to production processes, and other restructuring initiatives. The benefits of these integration efforts and divestiture activities may not positively impact our financial results until subsequent periods.
We recognize acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. This includes the recognition of identified intangible assets and goodwill which, in the case of definite-life intangible assets, are then amortized over their expected useful lives, which typically results in an increase in amortization expense. In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible assets as well as contingent assets and liabilities.
18
Impact of COVID-19
During our second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the novel coronavirus known as "COVID-19" spread throughout the world creating a global pandemic. The pandemic triggered a significant downturn in global commerce and these challenging market conditions may continue for an extended period of time. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, we have also experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain, customer demand changes, and logistics challenges, including our customers’ ability to inspect and take delivery of vehicles.
Our Recreation vehicles dealer network was significantly impacted by the pandemic and many of them closed temporarily before reopening in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 when consumer demand for recreation vehicles began to accelerate due to an increase in consumer preference to vacation in a safe and socially distant manner.
As the global economy continues to recover from COVID-19 related disruption, labor and significant supply chain challenges, such as shortages in semiconductors, subcomponents and increased prices of raw materials, such as steel and aluminum, have impacted operations of companies on a global scale. Such supply chain disruptions during the fiscal year 2022 impacted our ability to obtain certain raw materials and purchased components that are necessary to our production processes, including the ability to obtain chassis from third party suppliers. We continue to monitor these disruptions and take measures to mitigate the associated risks.
In certain geographies there has been a resurgence of COVID-19 variant cases and governmental authorities continue to implement numerous measures in an attempt to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants. While the global market impacts, closures and limitations on movement are expected to be temporary, the duration of any demand changes, production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts, cannot be reliably estimated at this time.

Net Sales:
Consolidated net sales increased $46.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in net sales, including price realization, within the Commercial and Recreation segments, partially offset by a decrease in net sales within the Fire and Emergency (F&E segment). The increase in net sales in the Commercial segment was primarily due to higher shipments of school buses, terminal trucks and street sweepers, and price realization, partially offset by decreased shipments of municipal transit buses. The increase in net sales in the Recreation segment was primarily due to favorable mix and price realization, partially offset by lower shipments related to supply chain disruptions in certain businesses. The decrease in net sales in the F&E segment was primarily due to decreased shipments and unfavorable mix and production inefficiencies of fire apparatus, partially offset by a favorable mix of ambulance units, and price realization.

Each of our three segments has a backlog of new vehicle orders that generally extends out from six to twenty-four months in duration.
Orders from our dealers and end customers are evidenced by a contract or a firm purchase order. These orders are reported in our backlog at the aggregate selling prices, net of discounts or allowances. Backlog is comprised of orders that may be canceled, modified or otherwise changed in the future. As a result, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results.
22
As of January 31, 2023, our backlog was $4,160.1 million compared to $3,397.5 million as of January 31, 2022. The increase in consolidated backlog was primarily due to increases within the F&E and Commercial segments, partially offset by decreases within the Recreation segment. The increase in F&E segment backlog was primarily the result of increased orders for fire apparatus and ambulance units, pricing actions, and lower shipments against new order intake. The increase in Commercial segment backlog was primarily the result of increased orders for school buses, terminal trucks and municipal transit buses, and pricing actions. The decrease in Recreation segment backlog was primarily the result of an expected normalization of order intake in several product categories, partially offset by pricing actions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, the improvement and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, debt service payments and general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our ABL credit facility.
We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, including working capital requirements, dividends, share repurchases and growth strategy for at least twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the current ABL facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under the current ABL facility is not sufficient due to the size of our borrowing base or other external factors, we may have to obtain additional financing. If additional capital is obtained by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations or may involve higher overall interest rates.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $6.9 million and was primarily related to increase in inventories and the payment of deferred payroll taxes related to the CARES Act, partially offset by an increase in customer advances and payables. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $3.7 million and was primarily related to decreases from the timing of accounts receivable collections and inventory receipts as well as incentive compensation payments, partially offset by increases from the timing of payables payments and customer advances, and a tax refund related to the CARES Act received during the quarter.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $3.0 million and was related to the cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by cash received in connection with the sales of certain assets including the investment in the China JV. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $4.4 million and was related to the cash paid for capital expenditures.
23
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $12.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from our ABL Facility of $20.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $3.1 million, and payment of payroll taxes on vested awards of $4.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $8.7 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from our ABL Facility for $41.0 million offset by share repurchases of $24.4 million, dividends paid of $3.3 million and the payment of payroll taxes on vested awards and other financing activities of $4.6 million.
Dividends
Subject to legally available funds and the discretion of our board of directors, we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend at the rate of $0.05 per share on our common stock. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have sufficient funds to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. A quarterly cash dividend was declared in the amount of $.05 per share of common stock payable on April 14, 2023, to shareholders of record on March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we paid cash dividends of $3.1 million.
ABL Facility
On April 13, 2021, the Company entered into a $550.0 million revolving credit agreement (the “ABL Facility” or “ABL Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The ABL Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $550.0 million. The total credit facility is subject to a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans and a $35.0 million sublimit for letters of credit (plus up to an additional $20.0 million of letters of credit at issuing bank’s discretion), along with certain borrowing base and other customary restrictions as defined in the ABL Agreement. The ABL Agreement allows for incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million, plus the excess, if any, of the borrowing base then in effect over total commitments then in effect. Any such incremental facilities are subject to receiving additional commitments from lenders and certain other customary conditions.
The ABL Facility matures on April 13, 2026. We may prepay principal, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ABL Agreement as of January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility was $285.5 million.
Refer to Note 9, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income
In considering the financial performance of the business, management analyzes the primary financial performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net Income for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes and loss on early extinguishment of debt, as applicable, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful to investors because these performance measures are used by our management and our Board of Directors for measuring and reporting our financial performance and as a measurement in incentive compensation for management. These measures exclude the impact of certain items which we believe have less bearing on our core operating performance because they are items that are not needed or available to our managers in the daily activities of their businesses. We believe that the core operations of our business are those which can be affected by our management in a particular period through their resource allocation decisions that affect the underlying performance of our operations conducted during that period. We also believe that decisions utilizing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income allow for a more meaningful comparison of operating fundamentals between companies within our markets by eliminating the impact of capital structure and taxation differences between the companies.
24
To determine Adjusted EBITDA, we adjust Net Income for the following items: non-cash depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, loss on early extinguishment of debt as applicable and other items as described below. Stock-based compensation expense and sponsor expense reimbursement are excluded from both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA because it is an expense, which cannot be impacted by our business managers. Stock-based compensation expense also reflects a cost which may obscure trends in our underlying vehicle businesses for a given period, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards. We also adjust for exceptional items, which are determined to be those that in management’s judgment are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, and include non-cash items and items settled in cash. In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools. These are not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not measures of financial condition and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net loss for the period determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is Net Income for the relevant period. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, such measures do not reflect:
• our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
• changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
• the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
• the cash requirements to pay our taxes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures and capital resources. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our disclosures of critical accounting policies are reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we adopted ASU 2019-12 relating to Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures.
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures”, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
During the quarter ended January 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
