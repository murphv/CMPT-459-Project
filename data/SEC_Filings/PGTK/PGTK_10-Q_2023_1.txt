Restatement of Financial Statements
In June 2022, while preparing the financial
statements for the year-ending March 31, 2022, the Company identified errors in previously issued unaudited quarterly financial statements.
Refer to Note 2 and Note 22 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2022, for additional information regarding the impact of the restatement on the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations and certain note presentation.
- Revenue and cost of sales has been adjusted to record revenue
on marine scrubber contracts as a single performance obligation recognized over time.
- Cost of sales has been adjusted to include amortization of
certain intangible assets, commission amounts, salaries and wages, and technical consulting costs that had previously been included within
other expense captions in the financial statements.
The impact on the interim consolidated statement of cash flows has been reclassified within the operating activities for all periods presented.

(c) Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL) model which requires
the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience,
current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement
of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. As a smaller reporting
company, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and management does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position
or results of operations.

(d) Correction
of Immaterial Error of Lease Accounting
In February 2023, during the preparation
of the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified an error in its accounting for a lease for
land. The Company executed a 15-year lease on June 16, 2022 and the Company accounted for this incorrectly in Q1 and Q2 by expensing the
rental cash payments. The Company should have applied the provisions of ASC 842 – Accounting for Leases. The Company has also considered
the qualitative effects this error may have had. It has concluded that the error is deemed to be not material to the Q1 and Q2 financial
statements. The net effects on the income statement, balance sheet and cashflow statement for the two interim quarters ending June 30,
2022 and September 30, 2022 are shown in the table below.

The Company has analyzed its
sales contracts under ASC 606 and has identified that the percentage of completion of the contract often is not directly correlated with
contractual billing terms with customers. As a result of the timing differences between customer
sales invoices and percentage of completion of the contract, contractual assets and contractual liabilities have been recognized.

As of December 31, 2022, Contract liabilities
included $ 8,038,674
(March 31, 2022 - $ 8,098,009 ) being aggregate cash receipts from one customer relating to thirteen vessels (March
31, 2022 – fourteen vessels). At March 31, 2021 all nineteen had been postponed under the terms of a Postponement Agreement dated
February 2, 2021, with an option to either proceed or cancel.
Under a subsequent Option Agreement
dated August 9, 2021, six of these vessels were contracted by the customer to proceed.
None
of the total contract liability at December
31, 2022 relates to these six vessels. The contract liability balance was mainly related to the other thirteen postponed vessels in the
Postponement Agreement, which was due to expire on
February 9, 2023 . However, in January 2023, the Postponement Agreement deadline was
extended to December 2023. Should the thirteen vessels that are currently postponed remain as such at the expiry date, since there is
no obligation to return the funds to the client, the contract liability would be recognized as revenue in full at that point in time.

The Company determined the discount rate with reference to mortgages of similar tenure and terms.
Operating lease assets and operating
lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement
date. As the Company’s operating lease does not provide an implicit rate, the discount rate used to determine the present value
of the lease payments is the collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease term. The operating lease asset excludes
lease incentives. The operating leases do not contain an option to extend or terminate the lease term at the Company’s discretion,
therefore no probable renewal has been added to the expiry date when determining lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease cost for the three and nine months
are summarized as follows:

17. Income
Taxes
(continued)
At December 31, 2022, the Company is
current with statutory corporate income tax filings. Certain of the amounts presented above are based on estimates and what management
believes are prudent filing positions. The actual losses available could differ from these estimates upon assessment and review by taxation
authorities. U.S. federal and state income tax returns filed by us remain subject to examination for income tax years 2013 and subsequent.
Canadian federal and provincial income tax returns filed by us remain subject to examination for income tax years
2018 and subsequent. Income tax returns associated with our operations located in the United Kingdom and China are subject to examination
for income tax years 2017 and subsequent.
Tax positions are evaluated for recognition
using a more-likely than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50 % likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
The Company estimates that it has accumulated estimated net operating
losses of approximately $ 28.4
million which were incurred mainly in the U.S, and which don’t begin to expire until
2033 .  In
addition, the Company estimates that it has approximately $ 4.8
million in losses available in the United Kingdom. Historical losses in
the U.S., are subject to limitations on use due to deemed changes in control for tax purposes. This impacts the timing and opportunity
to use certain losses.

Corporate History
Our company was incorporated in Delaware on March
10, 1994, under the name of Beta Acquisition Corp. In September 1995, we changed our name to In-Sports International, Inc. In August 2002,
we changed our name from In-Sports International, Inc. to ECash, Inc. In 2007, due to limited financial resources, we discontinued our
operations. Over the course of the ensuing five years, we sought out new business opportunities.
On June 13, 2012, we changed our name to Pacific
Green Technologies Inc. and effected a reverse split of our common stock following which we had 27,002 shares of common stock outstanding
with $0.001 par value.
2
Effective December 4, 2012, we filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation, wherein we increased our authorized share capital
to 510,000,000 shares of stock as follows:
●
500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001; and
●
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001.
The increase of authorized capital was approved
by our board of directors on July 1, 2012 and by a majority of our stockholders by a resolution dated July 1, 2012.
Original Strategy and Recent Business
Since 2012, the Company has focused on marketing,
developing and acquiring technologies designed to improve the environment by reducing pollution. The Company has acquired technologies,
patents and intellectual property from EnviroTechnologies Inc. through share transfer, assignment and representation agreements entered
into during 2012 and 2013. Following those acquisitions, management has expanded the registration of intellectual property rights around
the world and pursued opportunities globally for the development and marketing of the emission control technologies.
Working with a worldwide network of agents to
market the ENVI-Systems™ emission control technologies, the Company has focused on three applications of the technology:
ENVI-Marine  TM
Diesel exhaust from ships, ferries and tankers
includes ash and soot as particulate components and sulfur dioxide as an acid gas. Testing has been conducted on diesel shipping to confirm
the application of seawater as a neutralizing agent for sulfur emissions as well as capturing particulate matter. In addition to marine
applications, these tests also showed applicability of the system for large displacement engines such as stationary generators, compressors,
container handling, heavy construction and mining equipment.
ENVI-Pure  TM
Increasing legislation relating to landfill of
municipal solid waste has led to the emergence of increasing numbers of waste to energy plants (“ WtE ”). A WtE plant
obviates the need for landfill, burning municipal waste for conversion to electricity. A WtE plant is typically 45-100MW. The ENVI-Clean™
system is particularly suited to WtE as it cleans multiple pollutants in a single system.
ENVI-Clean  TM
EnviroTechnologies Inc. has successfully conducted
sulfur dioxide demonstration tests at the American Bituminous Coal Partners power plant in Grant Town, West Virginia. The testing achieved
a three test average of 99.3% removal efficiency. The implementation of US Clean Air regulations in July 2010 has created additional demand
for sulfur dioxide removal in all industries emitting sulfur pollution. Furthermore, China consumes approximately one half of the world’s
coal, but introduced measures designed to reduce energy and carbon intensity in its 12th Five Year Plan. Applications include regional
power facilities and heating for commercial buildings and greenhouses. Typical applications range in size from 1 to 20 megawatts (MW)
with power generation occupying the larger end of the range. The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulfur dioxide, particulate
matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal
solid waste, diesel and other fuels.

Vision & Strategy
Pacific Green envisions a world of rapidly growing
demand for renewable energy technological solutions to address the challenges presented by a changing climate. Having achieved success
in marine emission control technologies we have now diversified our business to provide turnkey and scalable end-to-end environmental
and renewable technology solutions in the energy sector. Our technological platform now has three main divisions:
●
Emission Control Systems (“ECS”);
●
Concentrated Solar Power (“CSP”); and
●
Battery Energy Storage Systems (“BESS”);
In all the above areas, Pacific Green plans to
execute this vision by a dual strategy of equipment sales and proactive infrastructure development and ownership, each is led by acquisitions
of technology capabilities and project investment opportunities, highlighted to date by the following events:
●
on December 20, 2019, the Company closed the acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd. (“Engin”) a solar design, development and engineering company. Engin is a design and engineering business focused primarily on CSP, desalination and waste to energy technologies. Engin’s CSP reference plants in China comprise over 150MW and we are now in talks to provide CSP alongside future ammonia and hydrogen production facilities in Asia and South America;
●
on October 20, 2020, the Company closed the acquisition of Innoergy Limited (“Innoergy”), a UK based designer of BESS whose clients included Osaka Gas Co. Ltd, in Japan, and Limejump Limited in the UK, a subsidiary of Shell plc. The acquisition underpins our entry into the BESS market; and
●
on March 18, 2021, the Company acquired Richborough Energy Park Limited (“Richborough”), a BESS development project to deliver 100MW of energy in Kent, UK.
●
on December 6, 2022, the Company acquired Sheaf Energy Limited (“Sheaf”), a BESS development project to deliver 250MW of energy in Kent, UK.
In support of this dual strategy, we have adopted
a Human Resource Strategy that seeks to hire the best talent in the core areas of our business. Our hiring plan includes the addition
of sales and project execution specialists.
Strategic Partnerships
Pacific Green has forged global partnerships with
private and state-owned energy providers and owners. This strategic alignment with leading energy industry platforms empowers Pacific
Green to provide quickly scalable solutions in the core areas of our business, to gather unique insights on cutting-edge trends and leverage
recurring revenue opportunities that enable us to cross-sell products and services.

Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, and
2021.
Revenue for the three and nine Months Ended December
31, 2022 was $ 3,639,992 and $ 6,859,221 versus $5,252,807 and $6,714,594 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s
revenues were mainly derived from the sale of marine scrubber units and related services. During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company was in the process of commissioning 3 (2021 – 6) marine scrubber units which contributed to revenue of $2,253,221 (2021
– $3,710,227). In February 2021, a major client deferred 32 marine scrubber units. Of these, 6 units have proceeded (2 commissioned
in year ended March 31, 2022 and 4 commissioned in quarter ended June 30, 2022), while 13 were cancelled. The remainder are still postponed
and the option to either proceed or cancel, which originally expired on February 9, 2023, has been extended to December 2023. During the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, revenue from services, including specific services performed in the marine business sector
and design and engineering services in the solar business sector, was $1,386,771 and $2,251,553 as compared to $1,542,580 and $2,262,076
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
the gross profit margin for products and services were 20% (2021- 44%) and 38% (2021- 24%), respectively. The gross profit margin for
products decreased in 2022 because of lower contract value and consistent cost of goods sold for marine scrubbers delivered in 2022. Overall,
the gross profit margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 26% (2021 – 38%).
Expenses for the three and nine months ended December
31, 2022, were $2,665,734 and $9,054,688 as compared to $3,752,629 and $11,025,916 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.
Management and technical consulting fees were comprised of fees paid to our directors, officers and advisors for business development
efforts and advisory services. Office-based costs, travel expenses, and professional fees also increased due to increased business activities.
Additionally, the delivery of units resulted in warranty provision being recorded for possible maintenance and claim issues within a prescribed
period. For the three and nine month periods, the Company recorded a warranty recovery of $744,918 (2021 – expense of $18,159) and
$563,318 (2021 – $21,648) as a result of 1 (2021 – nil) and 5 (2021 – 2) vessels being commissioned and commencing their
warranty period. Included in this was a large release of the warranty provision, for vessels whose warranty period has expired.

we used $6,094,070 in operating activities, whereas we used $13,262,030 from operating activities for the three months period ended December
31, 2021. The operating cash flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, was mainly due to the collection of large receivables.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
we used $31,902,457 in investing activities, whereas we used $398,507 in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31,
2021. Our investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, were primarily related to additions of project under development
and equipment.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
we received $34,947,926 in financing activities, whereas we used $99,504 in financing activities for the nine months ended December 31,
2021. Our financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, were related to cash contribution from noncontrolling interest
and loan facilities.
Anticipated Cash Requirements
We have raised funds to construct our first BESS
99.98MW facility project at Richborough Energy Park in Kent, United Kingdom. On May 11, 2022 the Company announced it had entered into
a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement with a third party investor, who has committed $16 million (£13 million) of equity funds
to the project. On June 21, 2022 the Company announced it had reached financial close (“Financial Close”) for $34.90 million
(£28.25 million) of senior debt for the Richborough project. The senior debt, in conjunction with the equity investment, will provide
the Company with the funding to bring the battery park to commercial operations anticipated between June and September 2023. The senior
debt facility agreement is entered into with Close Leasing Limited (“CLL”), pursuant to which CLL will provide a development
loan to fund the construction, which will be utilized in stages following the expenditure of the equity investment. The development loan
will then be refinanced into a 10-year amortized term loan upon the start of commercial operations.
On December 6, 2022 the Company acquired Sheaf
Energy Limited for $9,126,000 (£7,500,000) which will be developed into our second BESS 250MW facility project. The acquisition
was funded with a secured loan from a third party investor, Sheaf Storage Limited. We anticipate reaching financial close during the first
half of 2023. We anticipate requiring additional short-term funds to fund our Sheaf project expenditure prior to financial close, plus
our normal operating expenditure over the next 12 months and are currently negotiating with several parties to raise sufficient funds
from private placements, shareholder loans and other third party loans.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,500,411 cash
on hand. After careful consideration we believe current operations, anticipated deliveries and expected profit from such deliveries, sales
of products in our Batteries business and the raising of short-term funds to be sufficient to cover expected cash operating expenses over
the next 12 months.
Our cash requirement estimates may change significantly
depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.
We currently have office locations in the United
States, Canada, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Australia. We have hired staff in various regions
and rely heavily upon the use of contractors and consultants. Our general and administrative expenses for the period will consist primarily
of technical consultants, management, salaries and wages, professional fees, transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and general
office expenses. The professional fees relate to matters such as contract review, business acquisitions, regulatory filings, patent maintenance,
and general legal, accounting and auditing fees.

Going Concern
Our financial statements for the quarter ended
December 31, 2022 have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The assessment of the liquidity and going concern
requires the Company to make judgments about the existence of conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. This includes judgments about
the Company’s future activities and the timing thereof and estimates of future cash flows. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s
forecasted model of liquidity include forecasted sales, costs, and capital expenditures. Changes in the assumptions could have a material
impact on the forecasted liquidity and going concern assessment.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our company bases its estimates and assumptions
on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from
our company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results
of operations will be affected. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most
critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties.
Useful lives of Intangible Assets
The carrying value of our intangible assets represents
its original cost at the time of purchase, less accumulated amortization. We amortize our intangible assets using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life of our intangible assets are listed in the table below.
Patents
17 years straight-line
Software licensing
10 years straight-line
8
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We review long-lived assets such as property and
equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.
The
determination of whether impairment indicators exist requires
significant judgment in evaluating underlying significant assumptions including expected sales contracts, operating costs, and current
market value of assets. If an indication is identified, and the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
We recorded an impairment charge of $2,641,639
on intangible assets during the year ended March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021- $37,700) as management’s estimated fair value of the
assets were less than its carrying value.
Goodwill
We allocate the cost of acquired companies to
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill. The
allocation of the purchase price of acquired companies requires certain judgments and estimates. Goodwill is not amortized but
is evaluated annually for impairment at the reporting unit level or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. The process
of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment and are based upon existing contracts, historical experience,
financial forecasts, and general economic conditions.
We recorded an impairment charge of $3,870,223
on Engin goodwill and $549,092 on Innoergy goodwill during the year ended March 31, 2022 as management’s estimated fair value of
the reporting unit was less than its carrying value determined during impairment testing.
Revenue Recognition
We derive revenue from the sale of products and
delivery of services. Irrespective of the types of revenue described above, revenue is recognized when control of products or services
is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
promised products or services. The majority of the Company’s marine scrubber sales contracts contain a single performance obligation
satisfied over time. Other contracts contain a single performance obligation satisfied at point in time.
Revenue recognition requires significant judgements
from management in regard to the determination of accounting treatment for contracts with customers. Management is required to assess
contracts with customers to identify whether performance obligations in the contract are distinct and to determine whether contract terms
provide the Company with a basis to recognize revenue over time.
According to ASC 606-10-25-27, if the entity’s
performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date, revenue should be recognized over time. The Company’s scrubber system is customized to each vessel at the detailed
design level, so the performance under the contract does not create an asset with an alternative use. According to the Company’s
contracts signed with customers under English law, the customers are contractually and legally obliged to pay for performance completed
to date that covers cost plus a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, the Company concluded that revenue should be recognized over time.
The Company recognizes revenue based on the input method using a percentage of costs to complete.
In the case of settlement agreements with customers
where no continued performance obligation is required, we recognize revenue based on consideration settled according to the agreement.
9
A contract signed with one customer has a significant
financing component. 20% of the contract price is payable at least 6 calendar months prior to the dry dock date. The remaining 80%
is payable in 24 equal monthly installments starting at the end of the calendar month following the installation date on a vessel-by-vessel
basis. As 80% of the contract price is payable after the last performance obligation towards the scrubber, a significant financing
component is separated from revenue and interest income at 5.4% is recorded when payments are received from the customer.
Contract Liabilities, Prepaid Manufacturing
Costs, and Accrued Revenue
We have analyzed our sales contracts under ASC
606 and identified performance conditions that are not directly correlated with contractual billing terms with customers. As a result
of the timing differences between customer sales invoices and satisfaction of performance conditions, contractual assets and contractual
liabilities have been recognized.
Contractual arrangements with customers for the
sale of a scrubber unit generally provide for deposits and installments through the procurement and design phases of equipment manufacturing.
Amounts invoiced to customers, which are not yet recorded as revenues under the Company’s revenue recognition policy, are presented
as contract liabilities.
Similarly, contractual arrangements with suppliers
and manufacturers normally involved with the manufacturing of scrubber units may require advances and deposits at various stages of the
manufacturing process. Payments to our manufacturing partners, which are not yet recorded as costs of goods sold under the Company’s
revenue recognition policy, are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs.
The Company presents the contract liabilities
and prepaid manufacturing costs on its balance sheet when one of the parties to the revenue contract and supply contract, respectively,
has performed before the other.
Accrued revenue is revenue that has been
earned by providing a good or service, but for which the Company has not yet billed the customer.
Accounts Receivable
We assess the collectability of accounts receivable
and long-term receivable on an ongoing basis and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is no longer reasonably
assured. In establishing the allowance, we consider factors such as known troubled accounts, historical experience, age, financial
information that is publicly accessible and other currently available evidence.
Warranty Provision
The Company reserves a 2% warranty provision on
the completion of a contract following the commissioning of marine scrubbers. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary
depending upon the product sold and geography of sale. The Company’s product warranties generally start from the commissioning date
and continue for up to twelve to twenty-four months. The Company provides warranties to customers for the design, materials, and installation
of scrubber units. The Company has a back-to-back manufacturing guarantee from its major supplier, which covers materials, production,
and installation. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product
operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures. These factors are estimates that may change based on new
information that becomes available each period. Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs
on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company’s judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company,
it is prudent to provide such repairs. The Company intends to assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjusts
the liability as necessary.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As a “smaller reporting company”,
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation (pursuant to
Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2022.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s
reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
as of December 31, 2022 due to the two material weaknesses identified and described below.
Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting
Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , and that our receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework).
In June 2022, while preparing the financial statements
for the year ending March 31, 2022, the Company identified an error with respect to the application of the revenue recognition accounting
policy. The Company has two material weaknesses; firstly, it lacked adequate controls to correctly recognize revenue and cost of goods
sold and, secondly, Certain amortization expenses, sales commissions, salaries and wages, and technical consulting fees should have been
presented within cost of goods. The control deficiency relates to the ineffective design of controls to analyze revenue contracts appropriately
on a timely basis and to identify certain costs as relating to the initiation and fulfilment of its revenue contracts.
Based on this evaluation our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no significant change in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s
evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
