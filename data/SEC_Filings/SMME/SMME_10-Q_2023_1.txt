CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to “SmartMetric, Inc.,” “SmartMetric,” “SMME,”
the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to SmartMetric, Inc. Also, any reference to
“common shares,” or “common stock” refers to our $0.001 par value common stock.
This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to our business development plans, timing
strategies, expectations, anticipated expense levels, business prospects, business outlook, technology spending and various other matters
(including contingent liabilities and obligations and changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations). These statements
express our current intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies or predictions as well as historical information. Words such as “expects,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
“may,” “will,” “could,” “continue,” and similar expressions or variations of such words
are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not deemed to represent an all-inclusive means of identifying forward-looking
statements as denoted in this Quarterly Report. Additionally, statements concerning future matters are forward-looking statements.
Although
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based
on facts and factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties
and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking
statements. These statements are no guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.
Our future operating results are dependent upon many factors which are outside our control. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, our ability to:
●
manage our business given
continuing operating losses and negative cash flows;
●
obtain sufficient capital
to fund our operations, development, and expansion plans;
●
manage competitive factors
and developments beyond our control;
●
maintain and protect our
intellectual property;
●
obtain patents based on
our current and/or future patent applications;
●
obtain and maintain other
rights to technology required or desirable to conduct or expand our business; and
●
manage any other factors,
if any, discussed in this report and in the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We
undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise
after the date of this Quarterly Report, except as required by federal securities laws. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider
the various disclosures made throughout the entirety of this Quarterly Report, which are designed to advise interested parties of the
risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

SMARTMETRIC,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE

-
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
SmartMetric,
Inc. (the “Company” or “SmartMetric”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric’s
main product is a fingerprint sensor-activated credit/debit card with a finger sensor onboard the card and a built-in rechargeable battery
for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card may be referred to as a biometric credit and or debit card or the
SmartMetric Biometric credit card. SmartMetric has completed development of its card along with pre-mass manufacturing cards and is now
in the final stages of production of its credit/debit biometric card. The release of this card is imminent.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments (which are of a
normal recurring nature) necessary for a fair presentation. Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023. For further information, refer to
the financial statements and the footnotes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2022. The consolidated balance sheet as
of June 30, 2022, has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information
and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements.
Going
Concern
As
shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements the Company has sustained recurring losses of $ 671,662
and $ 1,419,543
for the
six months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, has an accumulated deficit of $ 31,167,704 , and $ 30,496,042
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 respectively.
These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of this
filing. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts
or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19 has had an impact on SmartMetric’s final card production. While the delays are due to supply line disruption, the Company
is confident that these delays will be short-lived based on advice from our manufacturing partners, manufacturing alternatives and alternative
supply lines that are being put into place by the Company.
Management
believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors. These factors include product marketing and distribution.
The management plans include equity sales and borrowing in order to fund the operations.
There
are no assurances that the Company will be able to achieve the level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
to support the Company’s working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated are insufficient, the Company will have
to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be
on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available, the Company may not continue its operations.
In
December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread
worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”).
The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Like most businesses
world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially delaying the beginning of mass production.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)
As
of 2023, the company has seen its electronics assembly move forward following continued delays in 2020, 2021 and 2022. During the spans’
of these past three years SmartMetric was seriously impacted in its mass product development of its biometric credit card product.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, SmartMetric Australia
Pty. Ltd. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. SmartMetric Australia Pty Ltd.,
having no assets or bank accounts and no operations has been voluntarily dissolved as a corporation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to income taxes and contingencies.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Research
and Development
Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for
electronics design and engineering, software design and engineering, component sourcing, component engineering, manufacturing, product
trials, compensation and consulting costs.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
Loss
Per Share of Common Stock
In
accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” the basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss attributable
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic net loss per share excludes
the dilutive effect of stock options or warrants and convertible notes. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents,
consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock options and warrants. In periods where losses are reported, the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
19,935,352
and
69,163,518
dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
common share, with all dilutive shares being common stock warrants at December 31, 2022 and 2021, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation
and ASC 505-50,
Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees . All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued,
whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration
are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service
period, which is generally the vesting period.
Fair
value of financial instruments
The
Company measures fair value in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a three-level
valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are:
Level
1
- Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level
2
- Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability
through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.
Level
3
- Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
Valuation of instruments includes unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value
of assets or liabilities.
As
defined by ASC 820, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, which was further clarified as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (“an exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date.
The
reported fair values for financial instruments that use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of
factors and assumptions. Accordingly, certain fair values may not represent actual values of the Company’s financial instruments
that could have been realized as of December 31, 2022 or that will be recognized in the future, and do not include expenses that
could be incurred in an actual settlement. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash,
accounts receivable, receivables from related parties, prepaid expenses and other, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and related
party and third-party notes payables approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Company’s notes payable
to related parties approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management’s best estimate of terms that would be
available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2022.

until the expiration of the patents. As consideration, we issued Chaya Hendrick, or her assigns,
(i) 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, (ii) a royalty equal to 5% of gross revenues derived from products sold related to the patents, and (iii) certain minimum
required payments beginning at $50,000 and doubling each year thereafter. The Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at the election
of holder on a basis for 50 common shares for each preferred share at any time or an aggregate of 10,000,000 common shares in exchange
for all 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
Our
CEO maintains an employment agreement that stipulates a $ 190,000
annual salary. This agreement is in effect until mutual agreement between
its CEO and the Company to terminate.
Litigation
From
time to time, we may be a defendant or plaintiff in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. As of the
date of this Quarterly Report, there are no material pending legal or governmental proceedings relating to us or properties to which
we are a party, and, to our knowledge, there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates
are a party adverse to us or which have a material interest adverse to us.

DEBT
On
April 17, 2020, we received funds under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), a part of the CARES Act. The loan
is serviced by Chase Bank, and the application for these funds required us to, in good faith, certify that the current economic uncertainty
made the loan necessary to support our ongoing operations. We used the funds for payroll and related costs. The receipt of these funds,
and the forgiveness of the loan attendant to these funds, was dependent on our ability to adhere to the forgiveness criteria. The loan
bears interest at a rate of 0.98% per annum and had a maturity date of April 6, 2022, with the first payment being deferred until
April 17, 2021. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts may be forgiven if they are used in accordance with the CARES Act. The
Company applied for forgiveness of this loan as of October 2021 and forgiveness was granted by the Small Business Administration.
Therefore, the loan is considered paid in full.
On
March 5, 2020, the Company issued a $ 35,000
10 % convertible note to GHS Investments, LLC, in relation to an equity financing agreement
(see Note 6). The note was due on December 5, 2020 and is convertible at a rate of $ 0.0175
per share which resulted in a discount
from the beneficial conversion feature totaling $ 5,000 . As of March 31, 2022, the note has been paid in full.

Equity
Financing Agreement
On
March 5, 2020, the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the “Equity Financing Agreement”) with GHS Investments,
LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GHS”). Pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to
GHS an indeterminate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”),
up to an aggregate price of four million dollars ($4,000,000).
Following
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
Company shall have the discretion to deliver puts to GHS and GHS will be obligated to
purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock based on the investment amount specified in each put notice. The maximum amount that
the Company shall be entitled to put to GHS in each put notice shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the average daily trading
dollar volume of the Company’s Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days preceding the put, so long as such dollar amount does
not exceed $500,000. Pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS and its affiliates will not be permitted to purchase and the Company
may not put shares of the Company’s Common Stock to GHS that would result in GHS’s beneficial ownership, equalling more than
4.99% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock. The price of each put share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Market
Price (as defined in the Equity Financing Agreement). Puts may be delivered by the Company to GHS until the earlier of thirty-six (36)
months after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
Concurrently
with the execution of the Equity Financing Agreement, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note, for the principal balance
of $ 35,000 . Per the terms of the convertible promissory note, the Company agreed to pay GHS interest at the rate of ten percent ( 10 %)
until it became due on December 5, 2020. The holder of the convertible promissory note shall have the right at any time to convert
all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest at a fixed conversion price of $ 0.0175 . See Note 5. The principal
balance of $ 35,000
was been recognized as deferred financing costs in current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet,
and was charged against the gross proceeds of each put when received. As of the date of this filing, the note has been paid in full.

MANDATORY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Issuances
of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock
On
January 10, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a resolution pursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation,
as amended, providing for the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions, of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock.
On
January 14, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations for its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The authorized number
of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is
1,000,000
shares, par value
0.001 . The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will, with respect
to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, rank: (a) senior with respect to dividends and right of liquidation
with the Company’s common stock, (b) junior with respect to dividends and right of liquidation with respect to the Company’s
Series B Preferred Stock, and (c) junior with respect to dividends and right of liquidation to all existing indebtedness of the Company.
The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will carry an annual ten percent ( 10 %) cumulative dividend, compounded daily, payable solely
upon redemption, liquidation or conversion. The Company will have a right, at any time in the period of 180 days from the date of the
issuance, at the Company’s option, to redeem all or any portion of the Series C Preferred Stock at prices ranging from
105 % to
130 %, based on the passage of time.
The
number of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding were
17,300
and
65,425 , respectively, for December 31,
2022 and June 30, 2022.
The
holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right at any time during the period beginning on the date which is six
(6) months following the date of their issuance, to convert all or any part of the outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at the Variable Conversion Price. The “Variable Conversion Price” shall
mean 71% multiplied by the Market Price (representing a discount rate of 29%). “Market Price” means the average of the two
(2) lowest Trading Prices (which means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the OTCQB, OTCQX, Pink Sheets electronic
quotation system or applicable trading market (the “OTC”) as reported by a reliable reporting service (“Reporting Service”)
designated by the holder (i.e. Bloomberg) for the common stock during the fifteen (15) Trading Day Period ending on the latest complete
Trading Day prior to the date of conversion (both terms as defined in the Certificate of Designations).

NOTE

-
MANDATORY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (CONTINUED)
The
Series C Convertible Preferred stock is convertible after six months at
71 % of the average market price of the Company’s stock
based on the lowest two (2) market closes fifteen (15) days prior. Consequently, the shares were converted at different rates. The Company
assessed the conversion feature and determined it was required to be bifurcated and recognized as a derivative liability. Three (3) batches
of Preferred stock were subject to derivative liability valuation based on the Black Scholes Merton pricing model. As the fair value
of each of the three (3) derivative and the shares issued at inception were in excess of the face amount of the Preferred stock, the
Company recorded a discount in the amount of $ 35,000
to be amortized utilizing the effective interest method of accretion over the term
of the note.
On
the date which is eighteen (18) months following the Issuance Date or upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (the “Mandatory
Redemption Date”), the Company shall redeem all of the shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the holder (which have
not been previously redeemed or converted). Within five (5) days of the Mandatory Redemption Date, the Company shall make payment to
each holder of an amount in cash equal to the total number of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder multiplied
by the then current Stated Value.
All
shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock have been presented outside of permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities . The Company accretes the carrying value of its Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock to its estimate of fair value ( i.e. , redemption value) at period end.
The
carrying value of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 15,728
and $ 59,478
net
of discount, respectively.
There were 0 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued for net proceeds of $0, and 0 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock converted to 0 shares of common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
NOTE

-
DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
The
conversion rates of the convertible notes and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible at a variable rate. Accordingly, the
Company concluded there is an embedded derivative which was required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability. The
Company chose to use the Black Scholes model to calculate the derivative liability. The assumptions in the derivative liability calculation
included the price of the Company’s common stock of $ 0.0141
at the valuation date, term of zero, a risk-free rate of between $ 0.0010
and $ 0.0011
and a volatility rate of between
150 % and
341 %. The Company has recorded the embedded derivative liability at its’
fair value utilizing the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model, as follows:

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed
in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Overview
SmartMetric,
Inc. is a company engaged in the biometric technology industry. SmartMetric has secured a patent covering technology that involves connection
to networks using data cards (smart cards and EMV cards). In addition, SmartMetric holds the sole license to issued patents covering
features of its biometric fingerprint activated cards. SmartMetric’s main product is a fingerprint sensor activated payments card
with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The cards have a rechargeable battery allowing
for portable biometric identification and card activation. These cards are herein sometimes referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric
Biometric card.
To
date, we have devoted a substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the development of our biometric card. Since our
inception in 2002, we have generated no revenue from product sales and have funded our operations principally through the private sales
of our equity securities. We have never been profitable and, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$31,167,704 and $30,496,042 respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of
our technologies and advance them to market.
Our
cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2022 was approximately $42,998 representing 65.0% of total assets. Notwithstanding
our recent capital raises, based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, we expect to be able to fund our operations
into 2023. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending that were not anticipated or other unforeseen
events.
We
anticipate raising additional cash through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities to continue to fund our operations
and the development of our technologies. There is no assurance that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us
to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may
be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop our ongoing clinical trials, cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy. We currently
do not have commitments for future funding from any source.
Going
Concern
The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the
carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.
As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the Company has incurred recurring losses of $671,662 and $1,419,543 for
the six-month period ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively and has incurred a cumulative loss of $31,167,704
and $30,496,042 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 - since our inception in December 18, 2022. The Company is currently in
the development stage and has spent a substantial portion of its time in the development of its technology.
There
is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern beyond calendar year 2023. The Company maintains
sufficient cash to continue as a going concern throughout all of calendar year 2023.
15
Management
believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors. These factors include the final phase of development
and mass production being successful as well as product implementation and distribution.
The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying
amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Effect
of Covid-19
In
December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread
worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”).
COVID-19 poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Like most businesses world-wide,
the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially. Further, the COVID-19 Pandemic, has had an impact on SmartMetric’s
final card production. While the delays are due to supply line disruption, the Company is confident that these delays will be short-lived
based on advice from our manufacturing partners, manufacturing alternatives and alternative supply lines that are being put into place
by the Company. However, management cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
SmartMetric’s
commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation
of global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions
on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms, frequent disinfecting of our locations
and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19
pandemic is adequately contained for our business.
In
the near-term, our operating results are going to be challenged due to this crisis. We continue to manage our cost structure to meet
the uncertain demand, while making additional cost reductions as needed. Our customers’ businesses are subject to the fluctuations
in global economic cycles and conditions and other business risk factors which may impact their ability to operate their businesses.
The performance and financial condition of our customers may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular
customer. Further, the potential impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on their businesses could adversely impact our customers’ ability
to pay us for work performed, increasing our future estimate of credit losses.

Critical
Accounting Policies
We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires
management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base
these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based
upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our
operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon
as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
All
of the Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial
statements, included above in this Quarterly Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates,
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the
presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
our financial statements:
Development
Costs
Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for
electronics design and engineering, software design and engineering, component sourcing, component engineering, manufacturing, product
trials, compensation and consulting costs. Due to the small size of the Company’s research & development staff as well as the
lack of any long term research and development-related contracts, we do not believe that the use of this critical accounting estimate
will have a material impact on the results of financial operations.
Results
of Operations
Comparison
of the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Our
results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future. We
did not have revenue for the three months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. Net loss for the three months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021 were $253,716 and $322,261, respectively, resulting from the operational activities described below.

Operating
Expenses
Operating
expense totalled $114,789 and $359,110 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in operating
expenses is the result of lower consulting expenses and legal expenses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
have incurred losses since our inception in 2002 as a result of significant expenditures for operations and research and development and
the lack of any revenue. We have an accumulated deficit of $31,167,704 as of December 31, 2022 and anticipate that we will continue
to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Through December 31, 2022, we have funded our operations through the private
sale of our equity securities and exercises of options and warrants, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $28.5 million from inception
through December 31, 2022.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We
are not required to provide the information required by this item as we are considered a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).
ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with
the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls are
procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized,
recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit the preparation of our condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives.
In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Limitations
on Controls
Management
does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions
and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected.
Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However,
to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions are being performed by
separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties in all of our financially significant
processes and have concluded that this control deficiency represented a material weakness. We plan to remediate this weakness over the
next 12 months.
20
Notwithstanding
the assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and
that there are material weaknesses as identified herein, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in
this Form 10-Q fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby in all
material respects.
Changes
in Internal Controls
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
