All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash
and cash equivalents
The
Company considers short-term interest-bearing investments with initial maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company has
no
cash equivalents.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents in a financial institution, which at times, may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $ 250,000 .
The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such
accounts.
Financial
Instruments
The
fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,”
approximates the carrying amounts represented in the consolidated balance sheet except as noted in the Fair Value Measurement section
described below.
Foreign
Currencies
Revenue
and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
In
accordance with ASC 606,
Revenues from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under
the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services.
The
following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues.
The
following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues:
Company-owned
Store Sales
The
Company-owned stores principally generate revenue from retail esports gaming centers. Revenues from Company-owned stores are recognized
when the products are delivered, or the service is provided. After hours, the Company also mines for crypto currency using the computer
equipment at the company-owned stores. Crypto mining revenue is recognized as the mining occurs. As of November 30, 2022, all Company-owned
store have been sold or closed.
9
Franchise
Revenues
Franchise
revenues consist of royalties, fees and initial license fee income. Franchise royalties are based on six percent of franchise store sales
after a minimum level of sales occur and are recognized as sales occur. Any royalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as
part of a new store development incentive or as incentive for other behaviors, are recognized at the same time as the related royalty,
as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis.
The
Company recognizes initial franchise license fee revenue when the Company has performed substantially all the services required in the
franchise agreement. Fees received that do not meet these criteria are recorded as deferred revenues until earned. The pre-opening services
provided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right; thus, the fees collected
will be amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the store opening date through the term of the franchise agreement, which is
typically
10
years. Franchise license renewal fees, which generally occur every 10 years, are billed before the renewal date. Fees received
for future license renewal periods are amortized over the life of the renewal period.
The
Company offers various incentive programs for franchisees including royalty incentives, new store opening incentives (i.e. development
incentives) and other support initiatives. Royalties and franchise fees sales are reduced to reflect any royalty incentives earned or
granted under these programs that are in the form of discounts.
Commissary
sales are comprised of gaming equipment and supplies sold to franchised stores and are recognized as revenue upon shipment or delivery
of the related products to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days.
Fees
for information services, including software maintenance fees, marketing fees and website maintenance, graphic and promotion fees are
recognized as revenue as such services are provided.
Esports
Revenue
Esports
is a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, esports takes the form of organized, single player and multiplayer video game
tournaments or leagues, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Revenues from Esports revenues are recognized
when the competition is completed, and prize money is awarded. Revenues earned from team sponsorships, prize winnings, league sponsorships,
and from the Company’s share of league revenues are included in esports revenue.
Deferred
Revenues
Deferred
revenues are classified as current or long-term based on when management estimates the revenues will be recognized.
The
Company receives payments from franchisees in advance of all performance obligations having been met, including but not limited to franchise
locations being opened. As certain conditions agreed to in these franchise agreements are performed, revenues are recognized.
Deferred
costs include commissions paid to brokers related to the sale of specific new franchises which have not met revenue recognition criteria
as of November 30, 2022, and May 31, 2022. These costs are recognized in the same period as the initial franchise fee revenue is recognized.
The
table below summarizes Deferred Revenues as of November 30, 2022:

Accounts
Receivable
The
Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of specific customers (i.e. franchisees), taking into consideration
the age of past due accounts and an assessment of the customer’s ability to pay. Accounts receivable are written off against the
allowance when management determines it is probable the receivable is worthless. Customer account balances with invoices dated over 90
days old are considered delinquent and considered in the allowance assessment. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers
and, generally, requires no collateral. Management has assessed accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately
$ 71,708
and $ 39,000
has been recorded as of November 30, 2022, and May 31, 2022, respectively.
Inventory
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. The company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs
or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions. The Company has recorded an impairment of approximately
$ 8,224
and $ 83,957
during the three months and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively, related
to the closure of Company owned stores.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at its historical cost. The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over
the estimated useful lives, when placed in service (ranging from
3
- 5
years), of the related assets utilizing the straight-line method
of depreciation. The cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated (amortized) over the lesser of the length of the related leases or
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred and major repairs will be capitalized
and expensed if they benefit future periods.
The
Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be
recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by
determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total
of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
the fair value less costs to sell. The Company has recorded impairment charges of approximately $ 51,555
and $ 177,177
during
the three months and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively, related to the closure of Company owned stores .
Intangible
Assets and Impairment
Intangible
assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. Assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually. These costs were included
in intangible assets on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives
of the costs, which is
3
to
5
years.
The
Company periodically reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less that the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s
estimated fair value and its book value. During the six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company performed an internal evaluation of
the intangible assets which indicated impairment was required and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $ 1,007,142
during the
six months ended November 30, 2022, see Note 5. The impairment charges recorded during the quarter relate to the Company’s intention
to potentially integrate a software company through a previously announced acquisition which may close in the future, provided that multiple
precedent conditions have been met.
11
Goodwill
Goodwill
is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize goodwill, but we
assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually. Our assessment date is May 31, and we performed an internal evaluation of the goodwill
value at August 31, 2022 with quantitative and qualitative considerations. Based on this internal evaluation, we recorded an impairment
charge of $ 1,472,884
during the three months ended August 31, 2022 resulting in no goodwill remaining on the financial statements after
that date. The impairment charges recorded during the quarter relate to the Company’s intention to potentially integrate a software
company through a previously announced acquisition which may in the future, provided that multiple precedent conditions have been met.
F ranchise
Locations
Through
PLAYlive, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Company has entered into franchise agreements with third parties. As of November
30, 2022, six franchise locations were considered to be operational in various states including California, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, South
Carolina, and Texas,
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,

and ASC 505-50,
Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees . All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued,
whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration
are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service
period, which is generally the vesting period.
Non-employee
stock-based payments
The
Company records stock-based payments made to non-employees in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07,
Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,
which aligns accounting
for share-based payments issued to nonemployees to that of employees under the existing guidance of Topic 718, with certain exceptions.
Usage
of Authorized but Unissued Shares of Common Stock
As
of November 30, 2022, the Company was authorized to issue
36,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001
per share
(the “Common Stock”). On January 20, 2023, the Company filed the Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to increase the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock from
36,000,000
to
250,000,000 . Accordingly, following the filing of the Amendment, the Company has
250,000,000
authorized shares of
Common Stock. Holders of the shares of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share. The Company has issued options,
warrants and convertible promissory notes which are convertible into shares of Common Stock in certain situations the total of which
exceeds the current authorization. The Company has adopted a policy for the sequence of usage of remaining authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock (the “Sequencing Policy”) which outlines the order in which the conversion of these equity-linked
instruments may be settled in shares. Under the Company’s Sequencing Policy, the most recently issued equity-linked
securities, including stock options, warrants, and convertible promissory notes, are settled in shares first.
12
Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share
The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Net income (loss) –
per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income or loss available
to common stockholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. For this calculation
potentially dilutive securities consist primarily of warrants, outstanding options and shares into which the company’s convertible
notes payable are convertible. When the Company records a loss from operations, all potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive and
are consequently excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. The following table shows the computation of basic
and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021:

Income
Taxes
The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ,” which requires an
asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed
for differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable
or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC
Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statements recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
Fair
Value Measurements
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include :
●
Level
1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level
2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets or liabilities.
●
Level
3 inputs are unobservable and reflect the Company’s own assumptions.
Other
than the derivative liability, the Company does not have a material amount of financial assets or liabilities that are required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis under U.S. GAAP. None of the Company’s non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities
are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The
Company has not elected to use fair value measurement for any assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement is not presently
required by U.S. GAAP. However, the Company believes the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts
payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.
13
Recently
Issued and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting
standards promulgated by the FASB are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on the Company’s future financial
statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial
instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features
from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts
in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments
that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including
the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective June 1, 2023 and should be applied
on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is evaluating the
impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on the Company’s financial statements.
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Earning Per Share (Topic 260) ,
Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50) ,
Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) , and
Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40) , which clarified and reduced diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications of exchanges of freestanding equity-classified
written call options (such as warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This update will be effective for
the Company as of June 1, 2023. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2021-04 to our consolidated financial
statements.
Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Going
Concern, Liquidity and Management’s Plan
The
Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As
reflected in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, as of November 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 28,443,843 ,
a working capital deficit of $ 10,106,601 , net income attributable to the common shareholders of $ 5,551,711
for the three months ended
November 30, 2022, and net income attributable to common shareholders of $ 1,394,601
for the six months ended November 30, 2022. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the of the date
that the unaudited financial statements are issued.
14
The
Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional
funds by way of private and/or public offerings. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy and its ability to generate
sufficient revenue and to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Should the Company fail to raise additional
capital, it may be compelled to reduce the scope of its planned future business activities.
The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business
plan, to generate sufficient revenue and to raise additional funds by way of public and/or private offerings.
The
unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.
In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely
concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections
have been reported globally.
Because
COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued
stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations
and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers were closed
effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Gaming Centers as of May 1, 2020, and subsequently reopened the majority of
our company owned stores and franchise locations. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Gaming Centers require
a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers are operating,
there is a potential risk that franchisees of Simplicity Gaming Centers will default in their obligations to pay their minimum monthly
royalty payment to us resulting in either an increase in accounts receivables or a bad debt expense where account receivables are no
longer collectible due to franchisee’s inability to pay the minimum monthly royalty payments owed by the franchisee.
The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may
emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or
the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced
operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The
measures taken to date impacted the Company’s business for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, as well as the fiscal quarter ended
November 30, 2022, and will potentially continue to impact the Company’s business. Management expects that all of its business
segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak
on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Kaplan
Promissory Notes
On
December 10, 2021, the Company entered into a related party transaction with Jed Kaplan, the Company’s then Chairman of the Board
and a more than 5% shareholder, to provide a loan to the Company to provide additional operating funds for Simplicity One, the Company’s
majority owned subsidiary. The principal amount of the loan was $ 247,818 . The loan bears interest at a rate of
5 % per annum and the entire
amount of the principal and accrued interest was due on
June 10, 2022 . On June 10, 2022, the loan and accrued interest of $ 6,178
were
converted into a 17% equity stake in Simplicity One, increasing Kaplan’s total stake to 37% and reducing the Company’s stake

to designate one share of the Company’s preferred stock as the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series X Preferred”).
The one share of Series X Preferred has a number of votes equal to all of the other votes entitled to be cast on any matter by any other

share of Series X Preferred may not be transferred after issuance. If any transfer is attempted, the Series X Preferred will be automatically

At

DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
Upon
the issuance of the September 2022 FirstFire Note, September 2022 Ionic Note, and September 2022 Jefferson Note described above, the
conversion price of certain equity-linked instruments decreased to $ 0.02
per share. With this decrease, the number of shares of Common
Stock into which these instruments were convertible exceeded the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. After application of
the Company’s Sequencing Policy, the Company record a derivative liability related to the shares underlying these instruments that
exceeded the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock the pursuant to ASC 815.
During
the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded the derivative liability on
226,172,445
shares of Common Stock underlying
certain warrant and convertible promissory notes by first analyzing the fair value of the derivative liability shares utilizing the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: (i) conversion price of the applicable instrument; (ii) expected dividend yield
of
0 %; (iii) expected volatility ranging from
130.3 % to
305.4 %; (iv) risk-free interest rates ranging from
3.2 % to
4.1 %; and (v) expected
remaining term ranging from
0.66
to
2.88
years. While the Company utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for recording of the
derivative liabilities, a supplemental analysis was conducted utilizing the binomial tree model with identical inputs as used in the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This analysis resulted in fair value with immaterial, de minimus variances.
For
the convertible promissory notes, the Company assessed whether, at inception, the convertible promissory note contained a debt discount
equal to or less than the original principal value of the instrument. In such cases where the original debt discount was less than the
original principal value of the note, the Company recorded a new debt discount that is to be accreted over the remaining term of the
note. The difference between the value of the derivative liability as described above and the debt discount, if any, is recorded to additional
paid in capital.
During
the reporting period, any conversions of convertible promissory notes into shares of Common Stock or other issuances of Common Stock
are assessed. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, after the recording of the original derivative liability, the Company
recorded a derivative liability on as additional
500,000
shares of Common Stock at the then current inputs to the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model.
At
the end of the reporting period, the fair market value of the derivative liability is remeasured utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with then-current inputs. Any resulting variances in the derivative liability are recorded as a gain or loss on the measurement
of the liability in the income statement.
During
the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded an initial aggregate derivative liability of $ 10,832,403 ,
with adjustment during the periods of a decrease in the derivative liability of $ 52,574 .
Offsetting these amounts, the Company recorded $ 10,485,603
to
additional paid in capital and $ 294,227
in
new debt discount. At the end of the reporting period, the Company remeasured the fair market value of the aggregate derivative
liability resulting in a gain on change in value of the derivative liability of $ 7,389,820 ,
recorded on the statement of operations, bringing the ending balance of the derivative liability to $ 3,390,009 .
In addition, during the reporting period, the Company recorded $ 127,407
in
interest expense related to the new debt discount.

table below presents the derivative liability balances as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022:

Overview
We
are an esports organization, that is capitalizing on the growth in esports
through two business units: PLAYlive Nation, Inc. (“PLAYlive”) and Simplicity One Brasil Ltda (“Simplicity One”).
During the first quarter of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, in an effort to focus on business operations that were currently profitable,
the Company sold its League of Legends franchise asset, and exited business operations in Brazil. Funding the Brazilian business operations
created a monthly cash burn of approximately $45,000. The Company sold the franchise asset to Brazilian esports organization Los Grandes
for total consideration of 1,920,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately $392,000 as of June 10, 2022, the closing date of the sale) to be
paid in five equal quarterly installments.

Our
Gaming Centers
As
of November 30, 2022 and March 8, 2023, our operations consisted of six
and six locations, respectively, throughout the U.S., giving casual gamers the opportunity to play in a social setting with other members
of the gaming community, with no corporate owned locations as of November 30, 2022. Management is exploring strategic alternatives, including
merger and acquisition opportunities, and is focused on high margin, lower capital expenditure business strategies in the esports gaming
industry, specifically focused on software development and software as a service for the family entertainment industry.
In
addition, aspiring and established professional gamers have an opportunity to compete in local and national esports tournaments held
in our gaming centers for prizes, notoriety, and potential contracts to play for one of our professional esports teams. In this business
unit, revenue is generated from franchise royalties, the sale of game time, memberships, tournament entry fees, birthday party events,
corporate party events, concessions and gaming-related merchandise.
Optimally,
the esports gaming centers of Simplicity Esports LLC (“Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers”) measure between 2,000 and 4,000
square feet, with dozens of gaming stations. The Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers feature cutting edge technology, futuristic aesthetic
décor and dynamic high-speed gaming equipment. We believe our brick-and-click strategy will present attractive opportunities for
sponsors and advertisers to connect with our audience, creating an intriguing monetization opportunity for sponsors and advertisers.
Corporate
Gaming Centers
As
of November 30, 2022, all Company-owned store have been sold or closed. Management is exploring strategic alternatives, including
merger and acquisition opportunities, and is focused on high margin, lower capital expenditure business strategies in the esports
gaming and entertainment industry.
44
Franchised
Gaming Centers
As
of November 30, 2022 and March 8, 2023, we had six and six franchised locations, respectively. Due to interest from potential franchisees,
in 2019 we launched a franchising program to accelerate the expansion of our planned nationwide footprint. We sell specific franchise
territories, through our wholly owned subsidiary PLAYlive, and assist with the establishment and buildout of esports gaming centers to
potential business owners that desire to use our branding, infrastructure and process to open and operate gaming centers. We currently
operate six fully constructed franchise esports gaming centers.
Franchise revenue is generated from
the sale of franchise territories, supplying furniture, equipment and merchandise to the franchisees for buildout of their centers, a
gross sales royalty fee and a national marketing fee. We license the use of our branding, assist in identifying and negotiating commercial
locations, assist in overseeing the buildout and development, provide access to proprietary software for point of sale, inventory management,
employee training and other HR functions. Franchisees also have an opportunity to participate in our national esports tournament events.
Once an esports gaming center is opened, we provide operational guidance, support and use of branding elements in exchange for a monthly
royalty fee calculated as 6% of gross sales. Prior to selling a franchise, among other things, the Company is required to provide a potential
franchisee with a franchise disclosure document. We do not currently have an active franchise disclosure document.
45
COVID-19
As
a result of COVID-19, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced
reopening Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020, and subsequently reopened the majority of its Simplicity Gaming Centers.
Subsequently, the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate owned esports gaming center locations. As of November 30, 2022, our operations
consisted of six franchisee owned locations. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers
require a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers
are operating, a limited number of the franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers have defaulted on their obligations to pay their
minimum monthly royalty payment to us. This has resulted in either an increase in accounts receivables or a bad debt expense where account
receivables are no longer collectible due to franchisee’s inability to pay the minimum monthly royalty payments owed by the franchisee.
As of November 30, 2022, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $71,708 and have written off $29,829, partly
in conjunction with taking back certain franchises and converting them to company owned stores. Notwithstanding our efforts to support
franchisees and still collect on receivables, it is unclear exactly how much of the increase in accounts receivables is attributable
to the impact of COVID-19. Beginning in July 2020, we have waived the minimum monthly royalty payment obligations and are instead billing
the franchisees a true-up of 6% of gross sales without a minimum. We continue to assess possible similar accommodations to the franchisees
in light of the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the disruptions in commercial real estate caused by COVID-19 lockdowns have allowed
the Company to strengthen its existing relationships with national landlords by signing new locations with percentage rent leases.
The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may
emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or
the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced
operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The
measures taken to date adversely impacted the Company’s business during the quarter ended November 30, 2022 and will potentially
continue to impact the Company’s business. Management observes that all business segments continue to be impacted by reduced foot
traffic that began as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and has continued as consumer habits have changed.
Our
Financial Position
For
the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues of $175,317 and $843,815, respectively, and reported net income
(loss) attributable to common shareholders of $5,551,711 and $(2,129,297), respectively.
For
the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues of $519,430 and $1,748,655, respectively, reported net income
(loss) attributable to common shareholders of $1,394,601 and $(6,340,204), respectively, and had cash flow used in operating activities
of $517,598 and $2,105,623, respectively. As of November 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $28,443,843.
There
is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our historical recurring losses and negative
cash flows from operations, as well as our dependence on private equity and financings.

Summary
of Statement of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended November 30, 2022 and 2021:
Revenue
For
the three months ended November 30, 2022, our revenues decreased by $668,498, as compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021.
For the six months ended November 30, 2021, our revenues decreased by $1,229,225, as compared to the six months ended November 30, 2021.
These decreases were primarily due to the decrease in both the number of company-owned stores and franchised locations.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Cost
of goods sold for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $73,448 and $485,394, respectively, representing a decrease
of $411,946 primarily due to decreased revenues. Cost of goods sold for the six months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $167,896
and $1,902,516, respectively, representing a decrease of $924,620 primarily due to decreased revenues.
Operating
Expenses
Compensation
and related benefits
Compensation
and related benefits for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $230,099 and $845,886, respectively, representing a decrease
of $615,787. Compensation and related benefits for the six months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $793,540 and $2,149,012, respectively,
representing a decrease of $1,355,472. Compensation and related benefits consist of salaries and stock-based compensation, health benefits
and related payroll taxes. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the number of employees and lower stock-based compensation
expense.
Professional
fees
Professional
fees for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $197,385 and $129,723, respectively, representing an increase of $67,662.
The increase in expenses is primarily due to increased accounting fees in the current period related to the annual audit. Professional
fees for the six months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 was $276,756 and $579,076, respectively, representing a decrease of $302,320.
Professional fees consist of costs for audits, accountants, attorneys, consultants and the costs for other experts. The decrease is primarily
due to the decrease in legal expenses related to issuance of debt instruments during the prior period.
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2022, was $260,328 as compared to $432,127 for the three months ended
November 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $171,799. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended November 30, 2022,
was $533,754 as compared to $875,822 for the six months ended November 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $342,068. The decrease is
primarily due to the decrease in the number of company-owned stores and the associated expenses (rent, utilities, computer expenses,
insurance) to maintain the stores.
Loss
from Operations
For
the three months ended November 30, 2022, loss from operations amounted to $1,049,348 as compared to $1,049,315 for the three months
ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $33. For the six months ended November 30, 2022, loss from operations amounted to
$4,511,237 as compared to $2,947,771 for the six months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $1,563,466.
47
Other
Expense
For
the three months ended November 30, 2022, other income amounted to $6,594,583 as compared to other loss of $1,116,411 for the three months
ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $7,710,994. The increase in other income and expenses was primarily attributable
to the recognition of a change in the derivative liability $7,389,820 and a gain on the disposition of certain assets of $154,348, both
without comparable activity in the prior period. These were offset by a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $223,924 during the three
months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to a gain of $29,168 during the prior quarter as well as interest expense of $720,714 during
the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $1,145,794 during the prior period.
For
the six months ended November 30, 2022, other income amounted to $5,971,624 as compared to other expense of $3,483,699 for the six months
ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $9,455,323. The increase in other income and expenses was primarily attributable
to the recognition of a change in the derivative liability $7,389,820 and a gain on the disposition of certain assets of $395,272, both
without comparable activity in the prior period. These were offset by a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $275,498 during the six
months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to a loss of $1,730,801 during the prior period as well as interest expense of $1,567,831
during the six months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $1,805,490 during the prior period.
Net
Income (Loss)
Net
income for the three months ended November 30, 2022, was $5,545,235 as compared to a net loss of $2,165,726 for the three months
ended November 30, 2021, representing an improvement of $7,710,961. Net income for the six months ended November 30, 2022, was
$1,460,387 as compared to a net loss of $6,431,470 for the six months ended November 30, 2021, representing an improvement of
$7,891,857.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of November 30, 2022, we had cash of $64,074, which is available for use by us to cover the Company’s costs. In addition, as of
November 30, 2022, we had accrued expenses of $1,848,701.
For
the six months ended November 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities amounted to $517,598 primarily resulting from a net income
of $1,460,387; non cash interest expense of $1,440,139, representing a decrease of $256,256 over the prior period; impairment losses
of $3,261,186 with no comparable activity in the prior period; a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $275,498, representing a decrease
of $1,455,303 from the prior period; and stock-based compensation expense of $165,179, representing a decrease of $1,053,635 from the
prior period. These adjustments were offset by a change in the derivative liability of $7,389,820 with no comparable activity in the
prior period and a $395,272 gain on the disposition of certain assets, representing an increase of $392,915 over the prior period. Changes
in our operating liabilities and assets provided cash of $553,851.
We
will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business.
Going
Concern
The
Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As
reflected in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, as of November 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $28,443,843,
a working capital deficit of $10,106,601, net income attributable to the common shareholders of $5,551,711 for the three months ended
November 30, 2022, and net income attributable to common shareholders of $1,394,601 for the six months ended November 30, 2022. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the of the date
that the unaudited financial statements are issued.
48
The
Company has an operational business and generates revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support
the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of private and/or public offerings. While the
Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there
can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s
ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a
public or private offering.
The
unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.
As
a result of COVID-19, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced
reopening Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020, and subsequently reopened a majority of its Simplicity Gaming Centers. Subsequently,
the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate-owned esports gaming center locations. As of November 30, 2022, our operations consisted of
six franchisee owned locations. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Esports
Gaming Centers require a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Esports
Gaming Centers are operating, a limited number of the franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers have defaulted on their obligations
to pay their minimum monthly royalty payment to us. Beginning in July 2020, we have waived the minimum monthly royalty payment obligations
and are instead billing the franchisees a true-up of 6% of gross sales without a minimum. We continue to assess possible similar accommodations
to the franchisees in light of the impact of COVID-19. The franchisees’ defaults have resulted in either an increase in accounts
receivables or a bad debt expense where account receivables are no longer collectible due to franchisee’s inability to pay the
minimum monthly royalty payments owed by the franchisee. As of November 30, 2022, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately
$71,708 and have written off $29,829, partly in conjunction with taking back certain franchises and converting them to company owned
stores. Notwithstanding our efforts to support franchisees and still collect on receivables, it is unclear exactly how much of the increase
in accounts receivables is attributable to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the disruptions in commercial real estate caused by
COVID-19 lockdowns have allowed the Company to strengthen its existing relationships with national landlords by signing new locations
with percentage rent leases.
The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may
emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or
the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced
operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The
measures taken to date adversely impacted the Company’s business during the quarter ended November 30, 2022, and will potentially
continue to impact the Company’s business. Management observes that all business segments continue to be impacted by reduced foot
traffic that began as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and has continued as consumer habits have changed.
Off-balance
sheet financing arrangements
We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased
any non-financial assets.
49
Contractual
obligations
We
do not have any long-term capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, except as follows:
Operating
Leases
We
have long-term operating lease obligations and deferred revenues related to franchise fees to be recognized over the term of franchise
agreements with our franchises, generally ten years. We will begin to recognize deferred franchise fee revenue at the time a franchise
commences operations.
The
Company is party to operating leases at its corporate office and at each of its company-owned store locations which have various terms
and payments.

Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses
during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
In
accordance with ASC 606,
Revenues from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under
the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services.
The
following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues.
The
following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues:
Company-owned
Store Sales
The
Company-owned stores principally generate revenue from retail esports gaming centers. Revenues from Company-owned stores are recognized
when the products are delivered, or the service is provided. After hours, the Company also mines for crypto currency using the computer
equipment at the company-owned stores. Crypto mining revenue is recognized as the mining occurs. As of November 30, 2022, all Company-owned
store have been sold or closed.
Franchise
Revenues
Franchise
revenues consist of royalties, fees and initial license fee income. Franchise royalties are based on six percent of franchise store sales
after a minimum level of sales occur and are recognized as sales occur. Any royalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as
part of a new store development incentive or as incentive for other behaviors, are recognized at the same time as the related royalty,
as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis.
The
Company recognizes initial franchise license fee revenue when the Company has performed substantially all the services required in the
franchise agreement. Fees received that do not meet these criteria are recorded as deferred revenues until earned. The pre-opening services
provided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right; thus, the fees collected
will be amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the store opening date through the term of the franchise agreement, which is
typically 10 years. Franchise license renewal fees, which generally occur every 10 years, are billed before the renewal date. Fees received
for future license renewal periods are amortized over the life of the renewal period.
The
Company offers various incentive programs for franchisees including royalty incentives, new store opening incentives (i.e. development
incentives) and other support initiatives. Royalties and franchise fees sales are reduced to reflect any royalty incentives earned or
granted under these programs that are in the form of discounts.
Commissary
sales are comprised of gaming equipment and supplies sold to franchised stores and are recognized as revenue upon shipment or delivery
of the related products to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days.
Fees
for information services, including software maintenance fees, marketing fees and website maintenance, graphic and promotion fees are
recognized as revenue as such services are provided.
67
Esports
Revenue
Esports
is a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, esports takes the form of organized, single player and multiplayer video game
tournaments or leagues, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Revenues from Esports revenues are recognized
when the competition is completed, and prize money is awarded. Revenues earned from team sponsorships, prize winnings, league sponsorships,
and from the Company’s share of league revenues are included in esports revenue.
Accounts
Receivable
The
Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of specific customers (i.e. franchisees), taking into consideration
the age of past due accounts and an assessment of the customer’s ability to pay. Accounts receivable are written off against the
allowance when management determines it is probable the receivable is worthless. Customer account balances with invoices dated over 90
days old are considered delinquent and considered in the allowance assessment. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers
and, generally, requires no collateral.
Intangible
Assets and Impairment
Intangible
assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. Assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually. These costs were included
in intangible assets on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives
of the costs, which is 3 to 5 years.
The
Company periodically reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less that the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s
estimated fair value and its book value.
Goodwill
Goodwill
is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize goodwill, but we
assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually.
Fair
Value Measurements
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include :
●
Level
1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level
2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets or liabilities.
●
Level
3 inputs are unobservable and reflect the Company’s own assumptions.
Other
than the derivative liability, the Company does not have a material amount of financial assets or liabilities that are required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis under U.S. GAAP. None of the Company’s non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities
are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The
Company has not elected to use fair value measurement for any assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement is not presently
required by U.S. GAAP. However, the Company believes the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts
payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.
