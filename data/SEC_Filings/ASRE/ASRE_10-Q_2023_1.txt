Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements November 30, 2022 (Unaudited)   NOTE 1 -ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Astra Energy, Inc. (the “Company”, “Astra”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2000.   A Certificate of Amendment was filed on August 22, 2020, with the Nevada Secretary of State changing the name of the Company to Astra Energy, Inc.   The Company is an emerging leader in the acquisition and development of technology in the Waste-to-Energy project sector.   On October 17, 2019, there was an order by the Eight Judicial District Court of Clark County Nevada appointing a Custodian to the Company. The custodianship was discharged on June 18, 2020.   On September 15, 2021, the Company affected a forward stock split of 3 for 1 which was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). All shares throughout these statements reflect the forward split.   On September 21, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Africa - SMC Limited.   On October 12, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Services Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Ssingo Oils and Gas - SMC Limited of Mityana, Uganda.   On November 15, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of California called Astra Energy California, Inc.   On December 22, 2021, the Company incorporated a subsidiary in Tanzania called Astra Energy Tanzania Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Kiluwa Group of Companies Limited of Kinondoni, Tanzania.   On August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
68.2 % interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. (“Regreen”), a California corporation, in exchange for
10,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and an agreement to pay $ 250,000
in cash. Regreen is in the business of converting organic and solid waste material into marketable bio-products utilizing its patented series of equipment and processes.   On August 17, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an additional
8.7 % interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. in exchange for
1,300,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and an agreement to pay $ 400,000
in cash.   On August 17, 2022, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Florida called Astra Holcomb Energy Systems Inc.   On September 19, 2022, the Company acquired a
3.1 % interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. in exchange for
2,750,000
shares of the Company’s common stock.   On October 27, 2022, the Company acquired

5
million shares of the Company’s common stock. Astra-Holcomb Energy Systems LLC holds the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the patented Holcomb Energy System In-Line Power Generator. There are no other assets and no liabilities in Astra-Holcomb Energy Systems LLC.   On November 20, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary, Regreen Technologies Inc. (“Regreen”) entered into a Joint Venture Investment Cooperation Agreement with Viecotech Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese based company. The Joint Venture will manufacture, distribute, and deploy the patented Regreen waste processing system in the Asia Pacific region. Regreen will hold 50% ownership in the Joint Venture. The agreement will be completed upon receipt by Regreen of certain payments from Viecotech.     F-6 Table of Contents   NOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of presentation   The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending August 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Principles of Consolidation   These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) which the Company controls. For accounting purposes, control is established by an investor when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and when it can affect those returns through its power over the entity. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturities for the instruments held. The Company had no cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022.   Stock-based Compensation   We account for equity-based transactions with employees and non-employees under the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) , which establishes that equity-based payments to employees and non-employees are recorded at the grant date the fair value of the equity instruments the entity is obligated to issue when the employees and non-employees have rendered the requisite service and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments. Topic 718 also states that observable market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and, if available, should be used as the basis for the measurement for equity and liability instruments awarded in these share-based payment transactions. However, if observable market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments are not available, the fair value shall be estimated by using a valuation technique or model that complies with the measurement objective, as described in FASB ASC Topic 718.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:   ● Identification of a contract with a customer; ● Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; ● Determination of the transaction price; ● Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and ● Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.   Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.     F-7 Table of Contents   Net income (loss) per common share   Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The following is the calculation as of November 30, 2022 and 2021.       2022     2021   Net Loss   $ ( 1,603,239 )   $ ( 473,692 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted     62,883,727       44,080,540   Net loss per share, basic and diluted   $ ( 0.03 )   $ ( 0.01 )   The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company has
10,667
potentially dilutive shares from Series A preferred stock and
380,698
potentially dilutive shares from the Series D preferred stock. Any potentially dilutive shares have not been included due to their anti-dilutive effect, as the Company as a net loss.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN   As reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 34,126,974
as of November 30, 2022, and no revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   In order to continue as a going concern, the Company is planning to secure its financial capital in various ways. It will finance its operations initially through shareholder loans from the principals and through private placement investment offerings. The Company may decide to finance its project development stage by way of an equity offering by issuing shares or by engaging venture capital firms that invest in early-stage companies. Venture capital firms August do more than just supply money to small new opportunities. They can also provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees.    The company will also look to develop a relationship with a bank or banks with the intention of demonstrating a track record of progress and building value and securing some form of financing in the future. Once Astra Energy Inc. has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm can make a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms have two main methods of borrowing: banks and bonds.   If Astra Energy is earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), the Company can choose to reinvest some of these profits in equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting their own profits is one primary source of financial capital.    Another source of financial capital that will be considered at the project development stage of a specific project is a bond. A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future. A corporate bond is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, a municipal bond is issued by cities, a state bond by U.S. states, and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. A bond specifies an amount that will be borrowed, the interest rate that will be paid, and the time until repayment. Given the nature of the renewable industry regarding long term power purchase agreements or offtake agreements bonds are a very cost effective and reliable method of funding projects.      F-8 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 – PREPAID STOCK FOR ACQUISITION   The prepaid asset of $ 32,856,000
relates to the potential acquisition of Regreen Technologies, Inc. The valuation of this asset is subject to the completion of milestones in the underlying agreements and all parties meeting certain requirements. The amount may be impacted by cancellation of the acquisition and/or inability for parties to meet milestones in future periods. There was no impact to the results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022, as the company has only issued common stock (currently held in escrow) to Regreen for the acquisition. If, upon completion of the acquisition, there has been a material change to the financial condition of Regreen, it may impact the final valuation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.   NOTE 5 – INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY   The investment in subsidiary of $ 2,725,000
relates to the acquisition of

As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean Astra Energy, Inc. and our subsidiaries, Astra Energy Africa - SMC Limited, Astra Energy Services Limited, Astra Energy California, Inc. and Astra Energy Tanzania Limited, unless otherwise indicated.   Corporate Overview   Astra Energy, Inc. (the “Company”, “Astra”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2000.   A Certificate of Amendment was filed on August 22, 2020 with the Nevada Secretary of State changing the name of the Company to Astra Energy, Inc.   The Company is an emerging leader in the acquisition and development of technology in the Waste-to-Energy project sector.   On October 17, 2019, there was an order by the Eight Judicial District Court of Clark County Nevada appointing a Custodian to the Company. The custodianship was discharged on June 18, 2020.   On September 15, 2021, the Company affected a forward stock split of 3 for 1 which was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). All shares throughout these statements reflect the forward split.   On September 21, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Africa - SMC Limited.     3 Table of Contents   On October 12, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Services Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Ssingo Oils and Gas - SMC Limited of Mityana, Uganda.   On November 15, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of California called Astra Energy California, Inc.   On December 22, 2021, the Company incorporated a subsidiary in Tanzania called Astra Energy Tanzania Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Kiluwa Group of Companies Limited of Kinondoni, Tanzania.   On August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 68.2% interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. (“Regreen”), a California corporation, in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and an agreement to pay $250,000 in cash. Regreen is in the business of converting organic and solid waste material into marketable bio-products utilizing its patented series of equipment and processes.   On August 17, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 8.7% interest in Regreen in exchange for 1,300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and an agreement to pay $400,000 in cash.   On August 17, 2022, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Florida called Astra Holcomb Energy Systems Inc.   On September 19, 2022, the Company acquired a 3.1% interest in Regreen in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.   On October 27, 2022, the Company acquired 50% of the outstanding shares of Astra-Holcomb Energy Systems LLC., a Delaware entity, in exchange for 5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Astra-Holcomb Energy Systems LLC holds the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the patented Holcomb Energy System In-Line Power Generator. There are no other assets and no liabilities in Astra-Holcomb Energy Systems LLC.   On November 20, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary, Regreen entered into a Joint Venture Investment Cooperation Agreement with Viecotech Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese based company. The Joint Venture will manufacture, distribute, and deploy the patented Regreen waste processing system in the Asia Pacific region. Regreen will hold 50% ownership in the Joint Venture. The agreement will be completed upon receipt by Regreen of certain payments from Viecotech.   Business Operations   Astra Energy is an emerging company in the waste management industry and the electricity and power generation sectors with a focus on energy production from solar, waste conversion and clean burning fuels. The Company strives to advance clean energy initiatives globally while delivering measurable benefits to communities and value to our investors by investing in and developing renewable and clean energy projects in markets where demand is high and supply is limited.   WASTE CONVERSION :   In August 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Regreen, a California based company with innovative and patented waste conversion technology and equipment. The Regreen Total Waste System converts municipal solid waste, food waste and plant waste raw material into biomass pellets which are then converted to various fuels and end products. In contrast to typical incinerator based WTE systems, the Regreen Total Waste System uses pyrolysis to burn and convert waste. Pyrolysis is an oxygen-absent process that converts dehydrated biomass into flammable liquids and gases under high temperature conditions. The Regreen system works by converting MSW into dried pellets with extremely low moisture content, which are then fed into a pyrolizer. The pyrolizer produces pyro oils (which can be used in generators and engines), carbon black (typically used in rubber manufacturing), and Syngas, which is further processed to yield jet fuel, green diesel, and bitumen (which can be used for asphalt and roofing).   We will specialize in providing sustainable waste and energy solutions and will safely convert millions of tons of waste from municipalities and businesses into valuable clean, renewable biofuels, biodiesel and jet fuel. The Company will provide comprehensive material management services to communities seeking solutions to some of today’s most complex environmental challenges. The systems used in the power facilities will greatly reduce or eliminate methane emissions from landfills, as well as reduce reliance on imported fuels by replacing them with biofuels made from agricultural products. The Company will create a valued intellectual property portfolio by way of securing global licenses for or co-developing technologies that can convert multiple different waste streams into renewable fuel sources more efficiently and at a considerably lower cost.     4 Table of Contents   Recent legislation in California which requires food waste to be composted with the goal to reduce food waste in landfills by 75%. The State is directly in support of this system as a result. SB 1383, establishes methane reduction targets for California. California SB 1383 is a bill that sets goals to reduce disposal of organic waste in landfills, including edible food. The bill’s purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane, and address food insecurity in California. Aspects of this law ensure that food scraps are composted and compost is purchased by cities. Composting, industrial uses, and animal feed are good environmental uses for inedible food or other organic material.  Landfilling organic waste is a significant source of local air quality pollutants, which can cause respiratory issues and hospitalizations for community members. Beyond this, we are seeing the effects of climate change in California with more severe and lengthy droughts, warmer temperatures that contribute to the increasing number of wildfires (also impacting air quality), bigger storms, and coastal erosion due to rising sea levels. To address the environmental and health concerns of surplus edible food, this law requires 20% of edible food that would otherwise be disposed of in the garbage or compost be recovered for human consumption by 2025. This means surplus edible food will help feed Californians in need instead of decomposing in a landfill while emitting harmful greenhouse gases.    In May 2022, Regreen entered into a Letter of Intent to install a One Ton-Per-Hour system at a material recovery facility in California. Completion of the installation is pending California Local Enforcement Agency approval relating to solid waste disposal.   On November 20, 2022, Regreen entered into a Joint Venture Investment Cooperation Agreement with Viecotech Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese based company for the manufacture, distribution, and deployment of the patented Regreen waste processing system in the Asia Pacific region. Regreen will hold 50% ownership in the Joint Venture.
Regreen is currently in negotiations to sell, joint venture and deploy the Regreen system in several countries including India, Panama, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Jamaica, and Ecuador.    Astra Energy is advancing a waste to energy project on the island of Zanzibar to convert 15 tons of municipal solid waste per hour into 10MW/hour of electric power. The project will enable the island to dispose of all its garbage, thereby avoiding the need for a garbage landfill. Landfills are major generators of methane, a major greenhouse gas that is responsible for global warming. There are continuing discussions with the island government.
The preliminary plan is for Astra to develop, operate, and maintain the waste to energy infrastructure. The power will be fed into the island’s grid network pursuant to a power purchase agreement.     5 Table of Contents   SOLAR :   We are currently completing a feasibility study for the supply and installation of a 40 MW solar farm with battery storage on the island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The plan is to secure a power purchase agreement to feed the power into the grid network. The island of Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous territory of Tanzania in the Indian ocean. Electric power to the island is currently provided using two 100MW submarine cables from mainland Tanzania. These cables are now at capacity. The island wishes to have an independent power supply. Therefore, the immediate need for an additional 50MW of power in less than two years. The Company has initiated negotiations with the government of Zanzibar to provide the required power.   POWER GENERATION   In October 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture with Holcomb Scientific Research Ltd. (“HSR”) to manufacture and distribute the innovative and patent protected Holcomb Inline Generator for homes, commercial applications, solar projects, electric vehicles, large power scale power plants, and many more applications.   HSR is a Research and Development company that has created the patent-protected Holcomb Energy System, a scientific breakthrough in clean energy generation. The HES utilizes the natural energy produced by the electron spin in the iron atom, converting it into usable electricity while requiring no fuel, releasing zero carbon emissions, and having no moving parts - therefore running completely silent.   CLEAN ENERGY:   Astra Energy in concert with the government of Tanzania is advancing a 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant project. The government of Tanzania provided a positive response to the expression of interest, and they have requested a technical proposal. Astra is applying for Advocacy support for this project from the US Mission in Tanzania.   The Company is currently in negotiations to acquire an existing 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant (the “Plant”).   Astra is in continuing discussions to secure a gas supply agreement with the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation for the natural gas required to fuel the Plant. Once the agreement is executed, we will begin the process of relocating the Plant to Tanzania. As the Plant is installed, the Company will finalize power purchase agreements and distribution agreements.   Results of Operations   Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended November 30, 2021   Revenues   We had no revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.

Our current capital and our other existing resources will not be sufficient to provide the working capital needed for our current business. Additional capital will be required to meet our debt obligations, and to further expand our business. We may be unable to obtain the additional capital required. Our inability to generate capital or raise additional funds when required will have a negative impact on our business development and financial results.   For the three months ended November 30, 2022, we primarily funded our business operations with $264,500 net proceeds from the sale of common shares. As of November 30, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $196,679, not taking into account the prepaid stock for acquisition.     7 Table of Contents   Cash Flow Activity   For the three months ended November 30, 2022, $456,794 was used by operations, compared to $594,638 used by operations in the prior period.   For the three months ended November 30, 2022, we received $264,500 from the sale of common stock units.   With our current cash balance will be unable to sustain operations for the next twelve months. We need to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. We are a development stage company and have generated limited revenue to date. The future of our Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations.   We estimate that our operating expenses over the next 12 months will be approximately $600,000. This estimate may change significantly depending on the ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources.   We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales and grants of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.   Critical Accounting Policies   Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.   Item 3.

Based on the foregoing, our president and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance in the reliability of our corporate reporting as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report due to certain deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The material weaknesses included weaknesses in procedures for control evaluation, a lack of an audit committee, insufficient documentation of review procedures, and insufficient information technology procedures.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.     8 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
