Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Digipath,
Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 5, 2010. Digipath, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Digipath,” the “Company,”
“we,” “our” or “us”) is a service-oriented independent testing laboratory, data analytics and media
firm focused on the developing cannabis and hemp markets, and supports the cannabis industry’s best practices for reliable testing,
cannabis education and training. Our mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade analysis and testing to the cannabis industry, under
ISO-17025:2017 guidelines, to ensure consumers and patients know exactly what is in the cannabis they ingest and to help maximize the
quality of our clients’ products through research, development, and standardization. Digipath has been operating a cannabis-testing
lab in Nevada since 2015 and hopes to open labs in other states that have legalized the sale of cannabis, beginning with California or
Arizona.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with GAAP and do not contain certain information included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative
of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following entities, all of which were under common control
and ownership at December 31, 2022:

The
consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of the wholly-owned subsidiaries listed above. All significant inter-company
transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of these financial statements. The parent company and subsidiaries will be collectively
referred to herein as the “Company”, “Digipath” or “DIGP”. The Company’s headquarters are located
in Las Vegas, Nevada and substantially all of its customers are within the United States.
7
These
statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for
fair presentation of the information contained therein.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level
valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three
levels are defined as follows:
-
Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
-
Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
-
Level
3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
The
carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payables and accrued expenses are estimated by management to approximate fair value
primarily due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes
revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following
steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction
price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance
obligation is satisfied.
Revenue
is primarily generated through our subsidiary, Digipath Labs, Inc., which recognizes revenue from the analytical testing of cannabis
products for licensed producers and cultivators within the state of Nevada on a determinable fixed fee per test, or panel of tests basis.
Revenue from the performance of those services is recognized upon completion of the tests, at which time test results are delivered to
the customer, provided collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. We typically require payment within thirty days of the delivery
of results. Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of its receivables.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718)
and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 2018-07 (ASC 2018-07). All transactions in which goods or services are the
consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the
equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete or the date at which a
commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached because of sufficiently large disincentives
for nonperformance.
Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share
The
basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, potential
dilutive securities of
91,161,317
and
50,368,696
shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable,
6,020,000
and
6,020,000
shares issuable upon exercise of options,
15,387,050
and
2,535,001
shares issuable upon exercise of warrants, and
13,579,710
and
13,579,710
shares issuable upon conversion of Preferred A and Preferred B shares, respectively, had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included
in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,  Debt -   Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):   Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts
in an Entity’s Own Equity).  ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible
preferred stock, which results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with
current GAAP. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 affects the diluted earnings per share calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash
or shares and for convertible instruments and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts
in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 allows entities to use a modified or full retrospective transition method and is effective
for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had negative working capital
of $ 1,465,347 , accumulated recurring losses of $ 20,249,101 , and only $ 155,832
of cash on hand, which is not sufficient to sustain operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing
new customers to increase revenues. In addition, the Company is currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short term operations.
Management believes these factors will contribute toward achieving profitability.
The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company discloses the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820 –
Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC
820”). Under FASB ASC 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation
framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the
related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures
that are required for items measured at fair value.
The
Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The following schedule summarizes
the valuation of financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, respectively:

interest at an annual rate of
10 %, are evidenced by secured demand notes, and are secured by a lien on the borrower’s assets. An
allowance for doubtful accounts for the full value of the notes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of collectability.
On
various dates between August 23, 2021 and September 30, 2022, we loaned C3 Labs, Inc. (“C3 Labs”) a total of $ 1,047,649 .
The loans bore interest at an annual rate of
8 %. These loans were evidenced by secured demand notes, and were secured by a lien on the
borrower’s assets and have a maturity date of
August 23, 2022 . The Company had recorded total accrued interest of $ 64,017
as of
September 30, 2022.
The
loans were made in connection with a potential acquisition of a controlling interest in C3 Labs pursuant to a letter of intent. On March
11, 2022, the Company notified the current owners of C3 Labs of its termination of the letter of intent and took possession of the equipment
of C3 Labs (“C3 Equipment”), which it is in the process of being liquidated.
On
December 8, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Invictus Wealth Group (“Invictus”), whereby the
Company agreed to sell the C3 Equipment to Invictus for a total purchase price of $ 900,000 . The purchase price consisted of an upfront
payment of $ 275,000 , and a Note Receivable (“Invictus Note”) in the amount of $ 625,000 . The Invictus Note has a maturity
date of
December 31, 2023 , accrues interest at a rate of

due on December 31, 2023. The Company has recorded a full allowance
against the Invictus Note as collectability cannot be assured as of the date of this filing. As of December 31, 2022 and through the
date of this filing, the Company has received $ 100,000
of the initial $ 275,000 , and as a result the Company will continue to maintain
possession of the C3 Equipment until the remainder of the upfront payment has been received.

Leases
The
Company leases its operating and office facility under a non-cancelable real property lease agreement that expires on
August 31, 2025 .
The Company also has a financing lease for lab equipment subject to the recently adopted ASU 2016-02. In the locations in which it is
economically feasible to continue to operate, management expects to enter into a new lease upon expiration. The real property lease contains
provisions requiring payment of property taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and other occupancy costs applicable to the leased
premise. As the Company’s leases do not provide implicit discount rates, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on
the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

addition, the Company recognized and measured the embedded beneficial conversion feature present in the convertible notes by allocating
a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of the feature to additional paid-in-capital. The intrinsic value of the feature
was calculated on the commitment date using the effective conversion price of the convertible notes. This intrinsic value is limited
to the portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt.
The
aforementioned accounting treatment resulted in a total debt discount equal to of $ 93,938

debt discount in the amounts of $ 48,916

and is currently
convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 0.04 . The conversion price of the Series B Preferred is subject to equitable
adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the common stock, and in the event of the issuance
of common stock by the Company below the conversion price, subject to customary exceptions. At the current conversion price, the
333,600
shares of Series B Preferred outstanding at December 31, 2022 are convertible into
8,340,000
shares of the common stock of the Company.
No holder is permitted to convert its shares of Series B Preferred if such conversion would cause the holder to beneficially own more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company immediately after such conversion, unless waived by such holder by providing at least sixty-five days’ notice .
16
Additional
terms of the Series B Preferred and include the following:
●

may then be converted.
●

the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or upon a change
in control whereby a stockholder gains control of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the shares of Series B Preferred
are entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock, 100% of the purchase price per share of Series
B Preferred plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.
●
Each
share of Series B Preferred carries a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such Series B Preferred
may then be converted.
Due
to the change in control provision of the Series B Preferred, the Series B Preferred is classified as temporary equity on the balance
sheet.

common stock on all matters presented to the holders of common stock, whether at a special or annual meeting, by written action in lieu
of a meeting or otherwise, on the basis of 200,000 votes for each share of Series C Preferred Stock . The shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are not convertible into common stock, are not entitled to dividends, are not subject to redemption, and have a stated value of
$ 0.10
per share payable on any liquidation of the Company in preference to any payment payable to the holders of common stock.

Revenues
Aggregate
revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $726,775, compared to revenues of $699,585 during the three months ended December
31, 2021, an increase of $27,170 or 4%. The increase in revenue was due to the increase in tourism in Nevada during the current period
and our customers’ improved cash flows, in comparison to the prior year period.
Cost
of Sales
Cost
of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $422,835, compared to $422,601 during the three months ended December 31,
2021, an increase of $234. Cost of sales consists primarily of labor, depreciation, maintenance on lab equipment, and supplies
consumed in our testing operations. Our gross margins were approximately 42% during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 40% during the three
months ended December 31, 2021, which translated to $26,936 of increased gross profit. Our margins increased in the current period due
to the increase in revenues.
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $306,483, compared to $240,964 during the three months
ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $65,519, or 27%. The expenses consisted primarily of marketing, rent, salaries and wages, and
travel expenses. General and administrative expenses included non-cash, stock-based compensation of $0 during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased corporate overhead
activities and increased audit fees from Nevada’s Cannabis Control Board.
Professional
Fees
Professional
fees for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $69,969, compared to $255,749 during the three months ended December 31, 2021,
a decrease of $185,780, or 73%. Professional fees included non-cash, stock-based compensation of $8,603 and $33,457 during the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Professional fees decreased primarily due to decreased corporate consulting services
during the current period as we decreased our focus on expansion efforts.
Change
in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Our
change in allowance for doubtful accounts for the three months ended December 31, 2022 resulted in $13,685 of expense, compared to $2,139
of income during the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decline of $15,824, or 740%. Our change in allowance for doubtful accounts
declined during the current period primarily as our allowance for doubtful accounts increased from $139,279 to $155,141 during the quarter.
Operating
Loss
Our
operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $86,217, compared to an operating loss of $217,590 during the three
months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $131,373, or 60%. Our operating loss decreased primarily due to our decreased professional
fees.
Other
Income (Expense)
Other
expense, on a net basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $154,113, compared to other expense, on a net basis, of
$60,013 during the three months ended December 31, 2021, a net increase of $94,100. Other expense consisted of interest expense of
$99,113 and an impairment on equipment of $55,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $17,234, compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $177,158 for the same period ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily
attributable to our decrease in net loss and accounts receivable, along with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was $97,334, compared to $408,482 used in investing
activities for the same period ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided by investing activities in the current period was a result
of the sale of the collateralized assets from the note receivable compared to cash used in investing activities for the prior period
which was a result of loans we made in connection with a potential acquisition.
Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $14,904, compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $380,013 for the same period ended December 31, 2021. The current period consisted of $14,904 of principal payments on an
equipment loan, compared to $400,000 of proceeds received on debt financing, proceeds of $55,600 from the sale of preferred stock, as
offset by $8,467 of principal payments on an equipment lease and $14,142 of principal payments on an equipment loan and $52,978 of principal
payments made on convertible notes in the comparative period in the prior year.
Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern
As
of December 31, 2022, our balance of cash on hand was $155,832, and we had negative working capital of $1,465,346 and an accumulated
deficit of $20,249,101 resulting from recurring losses. We currently may not have sufficient funds to sustain our operations for the
next twelve months and we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations and expand our lab testing business. As we continue
to develop our lab testing business and attempt to expand operational activities, we expect to experience net negative cash flows from
operations in amounts not now determinable, and will be required to obtain additional financing to fund operations through common stock
offerings to the extent necessary to provide working capital. We have and expect to continue to have substantial capital expenditure
and working capital needs.
The
Company has incurred recurring losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit, and, as set forth above, the Company’s
cash on hand is not sufficient to sustain operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing new customers to increase revenues. In addition, the Company is currently seeking
additional sources of capital to fund short term operations. In the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management
would seek additional financing or would attempt to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in achieving these objectives, becoming profitable or continuing our business without either a temporary interruption or
a permanent cessation. In addition, additional financing may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in
trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
21
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of
commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our
financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management’s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of
their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly
from management’s current judgments.
While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating
our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we used in the preparation of our financial
statements.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes
revenue from the sale of lab testing services through our subsidiary Digipath Labs, Inc.
Revenue
is primarily generated through our subsidiary, Digipath Labs, Inc., which recognizes revenue from the analytical testing of cannabis
products for licensed producers and cultivators within the state of Nevada on a determinable fixed fee per test, or panel of tests basis.
Revenue from the performance of those services is recognized upon completion of the tests, at which time test results are delivered to
the customer, provided collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. We typically require payment within thirty days of the delivery
of results. Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of its receivables.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718)
and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 2018-07 (ASC 2018-07). All transactions in which the consideration provided
in exchange for the purchase of goods or services consists of the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement
date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete
or the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached because of sufficiently
large disincentives for nonperformance.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) or in other factors that occurred during the period of our evaluation or subsequent to the date we carried out our
evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
There can be no assurance that any system of controls and procedures will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote.
