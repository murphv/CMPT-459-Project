However, all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”).  The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. (b)   Principles of Consolidation:  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Timberland Service Corporation.   All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. (c)   Operating Segment:  The Company has
one
reportable operating segment which is defined as community banking in western Washington under the operating name, "Timberland Bank." (d)   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. (e)   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2022 presentation with no change to previously reported net income or total shareholders’ equity. 11 (2)

Total $ 25,170   $ ( 292 ) 16   $ 15,705   $ ( 602 ) 13   $ 40,875   $ ( 894 ) 13 The Company has evaluated the investment securities in the above tables and has determined that the declines in their fair value are temporary.  The unrealized losses are primarily due to changes in market interest rates and spreads in the market for mortgage-related products.
The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates and/or as the pricing spreads narrow on mortgage-related securities.  The Company has the ability and the intent to hold the investments until the fair value recovers.  Further, as of December 31, 2022, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale for which the estimated fair value is below the recorded value and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such securities before a recovery of cost (or recorded value if previously written down). The Company bifurcates OTTI into (1) amounts related to credit losses which are recognized through earnings and (2) amounts related to all other factors which are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). To determine the component of the gross OTTI related to credit losses, the Company compared the amortized cost basis of the OTTI security to the present value of its revised expected cash flows, discounted using its pre-impairment yield.  The revised expected cash flow estimates for individual securities are based primarily on an analysis of default rates, prepayment speeds and third-party analytic reports.  Significant judgment by management is required in this analysis that includes, but is not limited to, assumptions regarding the collectability of principal and interest, net of related expenses, on the underlying loans.   The following table presents a summary of the significant inputs utilized to measure management’s estimates of the credit loss component on OTTI securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:   Range Weighted Minimum  Maximum  Average  December 31, 2022       Constant prepayment rate 6.00   % 15.00   % 8.87   % Collateral default rate —   % 14.64   % 9.06   % Loss severity rate —   % 7.76   % 2.94   % December 31, 2021       Constant prepayment rate 6.00   % 15.00   % 12.50   % Collateral default rate 1.56   % 22.67   % 12.14   % Loss severity rate —   % 13.95   % 3.30   %
The following table presents a roll forward of the credit loss component of held to maturity and available for sale debt securities that have been written down for OTTI with the credit loss component recognized in earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):   Three Months Ended

GOODWILL AND CDI Goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid in a business combination exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is analyzed annually for impairment.  The Company performs an annual review during the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired.
For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the services offered through the Bank and its subsidiary are managed as one strategic unit and represent the Company's only reporting unit. The annual goodwill impairment test begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is "more likely than not" that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
If an entity concludes that it is not "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform a two-step impairment test.
If the Company's qualitative assessment concluded that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it must perform the two-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any.
The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, or the book value, including goodwill.
If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit equals or exceeds its book value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized.
The reporting unit must determine fair value for all assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill.
The net of the assigned fair value of assets and liabilities is then compared to the book value of the reporting unit, and any excess book value becomes the implied fair value of goodwill.
If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the newly calculated implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount required to write-down the goodwill to the implied fair value. Management's qualitative assessment takes into consideration macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost or margin factors, financial performance and share price of the Company's common stock.
The Company performed its fiscal year 2022 goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended June 30, 2022.
Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it is not "more likely than not" that the Company's fair value is less than its carrying amount, and, therefore, goodwill was determined not to be impaired at May 31, 2022. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of goodwill impairment has occurred.
Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the
15 Company's stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse assessment or action by a regulator; and unanticipated competition.
Any change in these indicators could have a significant negative impact on the Company's financial condition, impact the goodwill impairment analysis or cause the Company to perform a goodwill impairment analysis more frequently than once per year. As of December 31, 2022, management believes that there have been no events or changes in the circumstances since May 31, 2022 that would indicate a potential impairment of goodwill.
No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future.
If adverse economic conditions or any decreases in the Company's stock price and market capitalization were deemed other than temporary, it may significantly affect the fair value of the Company's goodwill and may trigger impairment charges.
Any impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
The recorded amount of goodwill at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 remained unchanged at $ 15.13
million. CDI represents the future economic benefit of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of a business combination compared to the cost of alternative funding sources.
CDI is amortized to non-interest expense using an accelerated method based on an estimated runoff of related deposits over a period of ten years.
CDI is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any changes in estimated useful life accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining life.
As of December 31, 2022, management believes that there have been no events or changes in the circumstances that would indicate a potential impairment of CDI.

Watch:   Watch loans are defined as those loans that still exhibit acceptable quality, but have some concerns that justify greater attention.  If these concerns are not corrected, a potential for further adverse categorization exists.  These concerns could relate to a specific condition peculiar to the borrower, its industry segment or the general economic environment. Special Mention:
Special mention loans are defined as those loans deemed by management to have some potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the payment prospects of the loan.  Substandard:   Substandard loans are defined as those loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged.  Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt.  If the weakness or weaknesses are not corrected, there is the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained. Doubtful:
Loans in this classification have the weaknesses of substandard loans with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make the collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there were no loans classified as doubtful. Loss:   Loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.  This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be realized in the future.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there were no loans classified as loss. 21 The following tables present an analysis of loans by credit quality indicator and portfolio segment at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Loan Grades   December 31, 2022 Pass Watch Special Mention Substandard Total Mortgage loans:           One- to four-family $ 199,864   $ 36   $ —   $ 385   $ 200,285   Multi-family 96,831   —   —   —   96,831   Commercial 528,906   7,925   233   5,507   542,571   Construction – custom and owner/builder 64,708   2,132   —   —   66,840   Construction – speculative one- to four-family 8,032   —   —   —   8,032   Construction – commercial 27,432   —   —   —   27,432   Construction – multi-family 44,374   —   —   —   44,374   Construction – land development 12,896   —   —   22   12,918   Land 24,932   515   —   425   25,872   Consumer loans:         Home equity and second mortgage 35,465   32   —   470   35,967   Other 2,419   61   —   2   2,482   Commercial business loans 126,764   —   —   321   127,085   SBA PPP loans 631   —   —   —   631   Total $ 1,173,254   $ 10,701   $ 233   $ 7,132   $ 1,191,320   September 30, 2022           Mortgage loans:         One- to four-family $ 175,687   $ 38   $ —   $ 391   $ 176,116   Multi-family 95,025   —   —   —   95,025   Commercial 522,741   7,940   237   5,732   536,650   Construction – custom and owner/builder 65,249   1,842   —   —   67,091   Construction – speculative one- to four-family 8,364   —   —   —   8,364   Construction – commercial 29,059   —   —   —   29,059   Construction – multi-family 34,354   —   —   —   34,354   Construction – land development 13,557   —   —   25   13,582   Land 25,882   522   —   450   26,854   Consumer loans:         Home equity and second mortgage 34,709   19   —   459   35,187   Other 2,063   62   —   3   2,128   Commercial business loans 124,712   —   —   327   125,039   SBA PPP loans 1,001   —   —   —   1,001   Total $ 1,132,403   $ 10,423   $ 237   $ 7,387   $ 1,150,450   Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts (principal and interest) when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, may be collectively evaluated for impairment. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured by using discounted cash flows, except when, as an alternative, the current estimated fair value of the collateral (reduced by estimated costs to sell, if applicable) or observable market price is used. The valuation of real estate collateral is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in future periods because of changes in economic conditions.  Management considers third-party appraisals, as well as independent fair market value assessments from realtors or persons involved in selling real estate, in determining the estimated fair value of particular properties.  In addition, as certain of these third-party appraisals and independent fair market value assessments are only updated periodically, changes in the values of specific properties may have occurred subsequent to the most recent appraisals.  Accordingly, the amounts of any such potential changes and any related adjustments are generally recorded at the time that such information is received. When the estimated net realizable value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest and net deferred loan origination fees or costs), impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses, and uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the principal balance. The categories of non-accrual loans and impaired loans overlap, although they are not identical.   22 The following table is a summary of information related to impaired loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2022 and for the three months then ended (dollars in thousands): Recorded Investment Unpaid Principal Balance (Loan Balance Plus Charge Off) Related Allowance Year to Date ("YTD") Average Recorded Investment (1) YTD Interest Income Recognized (1) YTD Cash Basis Interest Income Recognized (1) With no related allowance recorded:       Mortgage loans:       One- to four-family $ 383   $ 427   $ —  $ 386   $ 7   $ 7   Commercial 2,980   2,980   —  2,984   33   42   Land 425   425   —  438   —   —   Consumer loans:   Home equity and second mortgage 405   405   —  400   2   3   Other 2   2   —  3   —   —   Commercial business loans 55   103   —  57   —   —   Subtotal 4,250   4,342   —  4,268   42   52   With an allowance recorded:       Commercial business loans 249   249   127   249   —   —   Subtotal 249   249   127   249   —   —   Total:       Mortgage loans:       One- to four-family 383   427   —   386   7   7   Commercial 2,980   2,980   —   2,984   33   42   Land 425   425   —   438   —   —   Consumer loans: Home equity and second mortgage 405   405   —   400   2   3   Other 2   2   —   3   —   —   Commercial business loans 304   352   127   306   —   —   Total $ 4,499   $ 4,591   $ 127   $ 4,517   $ 42   $ 52   ______________________________________________ (1) For the three months ended December 31, 2022 . 23 The following table is a summary of information related to impaired loans by portfolio segment as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Recorded Investment Unpaid Principal Balance (Loan Balance Plus Charge Off) Related Allowance YTD Average Recorded Investment (1) YTD Interest Income Recognized (1) YTD Cash Basis Interest Income Recognized (1) With no related allowance recorded:             Mortgage loans:             One- to four-family $ 388   $ 432   $ —  $ 470   $ 31   $ 31   Commercial 2,988   2,988   —  3,041   152   123   Land 450   450   —  492   —   —   Consumer loans:             Home equity and second mortgage 394   394   —  436   6   5   Other 3   3   —  7   —   —   Commercial business loans 59   108   —  121   —   —   Subtotal 4,282   4,375   —  4,567   189   159   With an allowance recorded:             Consumer loans:             Home equity and second mortgage —   —   —   145   —   —   Commercial business loans 250   250   127   268   —   —   Subtotal 250   250   127   413   —   —   Total             Mortgage loans:             One- to four-family 388   432   —   470   31   31   Commercial 2,988   2,988   —   3,041   152   123   Land 450   450   —   492   —   —   Consumer loans:             Home equity and second mortgage 394   394   —   581   6   5   Other 3   3   —   7   —   —   Commercial business loans 309   358   127   389   —   —   Total $ 4,532   $ 4,625   $ 127   $ 4,980   $ 189   $ 159   _____________________________________________ (1)
For the year ended September 30, 2022. A troubled debt restructured loan ("TDR") is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider.  Examples of such concessions include, but are not limited to: a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity at an interest rate below current market rates; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or re-amortizations, extensions, deferrals and renewals.  TDRs are considered impaired and are individually evaluated for impairment.  TDRs are classified as non-accrual (and considered to be non-performing) unless they have been performing in accordance with modified terms for a period of at least six months.
The Company had $ 2.58
million and $ 2.62
million in TDRs included in impaired loans at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, and had
no
commitments at these dates to lend additional funds on these loans.  There was
no
allowance for loan losses allocated to TDRs at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
There were no TDRs for which there was a payment default within the first 12 months of the modification during the three months ended December 31, 2022. 24 The following tables set forth information with respect to the Company’s TDRs by interest accrual status as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands):   December 31, 2022   Accruing Non- Accrual Total Mortgage loans:       Commercial $ 2,322   $ —   $ 2,322   Land —   63   63   Consumer loans:          Home equity and second mortgage 141   53   194   Total $ 2,463   $ 116   $ 2,579     September 30, 2022   Accruing Non- Accrual Total Mortgage loans:       Commercial $ 2,330   $ —   $ 2,330   Land —   88   88   Consumer loans:          Home equity and second mortgage 142   55   197   Total $ 2,472   $ 143   $ 2,615   There were no new TDRs recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022.

LEASES At December 31, 2022, the Company has operating leases for two retail bank branch offices.
The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of
four
to
nine years , both of which include options to extend the leases for up to
five years . Lease extensions are not certain, and the Company evaluates each lease based on the specific circumstances for the location to determine the probability of exercising the extensions in the calculation of ROU assets and liabilities. The components of lease cost (included in the premises and equipment expense category in the consolidated statements of income) are as follows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Lease cost: 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 88 $ 94 Short-term lease cost — — Total lease cost $ 88   $ 94   25 The following tables provide supplemental information related to operating leases at or for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and year ended September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): At or For the

As an alternative, the weighted average discount rate used to estimate the present value of future lease payments in calculating the value of the ROU asset and liability was determined by utilizing the FHLB fixed-rate credit advance borrowing rate for the term correlating to the remaining term of each lease. Maturities of operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2022 for future fiscal years are as follows (dollars in thousands): Remainder of 2023 $ 233   2024 313   2025 317   2026 284   2027 219   Thereafter 819   Total lease payments 2,185   Less imputed interest 184   Total $ 2,001   (6)
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period without considering any dilutive items.  Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents for items that are dilutive, net of shares assumed to be repurchased using the treasury stock method at the average share price for the Company’s common stock during the period.  Common stock equivalents arise from the assumed conversion of outstanding stock options to purchase common stock.
Information regarding the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 26   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Basic net income per common share computation Numerator – net income

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined under GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
GAAP requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels.
Based on the underlying inputs, each fair value measurement in its entirety is reported in one of three levels.
These levels are: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale and investments in equity securities.
The estimated fair values of MBS are based upon market prices of similar securities or observable inputs (Level 2).
The estimated fair values of mutual funds are based upon quoted market prices (Level 1). 29 The Company had no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
The Company's assets measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2022 Estimated Fair Value     Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available for sale investment securities            MBS: U.S. government agencies $ —   $ 55,841   $ —   $ 55,841   Investments in equity securities    Mutual funds 837   —   —   837   Total $ 837   $ 55,841   $ —   $ 56,678   September 30, 2022 Estimated Fair Value     Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available for sale investment securities            MBS: U.S. government agencies $ —   $ 41,415   $ —   $ 41,415   Investments in equity securities    Mutual funds 835   —   —   835   Total $ 835   $ 41,415   $ —   $ 42,250   There were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. The Company uses the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value on a non-recurring basis: Impaired Loans : The estimated fair value of impaired loans is calculated using the collateral value method or on a discounted cash flow basis.  The specific reserve for collateral dependent impaired loans is based on the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if applicable.  In some cases, adjustments are made to the appraised values due to various factors including age of the appraisal, age of the comparable collateral included in the appraisal and known changes in the market and in the underlying collateral. Such adjustments may be significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 30 The following table summarizes the balances of assets measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):   Estimated Fair Value   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Impaired loans:         Commercial business loans $ —   $ —   $ 122   Total $ —   $ —   $ 122   The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):    Estimated Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input(s) Impaired loans $ 122   Market approach Appraised value less estimated selling costs The following table summarizes the balances of assets measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands):   Estimated Fair Value   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Impaired loans:         Commercial business loans $ —   $ —   $ 123   Total $ —   $ —   $ 123   The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands):    Estimated Fair Value  Valuation Technique(s)  Unobservable Input(s) Impaired loans $ 123   Market approach Appraised value less estimated selling costs GAAP requires disclosure of estimated fair values for certain financial instruments.
Such estimates are subjective in nature, and significant judgment is required regarding the risk characteristics of various financial instruments at a discrete point in time.
Therefore, such estimates could vary significantly if assumptions regarding uncertain factors were to change.
In addition, as the Company normally intends to hold the majority of its financial instruments until maturity, it does not expect to realize many of the estimated amounts disclosed.
The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for certain items which are not defined as financial instruments but for which may have significant value.
The Company does not believe that it would be practicable to estimate a representative fair value for these types of items as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Because GAAP excludes certain items from fair value disclosure requirements, any aggregation of the fair value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value of the Company.
Additionally, in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses the exit price notion in calculating the fair values of financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 31 The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands):   December 31, 2022     Fair Value Measurements Using:   Recorded Amount  Estimated

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , as amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred losses methodology with a current expected losses methodology with respect to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held to maturity investment securities and off-balance sheet commitments. In addition, ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses relating to available for sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction of the carrying amount.
ASU 2016-13 also changes the accounting for PCI debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 retains many of the current disclosure requirements in GAAP and expands certain disclosure requirements. As a
32 "smaller reporting company" filer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Upon adoption, the Company expects a change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance for loan losses, including changes in the assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. In addition, the current policy for OTTI on investment securities available for sale will be replaced with an allowance approach. The Company is reviewing the requirements of ASU 2016-13 and has begun developing and implementing processes and procedures to help ensure that it is fully compliant with ASU 2016-13 at the adoption date.
At this time, the Company anticipates that the allowance for loan losses will increase as a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-13; however, until its evaluation is complete, the magnitude of this increase will be unknown. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity has to perform procedures to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) at the impairment testing date following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity would then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity would consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption ASU 2017-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's future consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.
This ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or other rate references expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.
The ASU permits an entity to make necessary modifications to eligible contracts or transactions without requiring contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination.
This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company has not adopted ASU 2020-04 as of December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's future consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.
The amendments eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for creditors, require new disclosures for creditors for certain loan refinancings and restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and require public business entities to include current-period gross write-offs in the vintage disclosure tables. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's future consolidated financial statements. (11)
REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (" ASC 606') applies to all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, except for contracts that are specifically excluded from its scope.
The majority of the Company's revenues are composed of interest income, deferred loan fee accretion, premium/discount accretion, gains on sales of loans and investments, BOLI net earnings, servicing income on loans sold and other loan fee income, which are not within the scope of ASC 606.
Revenue reported as service charges on deposits, ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, merchant services fees, non-deposit investment fees and escrow fees are within the scope of ASC 606.
All of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 60 6 is recognized in non-interest income with the exception of gains on sales of OREO and gains on sales/disposition of premises and equipment, which are included in non-interest expense.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 947,000
in service charges on deposits, $ 1.25
million in ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, $ 30,000
in escrow fees, and $ 30,000
in fee income from non-deposit investment sales, all considered within the scope of ASC 606. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $ 913,000
in service charges on deposits, $ 1.28  million in ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, $ 78,000
in escrow fees, and $ 2,000
in fee income from non-deposit investment sales, all considered within the scope of ASC 606.
33 If a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligation. Descriptions of the Company's revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC 606 are as follows: • Service Charges on Deposits:
The Company earns fees from its deposit customers from a variety of deposit products and services. Non-transaction based fees such as account maintenance fees and monthly statement fees are considered to be provided to the customer under a day-to-day contract with ongoing renewals.
Revenue for these non-transaction fees are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation.
Transaction-based fees such as non-sufficient fund charges, stop payment charges and wire fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, as the contract duration does not extend beyond the service performed. • ATM and Debit Card Interchange Transaction Fees:
The Company earns fees from cardholder transactions conducted through third-party payment network providers which consist of interchange fees earned from the payment networks as a debit card issuer.
These fees are recognized when the transaction occurs, but may settle on a daily or monthly basis. • Escrow Fees:
The Company earns fees from real estate
escrow contracts with customers. The Company receives and disburses money and/or property according to the customer's contract.
Fees are recognized when the escrow contract closes. • Fee Income from Non-deposit Investment Sales:
The Company earns fees from contracts with customers for investment activities.
Revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis and are generally based on a percentage of the customer's assets under management or based on investment solutions that are implemented for the customer. (12)
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES In the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit - worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the party.  However, such loan to value ratios will subsequently change, based on increases and decreases in the supporting collateral values. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate, land and income-producing commercial properties. A summary of the Company's commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are listed below (in thousands): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Undisbursed portion of construction loans in process (see Note 4) $ 112,096   $ 106,009   Undisbursed lines of credit 133,932   129,456   Commitments to extend credit 14,126   14,205   $ 260,154   $ 249,670   The Company maintains a separate reserve for losses related to unfunded loan commitments.  Management estimates the amount of probable losses related to unfunded loan commitments by applying the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss methodology to an estimate of the expected amount of funding and applies this adjusted factor to the unused portion of unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments totaled $ 320,000
and $ 362,000
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are included in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Increases (decreases) in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments are recorded in non-interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 34 The Bank has an employee severance compensation plan which expires in 2027 and which provides severance pay benefits to eligible employees in the event of a change in control of Timberland Bancorp or the Bank (as defined in the plan).  In general, all employees with
two
or more years of service will be eligible to participate in the plan.  Under the plan, in the event of a change in control of Timberland Bancorp or the Bank, eligible employees who are terminated or who terminate employment (but only upon the occurrence of events specified in the plan) within
12
months of the effective date of a change in control would be entitled to a payment based on years of service or officer rank with the Bank.  The maximum payment for any eligible employee would be equal to
18
months of the employee’s current compensation. Timberland Bancorp has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees, which provide for contingent payment subject to future events. Because of the nature of its activities, the Company is subject to various pending and threatened legal actions which arise in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, liabilities arising from these claims, if any, will not have a material effect on the future consolidated financial position of the Company.

Overview Timberland Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the holding company for Timberland Bank.
The Bank opened for business in 1915 and serves consumers and businesses across Grays Harbor, Thurston, Pierce, King, Kitsap and Lewis counties, Washington with a full range of lending and deposit services through its 23 offices (including its main office in Hoquiam).
At December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets of $1.84 billion, net loans receivable of $1.17 billion, total deposits of $1.60 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $223.55 million.  The Company's business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in the Bank.
Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank's operations. The Bank is a community-oriented bank which has traditionally offered a variety of savings products to its retail and business customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate secured loans.
Lending activities have been focused primarily on the origination of loans secured by real estate, including residential construction loans, one- to four-family residential loans, multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans.
The Bank also originates commercial business loans and other consumer loans. The profitability of the Company’s operations depends primarily on its net interest income after provision for (recapture of) loan losses.  Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that the Company earns on interest-earning assets, which are primarily loans and investments, and interest expense, the amount that the Company pays on its interest-bearing liabilities, which are primarily deposits and borrowings (as needed).  Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets, the interest earned on those assets, the volume and mix of interest- 36 bearing liabilities and the interest paid on those interest-bearing liabilities. Management attempts to maintain a net interest margin placing it within the top quartile of its Washington State peers. Changes in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest we earn on interest earning assets or pay on interest bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest earning assets, interest bearing and non-interest bearing liabilities and shareholders’ equity, usually have the largest impact on changes in our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income during a reporting period. Since March 2022, in response to inflation, the FOMC of the Federal Reserve has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 425 basis points, including 125 basis points during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% as of December 31, 2022.
As it seeks to control inflation without creating a recession, the FOMC has indicated further increases are expected during calendar 2023.
The provision for (recapture of) loan losses is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio as well as prevailing economic and market conditions.  The allowance for loan losses reflects the amount that the Company believes is adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio.
The Company
recorded a $525,000 provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to loan portfolio growth. There was no provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net income is also affected by non-interest income and non-interest expense.  For the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-interest income consisted primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, gain on sales of loans, ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, an increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI, servicing income on loans sold and other operating income.  Non-interest income is also increased by net recoveries on investment securities and reduced by net OTTI losses on investment securities, if any.  Non-interest income is also decreased by valuation allowances on loan servicing rights and increased by recoveries of valuation allowances on loan servicing rights, if any.  Non-interest expense consisted primarily of salaries and employee benefits, premises and equipment, advertising, ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, OREO and other repossessed asset expenses, postage and courier expenses, state and local taxes, professional fees, FDIC insurance premiums, loan administration and foreclosure expenses, data processing and telecommunication expenses, deposit operation expenses, amortization of CDI, and other non-interest expenses.  Non-interest expense in certain periods is reduced by gains on the sale of premises and equipment and gains on the sale of OREO.
Non-interest income and non-interest expense are affected by the growth of the Company's operations and growth in the number of loan and deposit accounts. Results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company has identified several accounting policies that as a result of judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” That discussion highlights estimates that the Company makes that involve uncertainty or potential for substantial change. There have been no material changes in the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 The Company’s total assets decreased by $24.96 million, or 1.3%, to $1.84 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.86 billion at September 30, 2022.  The decrease in total assets was primarily due to a decrease in total cash and cash equivalents, which was partially offset by increases in loans receivable and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were also used to fund the decrease in total deposits. Net loans receivable increased by $40.13 million, or 3.5%, to $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.13 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases in one- to four-family loans, multi-family construction loans, commercial real estate loans
and smaller increases in several other loan categories.
These increases to net loans receivable were partially offset by an increase in the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process, and smaller decreases in several other loan categories.   37 Total deposits decreased by $31.09 million, or 1.9%, to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.63 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to decreases in non-interest bearing account balances, NOW checking account balances, money market account balances, and savings account balances.
These increases were partially offset by increases in certificates of deposit account balances.
Shareholders’ equity increased by $4.98 million, or 2.3%, to $223.55 million at December 31, 2022 from $218.57 million at September 30, 2022.  The increase in shareholders' equity was due to net income and proceeds from stock options exercised and was partially offset by the payment of dividends to common shareholders and the repurchase of common stock.
A more detailed explanation of the changes in significant balance sheet categories follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and CDs Held for Investment:
Cash and cash equivalents and CDs held for investment decreased by $91.36 million, or 26.9%, to $248.29 million at December 31, 2022 from $339.65 million at September 30, 2022.
The decrease was primarily a result of deploying overnight liquidity into higher-earning loan originations and investment securities, as well as to fund deposit withdrawals. Investment Securities:   Investment securities (including investments in equity securities) increased by $26.41 million, or 8.6%, to $335.26 million at December 31, 2022 from $308.86 million at September 30, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to the purchase of additional
U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed investment securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as the Company placed a portion of its excess overnight liquidity into higher-earning investment securities during the period. These increases were partially offset by maturities, prepayments and scheduled amortization of other investment securities.
For additional information on investment securities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 1, Financial Statements.” FHLB Stock :
FHLB stock was $2.19 million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. Other Investments:
Other investments consist solely of the Company's investment in the Solomon Hess SBA Loan Fund LLC, which was unchanged at $3.00 million at both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
This investment is utilized to help satisfy compliance with the Bank's Community Reinvestment Act investment test requirements. Loans:
Net loans receivable increased by $40.13 million, or 3.5%, to $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.13 billion at September 30, 2022.  The increase was primarily due to a $24.17 million increase in one- to four- family loans, a $24.56 million increase in multi-family construction loans, a $5.92 million increase in commercial real estate loans and smaller increases in other categories. These increases were partially offset by a $8.93 million increase in the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process, and smaller decreases in several other categories.
Loan originations decreased by $74.93 million, or 42.4%, to $101.67 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $176.60 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The decrease in loan originations was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of commercial real estate and one- to four-family loans originated.
The decrease was partially offset by increases in multi-family loan originations.
The Company generally sells longer-term fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans for asset liability management purposes and to generate non-interest income.
Sales of fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans decreased by $21.4 million, or 94.9%, to $1.16 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $22.56 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreased refinance activity for one- to four-family loans due to rising interest rates, declining homes sales and a decision to keep more single family loans originated during the quarter in the portfolio. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 1, Financial Statements.” Premises and Equipment:   Premises and equipment decreased by $195,000, or 0.9%, to $21.70 million at December 31, 2022 from $21.90 million at September 30, 2022.  This decrease was primarily due to scheduled depreciation. OREO (Other Real Estate Owned): .  At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, total OREO and other repossessed assets consisted of two land parcels with no recorded value.
38 BOLI (Bank Owned Life Insurance):
BOLI increased by $156,000 or 0.7%, to $22.96 million at December 31, 2022 from $22.81 million at September 30, 2022.
The increase was due to net BOLI earnings, representing the increase in the cash surrender value of the BOLI policies.
Goodwill and CDI:   The recorded amount of goodwill remained unchanged at $15.13 million at both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
CDI decreased by $68,000, or 7.2%, to $880,000 million at December 31, 2022 from $948,000 at September 30, 2022 due to scheduled amortization. For additional information on goodwill and CDI, see Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 1, Financial Statements.” Loan Servicing Rights, Net :
Loan servicing rights, net decreased by $253,000, or 8.4%, to $2.77 million at December 31, 2022 from $3.02 million at September 30, 2022, primarily due to the amortization of servicing rights.
The principal amount of loans serviced for Freddie Mac and the SBA decreased by $12.46 million to $422.75 million at December 31, 2022 from $410.29 million at September 30, 2022.
Deposits:
Deposits decreased by $31.09 million, or 1.9%, to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.63 billion at September 30, 2022.
The decrease was primarily due to a $35.69 million decrease in non-interest bearing account balances, an $18.89 million decrease in money market account balances, a $3.71 million decrease in savings account balances and a $3.04 million decrease in NOW checking account balances.
These decreases were partially offset by a $30.24 million increase in certificates of deposit account balances. Deposits consisted of the following at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands):   December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Amount Percent Amount Percent Non-interest-bearing demand $ 494,370  30.9  % $ 530,058  32.5  % NOW checking 434,832  27.2  447,779  27.5  NOW checking - reciprocal 9,910  0.6  —  —  Savings 279,514  17.5  283,219  17.4  Money market 224,896  14.0  243,919  14.9  Money market - reciprocal 4,747  0.3  4,617  0.3  Certificates of deposit under $250 110,897  6.9  100,754  6.1  Certificates of deposit $250 and over 41,924  2.6  21,830  1.3  Total $ 1,601,090   100.0   % $ 1,632,176   100.0   % FHLB Borrowings:
The Company has short- and long-term borrowing lines with the FHLB with total credit available on the lines equal to 45% of the Bank's total assets, limited by available collateral. There were no FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Shareholders’ Equity:   Total shareholders’ equity increased by $4.98 million, or 2.3%, to $223.55 million at December 31, 2022 from $218.57 million at September 30, 2022.  The increase was primarily due to net income of $7.51 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $397,000 from the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by dividend payments to common shareholders of $2.64 million, and the repurchase of 10,570 shares of the Company's common stock for $348,000 (an average price of $32.88 per share).
Asset Quality:
The non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.12% at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Total non-performing assets decreased by $32,000, or 1.5%, to $2.13 million at December 31, 2022 from $2.17 million at September 30, 2022.
The decrease in non-performing assets was due to a $24,000 decrease in non-accrual loans and a $8,000 decrease in non-accrual investment securities.

Net income per diluted common share increased by $0.25, or 38.5%, to $0.90 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $0.65 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increases in net income and net income per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to a $5.05 million increase in net interest income. This increase was partially offset by a $1.27 million increase in non-interest expense, a $737,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $525,000 increase in the provision for loans losses and a $492,000 increase in the provision for income taxes . A more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below. Net Interest Income:
Net interest income increased by $5.05 million, or 39.8%, to $17.74 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $12.70 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits in banks and CDs, an increase in the average yield and balance of investment securities and an increase in average balance of loans, as the Company placed a portion of its excess overnight liquidity into higher-earning loans and investments during the period.
This increase was partially offset by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in deferred SBA PPP loan origination fees recognized due to a decrease in the volume of forgiven SBA PPP loans between the periods. Total interest and dividend income increased by $5.77 million, or 43.2%, to $19.11 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $13.34 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in the average yield and balance of investment securities, the average balance of loans receivable and the average yield on interest-bearing deposits in banks and CDs.
These increase were partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and CDs. Average total interest-earning assets increased by $20.43 million, or 1.2%, to $1.76 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $1.74 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Average investment securities increased by $167.35 million, or 107.3%, average loans receivable increased by $167.01 million, or 16.7% and was partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and CDs of $313.90 million, or 54.1%, between the periods.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the accretion of the purchase accounting fair value discount on acquired loans increased interest income on loans by $28,000 compared to $57,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The incremental accretion will change during any period based on the volume of prepayments but is expected to decrease over time as the balance of the net discount declines.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there was a total of $120,000 of pre-payment penalties, non-accrual interest and late fees collected, compared to $145,000 collected for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The average yield on interest-earning assets increased to 4.34% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from 3.07% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits in banks and CDs and on investment securities increased 339 basis points and 170 basis points to 3.59% and 2.74%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2021, while the average yield on loans receivable decreased nine basis points to 4.97% during the same period.
Also impacting the average yield on loans receivable and average interest-earning asset balances during the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were SBA PPP loans.
These PPP loans have a prescribed interest rate of 1.00% and are also subject to loan origination fees which are accreted into interest income over the life of each loan . Total interest expense increased by $723,000, or 111.9%, to $1.37 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $646,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and to a much lesser extent an increase in the average balance.
The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.50% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from 0.24% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $28.54 million, or 2.7%, to $1.09 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $1.07 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in the average balances of money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance of NOW checking accounts.
As a result of these changes, the net interest margin ("NIM") increased to 4.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from 2.92% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
41 Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities and average yields and costs.

There was no provision for loan losses for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were net recoveries of $1,000 compared to net charge-offs of $1,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Non-accrual loans decreased by $24,000, or 1.2%, to $2.04 million at December 31, 2022 from $2.06 million at September 30, 2022 and decreased by $818,000, or 28.7%, from $2.85 million at December 31, 2021.
Total delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more) and non-accrual loans increased by $157,000, or 7.5%, to $2.25 million at December 31, 2022, from $2.10 million at September 30, 2022 and decreased by $983,000, or 30.4%, from $3.24 million one year ago.  The $631,000 balance of SBA PPP loans was omitted from the Company's normal allowance for loan losses calculation at December 31, 2022, as these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, and management expects that most PPP borrowers will seek full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations from the SBA within a short time frame, which will in turn reimburse the Bank for the amount forgiven.
The Company has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses.  On a quarterly basis, the Company performs an analysis that considers pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio.  These factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio, historic loss experience for various loan segments, changes in economic conditions, delinquency rates, a detailed analysis of impaired loans, and other factors to determine an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses.
Impaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be allocated to each loan.  The aggregate principal impairment reserve amount determined at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 was $127,000 and was $254,000 at December 31, 2021.  43 In accordance with GAAP, loans acquired in the South Sound Acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loan's contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses.
Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value, and, as a result, no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date.
The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios.
The remaining fair value discount on loans acquired in the South Sound Acquisition was $239,000 at December 31, 2022.
The Company believes that this should be considered by investors when comparing the Company's allowance for loan losses to total loans in periods prior to the South Sound Acquisition. Based on its comprehensive analysis, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of $14.23 million at December 31, 2022 (1.20% of loans receivable and 699.2% of non-performing loans) was adequate to provide for   probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date.  The allowance for loan losses was $13.70 million (1.20% of loans receivable and 665.5% of non-performing loans) at September 30, 2022 and $13.47 million (1.34% of loans receivable and 472.1% of non-performing loans) at December 31, 2021.
While the Company believes that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, there can be no assurance that bank regulators, in reviewing the Company's loan portfolio, will not request the Company to significantly increase its allowance for loan losses.
In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate.
A further decline in national and local economic conditions, as a result of the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowing economic growth, among other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 1, Financial Statements.” Non-interest Income:
Total non-interest income decreased by $737,000, or 21.4%, to $2.71 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $3.44 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
This decrease was primarily due to a $642,000 decrease in net gain on sales of loans, a $119,000 decrease in the net valuation recovery on loan servicing rights and smaller decreases in several other categories. These decreases to non-interest income were partially offset by a $34,000 increase in service charges on deposits and smaller increases in several other categories. The decrease in net gain on sales of loans was primarily due to a decrease in the dollar amount of fixed-rate one- to four-family loans originated and sold during the current quarter reflecting reduced refinance activity compared to the same period last year. Gain on sale of loans was also impacted by rising interest rates, declining homes sales and a decision to retain a higher percentage of single family loans originated during the quarter in the portfolio rather than selling them. Non-interest Expense:   Total non-interest expense increased by $1.27 million, or 13.7%, to $10.54 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $9.26 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to a $729,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $176,000 increase in data processing and telecommunication expense, a $158,000 increase in professional fees and smaller increases in several other categories, which were partially offset by smaller decreases in several categories.
The increase in salaries and other employee benefits was primarily due to annual salary adjustments (effective October 1, 2022) and the hiring of additional lending personnel.
The increase in professional fees was primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees. The increase in data processing and telecommunication expense was primarily due to the addition of several technology products and increased processing volumes. The efficiency ratio for the current quarter improved to 51.52% from 57.40% for the comparable quarter one year ago. Provision for Income Taxes:
The provision for income taxes increased by $492,000, or 35.4%, to $1.88 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $1.39 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to higher income before income taxes. The Company's effective income tax rate was 20.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and 20.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Liquidity The Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, the sale of loans, maturing investment securities, maturing CDs held for investment and FHLB borrowings (if needed).  While the maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to help ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund its operations. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs.  At
44 December 31, 2022, the Bank's regulatory liquidity ratio (net cash, and short-term and marketable assets, as a percentage of net deposits and short-term liabilities) was 26.22%.  At December 31, 2022, the Bank maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the FHLB that provided for immediately available borrowings up to an aggregate amount equal to 45% of total assets, limited by available collateral, under which no amounts were outstanding.
The Bank had $513.48 million available for borrowings with the FHLB at December 31, 2022.
The Bank maintains a short-term borrowing line with the FRB with total credit based on eligible collateral.  At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no outstanding balance on this borrowing line, under which $84.89 million was available for future borrowings.
The Bank also maintains a $50.00 million overnight borrowing line with Pacific Coast Bankers' Bank ("PCBB").
At December 31, 2022, the Bank did not have an outstanding balance on this borrowing line. Subject to market conditions, the Bank expects to utilize these borrowing facilities from time to time in the future to fund loan originations and deposits withdrawals, to satisfy other financial commitments, repay maturing debt and to take advantage of investment opportunities to the extent feasible. Liquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Bank's management.  The Bank adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management's assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, and (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits.  Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits, CDs held for investment and short-term government and agency obligations.  If the Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB, the FRB and PCBB.
The Bank's primary investing activity is the origination of loans and, to a lesser extent, the purchase of investment securities. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank originated $101.67 million and $176.60 million of loans, respectively.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank had loan commitments totaling $148.06 million and undisbursed construction loans in process totaling $112.10 million.  Investment securities purchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $31.31 million and $48.49 million, respectively. The Bank’s liquidity is also affected by the volume of loans sold and loan principal payments.  During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank sold $1.16 million and $22.56 million, respectively, in loans and loan participation interests.  During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank received $50.71 million
and $113.41 million in principal repayments, respectively.
The Bank's liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, CDs held for investment and investment securities decreased to $583.55 million at December 31, 2022 from $648.51 million at September 30, 2022.
CDs that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled $108.05 million.
Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Capital expenditures are incurred on an ongoing basis to expand and improve the Bank's product offerings, enhance and modernize technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in the various markets. Capital expenditure projects are evaluated based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and the expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. Based on current objectives, there are no projects scheduled for capital investments in premises and equipment during the remaining nine months ending September 30, 2023 that would materially impact liquidity.
The Company currently expects to continue the current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock subject to the Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice.
The current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.23 per share, as approved by the Board of Directors, which is a dividend rate per share that enables the Company to balance multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank and returning a substantial portion of cash to shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal year 2023 at the rate of $0.23 per share, the average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $1.90 million based on the number of current outstanding shares (which assumes no increases or decreases in the number of shares).
For the remaining nine months ending September 30, 2023, the Bank projects that fixed commitments will include $233,000 of operating lease payments.
There are no scheduled payments and maturities of FHLB borrowings during the fiscal year 2023. In addition, at December 31, 2022, there were other future obligations and accrued expenses of $8.90 million.
The Bank's management believes that the liquid assets combined with the available lines of credit provide adequate liquidity to meet current financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. 45 Timberland Bancorp is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses.
Sources of capital and liquidity for Timberland Bancorp include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities.
At December 31, 2022, Timberland Bancorp (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $2.56 million. Capital Resources The Bank, as a state-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the FDIC. Under the FDIC's capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
The Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. Based on its capital levels at December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as of that date.
Consistent with the Bank's goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, it is the Bank's policy to maintain a "well-capitalized" status under the regulatory capital categories of the FDIC.
Based on capital levels at December 31, 2022, the Bank was considered to be "well-capitalized" under applicable regulatory requirements.
Management monitors the capital levels to provide for current and future business opportunities and to maintain the Bank's "well-capitalized" status.
The following table compares the Bank’s actual capital amounts at December 31, 2022 to its minimum regulatory capital requirements at that date (dollars in thousands):   Actual Regulatory Minimum To Be “Adequately Capitalized” To Be “Well Capitalized” Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions   Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Leverage Capital Ratio:             Tier 1 capital $206,651  11.32  % $73,054  4.00  % $91,317  5.00  % Risk-based Capital Ratios: Common equity Tier 1 capital 206,651  17.81  52,208  4.50  75,412  6.50  Tier 1 capital 206,651  17.81  69,612  6.00  92,815  8.00  Total capital 221,154  19.06  92,815  8.00  116,019  10.00  In addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank's CET1 capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer.
Timberland Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve.
Bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.
For a bank holding company with less than $3.0 billion in assets (as of June 30th of the preceding year), the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures :  An evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company’s senior management as of the end of the period covered by this report.  The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.   (b) Changes in Internal Controls :  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  The Company continued, however, to implement suggestions from its internal auditor and independent auditors to strengthen existing controls.  The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud.  A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; as over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 47 PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.       Legal Proceedings Neither the Company nor the Bank is a party to any material legal proceedings at this time.  From time to time, the Bank is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
