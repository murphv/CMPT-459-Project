CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks
and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements we make concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs and other information that is not historical information.
When used in this quarterly report, the words “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,”
“forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes,” “foresees,” “seeks,”
“likely,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “goal,” “target”
or “intends” and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of any such words) are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this
Quarterly Report.
These

Going
Concern and Management’s Plans
These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, for the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company
had:
●
Net
loss of $ 1,326,803 ; and
●
Net
cash used in operations of $ 509,809
Additionally,
at January 31, 2023, the Company had:
●
Accumulated
deficit of $ 4,034,958
●
Stockholders’
equity of $ 5,169,439 ; and
●
Working
capital of $ 123,605
We
manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand
of $ 180,442
at January 31, 2023. Although the Company intends to raise additional debt or equity capital, the Company expects to continue
to incur significant losses from operations and have negative cash flows from operating activities for the near-term. These losses could
be significant as operations ramp up along with continuing expenses related to compensation, professional fees, and regulatory are incurred.
The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve
profitable operations. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or if achieved, could be sustained
on a continuing basis. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances, including our financial
position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ended January 31, 2024, and our current capital structure including
equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.
The
Company has satisfied its obligations from the issuance of common stock; however, there is no assurance that such successful efforts
will continue during the twelve months subsequent to the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.
If
the Company does not obtain additional capital, the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its business development activities
or cease operations. The Company continues to explore obtaining additional capital financing and the Company is closely monitoring its
cash balances, cash needs, and expense levels.

(UNAUDITED)
These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period
subsequent to the date that these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as
a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary
course of business.
Management’s
strategic plans include the following:
●
Pursuing
additional capital raising opportunities,
●
Continuing
to explore and execute prospective partnering or distribution opportunities;
●
Identifying
strategic acquisitions; and
●
Identifying
unique market opportunities that represent potential positive short-term cash flow.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for interim financial statements (“U.S. GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial
statements.
In
the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all of the adjustments
necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and six months ended January
31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period.
These
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on October 31, 2022.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)
Management
acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements which reflect all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its consolidated
financial position and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods presented.
Principles
of Consolidation
These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Business
Combinations
The
Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805,
Business Combinations
which
requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent assets and liabilities, at their respective
fair values on the date of acquisition.
Business
Segments and Concentrations
The
Company uses the “management approach” to identify its reportable segments. The management approach requires companies to
report segment financial information consistent with information used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance
as the basis for identifying the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business as a single operating segment.
Use
of Estimates
Preparing
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company accounts for financial instruments under ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements .
ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date, based on the Company’s principal or, in absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific
asset or liability.
The
Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement.
The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining
fair value.
The
three tiers are defined as follows:
●
Level
1 —Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
●
Level
2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace
for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and
●
Level
3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.
The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement’s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management’s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate.
Although
the Company believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative
of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
The
Company’s financial instruments, including cash, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at historical cost. At
January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because
of the short-term nature of these instruments.

ASC
825-10
“Financial Instruments”
allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (“fair value option”). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument
should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding
financial instruments.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months
or less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.
At
January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.
The
Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent
account balances exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is $ 250,000 . At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company did not
experience any losses on cash balances in excess of FDIC insured limits.
Investment
The
Company owns
150,000
shares of iGrow Systems Inc. The shares are valued at cost $ 15,000
($ 0.10 /share). The investment is recorded on
the Company’s balance sheet using the cost method of accounting.
Goodwill
and Impairment
In
financial reporting, goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the
business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential
impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. All assessments of goodwill impairment are conducted
at the individual reporting unit level.
The
Company uses qualitative factors according to ASC 350-20-35-3 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of
goodwill is less than its carrying amount. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined there
were
no
impairments of goodwill.

Intangible
Assets and Impairment
Definite-lived
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed
for impairment annually. The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
There
were no impairment losses for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Impairment
of Long-lived Assets
Management
evaluates the recoverability of the Company’s identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances
indicate a potential impairment exists, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35-15
“Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.”
If
impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets’ carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to
be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
There
were no impairment losses for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.
Expenditures

property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective

Operating
Lease
From
time to time, we may enter into operating lease or sub-lease agreements, including our corporate headquarters. We account for leases
in accordance with ASC Topic 842:
Leases,
which requires a lessee to utilize the right-of-use model and to record a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either financing
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. In addition, a lessor
is required to classify leases as either sales-type, financing or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of
the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer
of control, the lease is treated as financing. If the lessor does not convey risk and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.
Right-of-use
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments over the lease term. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at commencement are initially measured at the present value
of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement
to determine the present value of lease payments except when an implicit interest rate is readily determinable. We determine our incremental
borrowing rate based on market sources including relevant industry data.
We
may have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease
and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception
of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and
pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for
separately, would be classified as an operating lease.
We
have elected not to present short-term leases on the balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date
in determining the present value of lease payments.

(UNAUDITED)
Our
leases, where we are the lessee, do not include an option to extend the lease term. Our lease does not include an option to terminate
the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease term would include options
to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.
Lease
expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense, included as a component
of general and administrative expenses, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Certain
operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate, our lease has no stated increase, payments
were fixed at lease inception. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement
date. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred.
See
Note 9.
Revenue
Recognition
OpenLocker
generates revenue from two main sources, primary sales of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) on its online store and commissions collected from sales on the secondary
marketplace.
Revenue
is recognized in accordance with ASC No. 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The Company recognizes
revenue when its performance obligations are complete, which occurs at a point in time related to the transfer of an NFT to its customer.
Currently, all sales contain a single performance obligation.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY

(UNAUDITED)
All
payments are received from third-party payment processing providers. The Company receives payments from sales on its primary marketplace
(Shopify site) as well as two other sources. Each of these sources of payment relate to the completion of a single performance obligation
completed at a point in time, which occurs upon the transfer of an NFT and where no further performance obligations are required:
●
Shopify
payouts from credit/debit cards transactions typically occur 2-3 days after date of sale,
●
PayPal
payments are received same day; and
●
Cryptocurrency
payments are deposited immediately into OpenLocker’s Coin Payments account.
The
Company also recognizes revenues generated from the
5 % commission fee collected on secondary marketplace sales transacted on the OpenLocker
Trading Portal site, operated by Mint Blockchain Solutions, which is deposited into a blocto wallet. The platform uses FUSD (1:1 USD-backed
stablecoin) as the fungible token on the Flow network. Conversion from FUSD to USD and transfers to the Company’s bank account will be made
on a monthly basis.
Shipping
fees collected from customers for physical collectibles are included with revenues received from Shopify payouts. The majority of those
collectibles have not yet been shipped due to a delay in receiving the goods from our vendor. Prior to the product shipping, any amounts
received in advance are accounted for as contract liabilities (deferred revenue).
Software
Development Costs
Internal-use
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software”. The costs incurred
in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred.
Once
an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically
three
to
five years ).

Maintenance
and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs
relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.
The
Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired
or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs will
be included in cost of goods sold in the statements of operations.
For
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $ 57,602
and $ 0 , respectively, in software development costs.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $ 130,124
and $ 0 , respectively, in software development costs.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740,
“Income Taxes”.
Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”.
Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the
position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, the
Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.
The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. No interest and penalties
related to uncertain income tax positions were recorded for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.

For

Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718
“Compensation – Stock Compensation”
using the
fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized
over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions
in which an entity exchanges it equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities
in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of those equity instruments.
When
determining fair value of stock options, the Company considers the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes model:
●

●

●

Basic
and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share
Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented.
Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents
and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of common stock issuable
for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents
may be dilutive in the future. In the event of a net loss, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share since the effect
of the potential common stock equivalents upon conversion would be anti-dilutive.
The
Company effected a reverse merger and recapitalization on July 29, 2021. As a result, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively
restated to the earliest period presented (for the period ended July 31, 2021).

Acquisition and Pro Forma Financial Information for Open Locker, Inc.

On
May 31, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with OL and issued
12,500,002
shares of common stock, having a fair
value of $ 5,142,001
($ 0.41 /share), based upon recent cash offering prices in third party sales, to purchase
100 % of OL’s outstanding
stock in a transaction treated as a business combination.
The
cash price paid by third parties was the best evidence of fair value given the Company is thinly traded on OTC markets and had more sales
of stock sold for cash than stock traded on the open market at the time of the transaction.
We
made an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based on our understanding of the fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price consideration was finalized as of July 31, 2022, with the excess purchase
price allocated to an intangible asset, which consisted of intellectual property and goodwill.
The
acquisition of OL was reflected in the consolidated financial statements at July 31, 2022

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of OpenLocker Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company” or “OpenLocker”) should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. References
in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to “us,” “we,”
“our,” and similar terms refer to the Company. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events
could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those
set forth under the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 31, 2022, as the same may be updated from time to time. We use words such
as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,”
“expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,”
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
Overview
Established
on August 25, 2021, is a technology platform for athletes and brands to redefine and unlock consumer and fan value. OpenLocker builds
engaged fan communities on the blockchain primarily for colleges and universities using athletes Name, Image and Likeness (N.I.L.). OpenLocker
increases engagement among fans, athletes and brands through digital and physical collectibles and provides unique user utility, perks
and experiences. Utilizing Flow, a fast, scalable and reliable blockchain, we are able to reduce energy consumption which is better for
the environment.
The OpenLocker mission is
to empower athletes to monetize their fan engagement with innovative physical and digital collectibles and to create meaningful experiences
by using our technology to build communities and deliver benefits. OpenLocker offers physical collectibles including autographed collectibles
and personalized experiences (meet-and-greet or customized activity) with the athlete, arranged by OpenLocker with the athlete’s
input and approval. OpenLocker also offers digital collectibles including one-of-one digital images with the athlete’s Name, Image
and Likeness (NIL). Each digital collectible is authenticated on the blockchain with a unique serial number which is assigned to the fan
upon completing a transaction on the OpenLocker platform. OpenLocker connects the digital and physical worlds by creating unique wallet
sized physical collectibles with the digital art printed on one side with a “QR” (quick response) code that directs to the
fan community website. Each of these platinum card collectibles is laser-engraved with a unique serial number and hand-signed by the athlete.
OpenLocker
launched its initial fan community at the University of Connecticut in February 2022, during the first season following the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) policy change allowing student-athletes to receive compensation for their NIL. The company deliberately
included all 14 eligible members of the men’s basketball team to galvanize the fan base and named the fan community the Bone Yard
Huskyz Club (BYHC). The OpenLocker design team created the BYHC logo and Huskyz avatar to play off of the university’s Huskies
mascot with an edgy feel. A Huskyz avatar was created in the likeness of each of the athletes and selected super fans for branding and
awareness campaigns. A website with a project roadmap outlining the perks and rewards of club membership was activated two weeks prior
to the release date, which was strategically timed around the basketball team’s season schedule. A comprehensive marketing campaign
included digital programmatic advertising, organic and paid social media strategy (including pre- and post-drop Twitter spaces conversations
with fans, blockchain experts, athletes and parents of athletes), podcasts, email blasts and gorilla marketing at several home basketball
games. The OpenLocker athlete liaison also provided the athletes with graphics and talking points they could use to leverage their social
media followings and promote sales of their collectibles by word-of-mouth.
35
A
majority of the revenue from the BYHC project was generated on the first day of sales of the digital collectibles. The first two hours
were the busiest as fans were incentivized by the autographed “Platinum card” that was included with purchase for the
first 25 digital collectibles sold per athlete. This unique collectible is a metal, wallet-sized card hand-signed by the athlete with
the digital art printed on the front and a QR code that directs to boneyardhuskyzclub.com. Customer behavior and feedback confirmed that
the physical collectible was very well received by the majority of fans, especially those who had little to no experience with blockchain
technology. Sales were also directly impacted by the team’s postseason tournament performance in March 2022, as would be expected
for all categories of sport collectibles and memorabilia.
As
of March 2023, the Company has activated communities at University of Connecticut (Bone Yard Huskyz Club), Pennsylvania State
University (Lionz Club), University of Florida (Gatorverse), Radford University (Rowdy Redz), Florida Atlantic University (Prowlerz
Club), University of Wisconsin (Maddy Baddyz), University of Kentucky (the 15 Blue Club) and Coastal Carolina University (Peoplez
Club). The Company anticipates expanding the existing clubs to include more men’s and women’s sports at the
respective schools with additional athlete signings, merchant partnerships and exclusive content. In addition, the Company is evaluating
opportunities to grow at other highly regarded schools.
OpenLocker
entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Student Athlete NIL, LLC in September 2022 which operates the Success With Honor
(SWH) Collective at Penn State University. Collaboration with SWH, whose primary aim is to help maximize student-athletes’ NIL
opportunities, has enabled OpenLocker to sign NIL contracts with several of the top collegiate athletes in the country, including nationally
ranked and NCAA championship wrestlers. The Company also has access to the SWH’s large database of fans with a track record of
giving to the university and making direct contributions to its student-athletes.
OpenLocker
launched the Brave Heartz Lacrosse Club (BHLC) in September 2022 featuring two of the top lacrosse players in the Premier Lacrosse League
which offers unparalleled access to training, mentoring and opportunities for fans to attend a game and meet the athletes in person.
OpenLocker has been in discussions with professional athletes in a variety of sports including golf, race car driving, e-sports, and
beyond.
OpenLocker
aims to pay athletes a majority of the revenue generated from sales of their collectibles and compensate them for fan engagement; therefore,
it does not currently have licensing agreements with any universities, conferences, leagues or other entities. OpenLocker believes that
licensing the NIL directly with each athlete allows OpenLocker to retain more revenue, while giving the athlete a larger percentage of
such revenue, which is an important differentiating factor for OpenLocker in the sports collectibles and NIL space.
OpenLocker
launched the OpenStable marketplace in April 2022 to engage the next generation of thoroughbred racing enthusiasts. Through its relationships
with owners, trainers and influencers in the racing industry, OpenStable gives fans access to exclusive information, real life experiences,
and memorabilia so that they may engage in a truly immersive journey covering a racehorse’s career.
The
launch strategy for the OpenStable marketplace involved reaching the largest audience of racing fans (both casual and committed) by creating
a collection of collectibles featuring the leading contenders in the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks, scheduling their release on the
weekend prior to each of those two prominent races. Per a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated April 15, 2022, OpenLocker and Horse
Races Now established terms for a marketing collaboration, whereby Horse Races Now agreed to drive traffic from its app and e-mail marketing
campaigns targeted at its existing user base of racing fans, in exchange for OpenLocker paying Horse Races Now 12.5% of its retained
revenues (after transaction fees) generated from sales of all collections on OpenStable.
The
MOU has provided OpenLocker with access to the Horse Races Now’s database of 600,000 users and placement in their app. OpenLocker
executed a weeklong digital promotion in the Daily Racing Form and conducted media interviews, as well as social media campaigns. While
the racing season was at its height, OpenLocker benefited from significant traffic to its website and generated some sales of gear, including
apparel, hats, pins, and other items featuring each racehorse’s unique brand (also featuring the OpenStable logo).
36
OpenLocker
has also entered into a partnership agreement with In the Money Media to produce podcasts featuring interviews with owners, trainers
and jockeys with a connection to the horses in the OpenStable family. An episode included a conversation with an OpenStable fan who won
exclusive access to the paddock and winner’s circle at the 2022 Travers Stakes at the Saratoga Race Course in August 2022 allowing
him to see Epicenter before and after the race. OpenLocker also has an agreement with horse racing analyst and Fox Sports announcer,
Jonathon Kinchen, to provide promotional support and strategic planning for additional projects in the collegiate sports and horse racing
industries. The Company collaborated with Old Smoke Clothing Company to create a one-of-a-kind Winchell/Epicenter button-up shirt for
racing fans. A limited edition shirt featuring a gold OpenStable tag on the sleeve is available exclusively on the OpenStable platform
for Epicenter digital collectibles holders only and may be purchased as a bundle with Epicenter collectibles.
The
user-friendly interface that OpenLocker created for college sports fans and emphasis on fan community building is an important differentiator
for OpenStable as it seeks to position itself as the next-generation marketing solution within the thoroughbred racing space. Offering
ownership of digital tokens along with rewards and experiences, both in the virtual and physical realms, makes OpenStable products attractive
to a younger audience with a goal to develop a next generation younger fan engagement around the thoroughbred racing sport.
OpenLocker’s
current revenue model includes (i) profit sharing of primary sales on the OpenLocker platform with partners and athletes, (ii) collecting
transaction fees from transactions on OpenLocker’s trading portal, (iii) sponsorship and advertising, and (iv) fees for additional
creative design work, development and product fulfillment services.
The
Company has been in discussions with retailers and brands who are interested in applying the fan engagement model to build customer loyalty
and drive foot traffic to their brick-and-mortar locations. We expect to provide strategic guidance through a network of experienced
executives with operational and industry expertise, as well as financing support and other resources necessary to drive value.
OpenLocker
believes that it has found a unique and attractive market for the application of blockchain technology by focusing on the college athlete
market. In September 2022, OpenLocker rolled out an enhanced Web3 environment that allows fans to access their digital collectibles with
a Dapper wallet. Fans that currently held assets purchased on the OpenLocker platform prior to the rollout were given instructions on
how to transition to the new environment in a few simple steps. The Dapper wallet, developed by Dapper Labs, has become a trusted partner
in blockchain development with millions of users benefiting from its integration with some of the largest sports NFT ventures including
NBA Top Shot, NFL All Day and other large-scale consumer offerings.
OpenLocker
expects to announce additional enhancements and smartphone integrations to create even more seamless delivery of physical rewards and
experiences in early 2023.
Recent
Developments
Following
the Company’s uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market in October 2022, the Company filed an application with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Associate (“FINRA”) to change its name to “OpenLocker Holdings, Inc.” and to change its ticker symbol.
In connection therewith, on December 5, 2022, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of amendment to certificate
of incorporation in order to change its corporate name from OpenLocker Holdings, Inc. to OpenLocker Holdings, Inc. Effective December
9, 2022 for trading purposes, the Company’s corporate name was changed from “Descrypto Holdings, Inc.” to “OpenLocker
Holdings, Inc.” Also effective December 9, 2022, the trading symbol for the Company’s common stock will change from “DSRO”
to “OLKR”.
Plan
of Operations
Over
the next 12 months, we expect to require approximately $1,000,000 in operating funds to carry out our intended plan of operations.
37
We
are planning to obtain the funds necessary to execute our plan of operations from various capital raises, including potentially through
private placements or our common stock or the issuance and sales of convertible notes, as well as potentially through a registration
statement or an offering statement filed with the SEC.
There
can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds for our foregoing operations on terms that are acceptable to us
or at all, and there can be no assurance that our plan of operations can be executed as planned, or at all.
In
addition, as we grow, we seek to acquire companies with:
●
defensible
barriers to entry,
●
proven
value propositions,
●
identifiable
growth opportunities or operational improvements, and
●
paths
to sustainable competitive advantages.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenue of $5,949 and $0, respectively. The increase in revenue was due
to OpenLocker’s physical and digital collectible related sales. The Company’s prior year operations did not include OpenLocker, Inc., which was acquired
on May 31, 2022.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenue of $11,089 and $0, respectively. The increase in revenue was due
to OpenLocker’s physical and digital collectible related sales. The Company’s prior year operations did not include OpenLocker, Inc., which was acquired
on May 31, 2022.
Operating
Expenses
Operating
expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $767,046 and $576,795 respectively. The increase in operating expenses
was primarily due to an increase in consulting fees for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
Operating
expenses during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1,337,892 and $3,136,602, respectively. The decrease in operating
expenses was primarily due to a decrease stock-based compensation for the six months ended January 31,
2023.
Net
Loss
For
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a net loss of $761,097 and $581,640, respectively. The increase in net loss
was primarily due to an increase in consulting fees for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a net loss of $1,326,803 and $3,146,325, respectively. The decrease in net loss
was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation for the six months ended January
31, 2023.
Other
Income (Expense)—Net
Other
income (expense)—net for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0 and $(4,845), respectively. For the three months
ended January 31, 2022, other expense—net consisted of interest expense—related party of $4,845.
Other
income (expense)—net for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0 and $(9,723), respectively. For the six months ended
January 31, 2022, other expense—net consisted of interest expense—related party of $9,723.
There
is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability or revenues due to our history of losses and early stage of our business operations.
38
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As
of January 31, 2023, we had $180,442 in cash and did not have any other cash equivalents. The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. To date, we have financed
our operations primarily through the issuance of debt and equity sourced capital.
The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:

Since
inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements primarily through issuance of common stock and debt financing. As we expand our
activities, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations. We anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund
operations through additional common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary
to augment our working capital.
We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months.  Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future
operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks
for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business sector and the management of growth. To address these
risks, we must, among other things, obtain a customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continually
develop and upgrade our website, provide national and regional industry participants with an effective, efficient and accessible infrastructure
on which to promote their products and services through the Internet and blockchain technology, respond to competitive developments,
and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks,
and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect.
Effects
of Coronavirus on the Company
If
the current recurring outbreak of the coronavirus continues and its variations, the effects of such a widespread infectious disease and
epidemic may inhibit our ability to conduct our business and operations and could materially harm our Company. The coronavirus may cause
us to have to reduce operations as a result of various lock-down procedures enacted by the local, state or federal governments. The continued
coronavirus outbreak may also restrict our ability to raise funding when needed and may cause an overall decline in the economy as a
whole. The specific and actual effects of the spread of coronavirus are difficult to assess at this time as the actual effects will depend
on many factors beyond the control and knowledge of the Company. However, the spread of the coronavirus, if it continues, may cause an
overall decline in the economy as a whole and as such may materially harm our Company.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
39
Going
Concern and Management’s Plans
The
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, for the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had:
●
Net
loss of $1,326,803; and
●
Net
cash used in operations of $509,809.
Additionally,
at January 31, 2023, the Company had:
●
Accumulated
deficit of $ 4,034,958;
●
Stockholders’
equity of $5,169,439; and
●
Working
capital of $123,605.
We
manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand
of $180,442 at January 31, 2023. Although the Company intends to raise additional debt or equity capital, the Company expects to continue
to incur significant losses from operations and have negative cash flows from operating activities for the near-term. These losses could
be significant as operations ramp up along with continuing expenses related to compensation, professional fees, and regulatory are incurred.
The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve
profitable operations. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or if achieved, could be sustained
on a continuing basis. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial
position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ending January 31, 2024, and our current capital structure including
equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.
The
Company has satisfied its obligations from the issuance of common stock; however, there is no assurance that such successful efforts
will continue during the twelve months subsequent to the date these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued.
If
the Company does not obtain additional capital, the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its business development activities
or cease operations. The Company continues to explore obtaining additional capital financing and the Company is closely monitoring its
cash balances, cash needs, and expense levels.
These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent
to the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
40
Management’s
strategic plans include the following:
●
Pursuing
additional capital raising opportunities,
●
Continuing
to explore and execute prospective partnering or distribution opportunities;
●
Identifying
strategic acquisitions; and
●
Identifying
unique market opportunities that represent potential positive short-term cash flow.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company’s financial results and operations were not materially adversely impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the Company’s future financial results could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic depends
on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The Company is not aware of any specific event
or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities.
These
estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Use
of Estimates
Preparing
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Using
that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position
will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, the Company had no
uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.
The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. No interest and penalties related

Basic
and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share
Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented.
Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents
and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of common stock issuable
for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents
may be dilutive in the future. In the event of a net loss, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share since the effect
of the potential common stock equivalents upon conversion would be anti-dilutive.

A

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based upon
their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.
We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
