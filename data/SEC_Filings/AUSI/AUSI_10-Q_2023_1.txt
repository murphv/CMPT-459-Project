AURA SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Three and Nine months ended November 30, 2022
and 2021
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations
Aura Systems, Inc., (“Aura”, the “Company”)
a Delaware corporation, is engaged in the development, commercialization, and sale of products, systems, and components, using its patented
and proprietary electromagnetic technology. Aura develops and sells AuraGen® axial flux mobile induction power systems to the industrial,
commercial, and defense mobile power generation markets.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements as of and for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, have been prepared have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments of a
normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The Condensed Balance Sheet
information as of February 28, 2022, was derived from the Company’s audited Financial Statements as of February 28, 2022, included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 21, 2022. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with that report. The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2022, may not necessarily be
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending February 28, 2023.
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last
calendar day of February. Accordingly, the current fiscal year will end on February 28, 2023 and is referred to as “Fiscal 2023”.
Our prior fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, and are referred to as “Fiscal 2022” or “Fiscal 2021”.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. During the nine-month period ended November 30, 2022, the Company
reported a net loss of approximately $ 2,582,000 , and used cash in operating activities of approximately $ 2,254,000 , and at November 30,
2022, had a stockholders’ deficit of approximately $ 20.2
million. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s February 28, 2022, financial statements, raised substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
In the event the Company is unable to generate
profits and is unable to obtain financing for its working capital requirements, it may have to curtail its business further or cease business
altogether. Substantial additional capital resources will be required to fund continuing expenditures related to our research, development,
manufacturing and business development activities. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to retain its current financing, to obtain additional financing,
and ultimately to attain profitability.
During the next twelve months the Company intends
to continue to attempt to increase the Company’s operations and focus on the sale of our AuraGen ® /VIPER products
both domestically and internationally and to add to our existing management team. In addition, the Company plans to source new suppliers
for manufacturing operations, rebuild the engineering and sales teams, and to the extent appropriate, utilize third party contractors
to support the operation. The Company anticipates being able to obtain new sources of funding to support these actions in the fourth fiscal
quarter of Fiscal 2023 and in the upcoming fiscal year.
5
COVID-19
As of the date of this filing, there continues
to be widespread concern regarding the ongoing impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the regions in which the Company
operates. Although the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been material to date, a prolonged downturn in economic conditions could
have a material adverse effect on our customers and demand for our services. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets
or a significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company
to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company’s business or results
of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers.
Our primary source of revenue is the
manufacture and delivery of generator sets used primarily in mobile power applications. Our principal sales channel is sales to a
domestic distributor. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue, net of discounts, for our generator sets at time
of product delivery to the domestic distributor or directly to end users (i.e. point-in-time), which also corresponds to the passage
of legal title to the customer and the satisfaction of our performance obligations to the customer.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include
assumptions made for inventory reserve, impairment testing of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions
used in valuing derivative liabilities, assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, and accruals for potential liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company periodically
issues stock options and warrants, and shares of common stock to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services
and for financing costs. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award,
and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period
and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company determines the fair values of its
financial instruments based on a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is
based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Under ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”), the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;
●
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
●
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs.
6
The recorded amounts of inventory, other current
assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of notes
payable and convertible notes payable approximate their respective fair values because of their current interest rates payable in relation
to current market conditions.
The following table sets
forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company’s assets and liabilities at fair value as of November 30, 2022 and
February 28, 2022:

The Company estimated the fair value of the derivative
warrant liability using a binomial model.
Loss per share
The Company’s loss per share amounts have
been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Basic earnings (loss) per share
is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock assuming all potential shares had been issued, and the additional shares of common
stock were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution, using the as-if-converted method for convertible
debt, and the treasury stock method for options and warrants, which could occur if all potentially dilutive securities were exercised.
For the nine-months ended November 30, 2022 and
November 30, 2021, the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potentially dilutive securities would have
had an anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive securities consisted of the following:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06,
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other
Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)
(“ASU 2020-06”) .
ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the cash conversion and beneficial
conversion models. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost
as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type
of contracts primarily affected by this update are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the
current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement conditions of the derivative scope exception. This update simplifies the related
settlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider
whether collateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective March 1, 2024, for the Company
and the provisions of this update can be adopted using either the modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method. Early
adoption is permitted and effective March 1, 2022, the Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The
adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic
718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain
Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options
(“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides
guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified
written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument
for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the
modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition
model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt
origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective
for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should
apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date. The Company
adopted ASU 2021-04 effective March 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statement
presentation or disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not
Yet Adopted
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Credit
Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a
forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments,
including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company
beginning March 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the potential impact of the new guidance and related
codification improvements will be material to its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future financial statements.

NOTE 2 – RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2021
The unaudited condensed financial statements for
the nine months ended November 30, 2021 and certain balances as of February 28, 2021 have been restated. During the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2022, our management determined the following:
●
that the Company erroneously did not recognize a derivative warrant liability associated with warrants issued by prior management in prior years that included a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder. As such, the Company determined that the warrants fundamental transaction provision created a derivative liability pursuant to current accounting guidelines.
●
that the Company had
issued common stock in exchange for a settlement of debt to a former employee during Fiscal 2018 and had erroneously omitted
accounting for it until Fiscal 2021.
●
that the Company had granted stock options during Fiscal 2021 which were erroneously
unrecorded.
The effects on the previously issued financial statements are as follows:
(A)
In Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized that previously issued warrants by prior management had characteristics of derivative liabilities. The Company determined the fair value of the warrant derivative liability, including its initial recording and revaluation for changes in fair value and expiring warrants, as of February 28, 2021, was $ 1,366,375 , and recorded the liability and its associated expense as a prior period adjustment to Accumulated Deficit in the amount of $ 1,366,375 . Additionally, the warrant derivative liability was revalued at May 31, 2021, August 31, 2021 and November 30, 2021 and the net decreases in fair value of $ 56,640
at May 31, 2021 and $ 127,420
at August 31, 2021 were recorded as reductions to the liability. The increase in fair value of $ 734,106
was recorded as an increase to the liability. The associated other expense of $ 734,106
for the three-month period ended November 30, 2021 was recorded to the statement of operations as a loss for the increase in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability. The associated aggregate other expense of $ 550,046
for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2021 was recorded to the statement of operations and consisted of a loss for the increase in fair value of $ 594,666
and a gain on expiring warrants of $ 44,620 .
(B)
In Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized that during Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded the effect of issuing common stock for debt to a former employee when the issuance had occurred in Fiscal 2018. To correct the timing of recording the transaction, the Company calculated the gain on the extinguishment of debt as of the February 28, 2018, issuance date in the amount of $ 256,044
and recorded the gain as a prior period adjustment to Accumulated Deficit. Additionally, the interest expense associated with the debt of $ 13,460
and gain on its extinguishment of $ 133,500
recorded in Fiscal 2021 were reversed out of the statement of operations. The resulting net impact of these prior period adjustments for the Fiscal 2022 beginning balance is a decrease to Additional paid-in capital of $ 136,004
and a corresponding $ 136,004
decrease in Accumulated Deficit.
(C)
In Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized that certain stock options granted during Fiscal 2021 should have been fully or partially vested in the year of grant but had no share-based compensation expense recorded in Fiscal 2021. To correct the timing of the expense recognition, the Company computed the amount of expense associated with the vesting as of February 28, 2021 and recorded an additional $ 258,636
of share-based compensation expense to the statement of operations. The resulting net impact of these prior period adjustments for the Fiscal 2022 beginning balance is an increase to Additional paid-in capital of $ 258,636
and a corresponding $ 258,636
increase in Accumulated Deficit. Additionally, in order to correct the timing of the expense recognition as it continued into Fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an additional $ 68,862   and $ 153,388
of share-based compensation expense to the statement of operations for the three-month and the nine-month periods ended November 30, 2021, respectively, as well as recording the associated increases to Additional paid-in capital in their respective periods.
(D)
In Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized that certain stock options granted during Fiscal 2021 were being recorded as payroll compensation expense in Fiscal 2022. Restatement item (C) noted above properly recognizes the amount and timing of the share-based compensation expense, which results in the need to reverse the payroll compensation recorded in Fiscal 2022. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2021, payroll compensation expense of $ 91,356
and $ 276,606 , respectively, was reversed out of the statement of operations, and the associated liability in Accrued expenses was reduced by the same amount.

Reclassifications
(1)
In Fiscal 2021 and the nine-months ended November 30, 2021, the Company presented interest accrued of $ 8,064
on its Economic Injury Disaster Loan as additional note payable principle.  In the accompanying condensed financial statements, the Company has reclassified the cumulative accrued interest of $ 8,064
recorded in Fiscal 2021 and the first nine months of Fiscal 2022 from notes payable to accrued interest.

(a) Kopple Notes
In fiscals 2013 through 2018, the Company issued notes payable to Robert
Kopple and associated entities (collectively “Kopple”) in the aggregate of $ 6,107,323 . Robert Kopple is the former Vice-Chairman
of the Company’s Board of Directors and is a current shareholder in the Company. The notes were unsecured, bear interest at rates
ranging from
5 % and
15 % per annum and were due in fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018. Kopple brought suit against the Company beginning in
2017 for repayment of the notes.
At February 28, 2022, the accrued interest due
to Kopple totaled $ 6,533,318 . Due to its significance, the balance of accrued interest is added to the note payable principal for presentation
on the accompanying balance sheet as of February 28, 2022. As of February 28, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Kopple notes payable
and accrued interest amounted to $ 12,140,641 .
On March 14, 2022, the Company reached an agreement
with Kopple to resolve all remaining litigation between them, including all amounts owed to Kopple under the notes. Under the terms of
the settlement, the Company agreed to issue a new note and pay Kopple an aggregate amount of $ 10,000,000 , including $ 3,000,000
to be
paid in June 2022, which was subsequently extended to January 2023 (see Note 16), and granted Koppel warrants exercisable into
3,331,664
shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $ 0.85
per share. The Company used Black-Scholes modeling to compute the fair
value of the warrants which is estimated to be $ 1,051,473 . The settlement provides for certain increases in the amount payable to Kopple
and the right of such parties to enter judgment against the Company if the Company remains in uncured default in its payment obligations.
Interest on the settled Note begins accruing in February 2023. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company is also subject to certain
affirmative and negative covenants such as periodic submission of financial statements to Koppel and restrictions on future financing
and investing activities, as defined in the agreement. Management believes such covenants are normal for this type of transaction and
that management believes meeting these covenants will not affect operations.
The Company assessed the settlement with Kopple
under ASC 470 and determined that the guidance under troubled debt restructuring should apply. Per ASC 470-60, the carrying value of
the restructured note remains the same as before the restructuring, reduced only by the fair value of the warrants issued in connection
with the transaction. The Company determined that the future undiscounted cash flows of the restructured new Kopple note exceeded the
carrying value, and accordingly, no gain was recognized, and no adjustment was made to the carrying value of the debt, other than the
adjustment for the fair value of the warrants. Interest expense on the new Kopple note will be computed using a new effective rate that
equates the present value of the future cash payments specified by the new terms with the carrying value of the debt.

(b) Note payable-Gagerman
Melvin Gagerman, the
Company’s former CEO and CFO whose employment was permanently terminated in July 2019, claims that in April 2014 the Company issued
an unsecured demand promissory note to him in the amount of $ 82,000
that bears interest at a rate of
10 % per annum. Gagerman claims that
this note has not been repaid to-date and is now owed.
In June 2022, Gagerman
brought suit against the Company for repayment of this alleged note. Despite the fact that, based on Gagerman’s allegations, the
note was issued during a period when Gagerman was the Company’s CEO, CFO, Corporate Secretary and Chairman of the Company’s
Board of Directors, Gagerman has stated that he does not possess a copy of the alleged promissory note. The Company disputes that any
amount is presently owed to Gagerman. Additionally, the Company has filed a cross-complaint against Gagerman for, among things, conversion,
violation of California Business & Professions Code §17200, and various breaches of fiduciary duty that the Company believes
Gagerman committed against the Company (see Note 15).
Based on Gagerman’s
claims, as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Gagerman notes payable and accrued interest would
amount to $ 161,605
and $ 155,428 , respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, despite the fact that the Company disputes
Gagerman’s claims, under ASC 450 -
Contingencies , the Company has recorded the claimed notes payable and accrued interest
amounts of $ 161,605
and $ 155,428 , respectively, in the accompanying balance sheets.
(c) Jiangsu Shengfeng Note
On November 20, 2019, the Company reached an
agreement with its joint venture partner Jiangsu Shengfeng regarding the return of $ 700,000
that had been advanced to the Company, and
the Company issued a non-interest-bearing promissory note for $ 700,000
to be paid over a 11-month period beginning March 15, 2020, through
February 15, 2021. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the principal due was $ 700,000 .

NOTE 11 – LEASES
Our administrative, and production operations
including warehousing, are housed in an approximately
18,000
square foot facility in Lake Forest, California. The Lake Forest lease is
for 66-months effective February 2021 through November 30, 2026.
The initial monthly base rental rate was approximately $22,000 per month
and escalates 3% each year to approximately $26,000 per month in 2026.
The lease liability was determined by discounting the future lease
payments under the lease terms using a
10 % per annum discount rate to arrive at the current lease liability.
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company
utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset includes any
lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.

NOTE 12 – DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITY
In prior years under prior management, the Company
issued warrants that include a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder.
The Company determined that the warrants do not satisfy the criteria for classification as equity instruments due to the existence of
the cash settlement feature that is not within the sole control of the Company, and the warrants are accounted for as liabilities in
accordance with ASC 815. The fair value of the warrants is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in the fair value is recognized
in earnings in the accompanying statements of operations. The warrant liability will ultimately be converted into the Company’s
equity when the warrants are exercised, or will be extinguished on the expiration of the outstanding warrants.

NOTE 14 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022,
Bettersea LLC (“Bettersea”) was an
9.9 % and
11.0 %, respectively, shareholder in the Company. For the three-months and nine-months
ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the Company incurred total fees to Bettersea of $ 50,000 , $ 44,000 , $ 118,700
and $ 126,000 ,
respectively, for various consulting services. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, a total of $ 222,614
and $ 218,507 , respectively,
was due to Bettersea and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
NOTE 15 – CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and
claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually
and in the aggregate and evaluates potential losses on such litigation if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.
However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company for
amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
In 2017, the Company’s former COO was awarded
approximately $ 238,000
in accrued salary and related charges by the California labor board. In August 2021, the Company reached a settlement
by which the Company agreed to pay approximately $ 330,000 , representing the principal award plus accrued interest. As of the time of
this filing, the Company has paid approximately $ 254,000
toward the settlement amount, including accrued interest. The remaining balance
of approximately $ 101,000 , included in accrued expenses, is to be paid no later than  March 1, 2023
and accrues interest of
10 % per annum until paid.
20
Since July 2017 the Company has been engaged
in litigation with a former director, Robert Kopple, relating to more than $ 13
million and the current equivalent of the approximately
23
million warrants, exercisable for
seven years
at a price of $ 0.10
per share, which Mr. Kopple and his affiliated entities (collectively
the “Kopple Parties”) claimed should have been originally issued to them pursuant to various agreements with the Company
entered to between 2013-2016. In March 2022, the Company reached a settlement with the Kopple Parties that resolves all claims asserted
against the Company without any admission, concession or finding of any fault, liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Company.
Under
the terms of the settlement, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $10 million over a period of seven years; $3 million
of which was originally to be paid in June 2022 and subsequently extended to January 2023, after which, interest will accrue on the unpaid
balance at a rate of 6%, compounded annually. All amounts, including all accrued interest, are to be paid no later than eight years from
the date of the initial payment. The Kopple Parties have also received seven-year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately
3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.85 per share.
The settlement also provides for standard mutual general release
provisions and includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including certain increases in the amount payable to the
Kopple Parties and the right of such parties to enter judgment against the Company if the Company remains in uncured default in its payment
obligations under the settlement.
In March 2019, various stockholders of the Company
controlling a combined total of more than
27.5
million shares delivered signed written consents to the Company removing Ronald Buschur,
William Anderson, and Si Ryong Yu as directors of the Company’s Board and electing Cipora Lavut, David Mann and Dr. Robert Lempert
as directors in their stead. These written consents represented a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock. Because of the refusal by not only the removed directors but also the Company’s prior management to recognize the
legal effectiveness of the consents, in April 2019 the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents. On July
8, 2019 the Court of Chancery entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong
Yu and William Anderson had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written
consent (b) Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann and Dr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding
stock acting by written consent, and (c) the Company’s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert
Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Versón, Jr. As a result of prior management’s unsuccessful opposition to this stockholders’
action filed in the Court of Chancery, such stockholders may be potentially entitled to recoup their litigation costs from the Company
under Delaware’s corporate benefit doctrine and/or other legal provisions. To date, no final determination has been made as to
the amount of recoupment, if any, to which such stockholders may be entitled.
In June 2022, Melvin
Gagerman, the Company’s former CEO and CFO whose employment with Aura was permanently terminated in July 2019, brought suit against
the Company for repayment of an allegedly unsecured demand promissory note in the principal amount of $ 82,000
which he claims was entered
into in April 2014 and bears interest at a rate of
10 % per annum. Despite the fact that, based on Gagerman’s allegations, the note
was issued during a period when he was the Company’s CEO, CFO, Corporate Secretary and Chairman of Aura’s Board of Directors,
Gagerman has stated that he does not possess a copy of the alleged promissory note. The Company disputes that any amount is presently
owed to Gagerman and has filed a cross-complaint against him for, among things, conversion, violation of California Business& Professions
Code §17200, and various breaches of fiduciary duty that the Company believes Gagerman committed against Aura, including without
limitation, Gagerman’s actions in opposing the valid 2019 stockholder consent action.
NOTE 16 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In December 2022, the Company executed a fourth amendment
to the March 2022 settlement to extend the balance due on the initial $3,000,000 payment to January 2023 (see Note 9). The Company paid
an additional $30,000 to the Kopple Parties for the extension, bringing the aggregate total to $105,000 for cash payments related to the
extensions.
Additionally, the Company agreed to pay an additional $ 100,000
forbearance fee to be paid with the final interest payment
under the settlement, bringing the aggregate total to $ 230,000
in these deferred forbearance fees.
Subsequent to November 30, 2022, the Company
issued
442,424
shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $ 146,000 .

Overview
Our business is based on the exploitation of
our Axial Flux Induction solution known as the AuraGen ®
for commercial and industrial applications and the VIPER for military
applications. Our business model consists of two major components: (i) sales and marketing, (ii) design and engineering. Our sales and
marketing approaches are composed of direct sales in North America and the use of agents and distributors in other areas. In North America,
our primary focus is in (a) mobile exportable power applications, (b) EV applications, (c) U.S. Military applications and (d) industrial
applications. The second component of our business model is focused on the design of new products and engineering support for the sales
activities described above. The engineering support consists of the introduction of new features for our AuraGen ® /VIPER   solution
such as higher power/torque solutions, and different input and output voltages (DC and AC input and output versions).
In Fiscal 2020 stockholders of the Company successfully
removed Ronald Buschur, William Anderson and Si Ryong Yu from the Company’s Board of Directors and elected Ms. Cipora Lavut, Mr.
David Mann and Dr. Robert Lempert as directors of the Company in their stead. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for more information. Also,
in Fiscal 2020, Melvin Gagerman –– Aura’s CEO and CFO since 2006 –– was replaced. In July 2019 Ms. Lavut
succeeded Mr. Gagerman as President and Mr. Mann succeeded Mr. Gagerman as CFO. Dr. Lempert was appointed as Secretary of the Company
by the Board of Directors also in July 2019. In the second half of Fiscal 2020, the Company began significantly increasing its engineering,
manufacturing and marketing activities. From July 8, 2019 through the end of Fiscal year 2022 (February 28, 2022), we shipped more than
140 units to customers (more than a ten-fold increase over Fiscal 2019). Although our operations were impacted in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal
2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic, during these periods we continued to expand our engineering and manufacturing capabilities. See “Item
1. Business. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022 for information regarding
the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. Our engineering, research and development costs for the three months ended November 30, 2022
and the three months ended November 30, 2021 were approximately $229,000 and $208,000, respectively. Engineering, research and development
costs for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and the nine months ended November 30, 2021 were approximately $640,000 and $371,000,
respectively. During the nine months ended November 30, 2021, we relocated all administrative offices and operations to a new state-of-the-art
facility consisting of approximately 18,000 square feet in Lake Forest, California. This new facility is wholly occupied by Aura.
During Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019, the Company’s
engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities were reduced while we focused on renegotiating numerous financial obligations.
During this time, the Company’s agreements with numerous customers, third party vendors, and organizations and entities material
to the operation of the Company business were canceled, delayed or terminated. During Fiscal 2018, the Company successfully restructured
in excess of $30 million of debt. Robert Kopple, our former Vice Chairman of the Board, was the only significant unsecured note holder
that did not execute formal agreements regarding the restructure of his debt. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022 filed with the SEC on June 21, 2022 and Part II, Other Information Item 1, contained in
this Quarterly Report for information regarding the dispute and settlement with Mr. Kopple regarding these transactions. In March 2022,
the Company reached a settlement that resolves the various claims asserted against us by Mr. Kopple and his affiliated entities (collectively
the “Kopple Parties”). Under the terms of the settlement, we have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $10 million over a
period of seven years; $3 million of which is to be paid within approximately four months of the settlement date, after which, interest
will accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate of 6%, compounded annually. A partial payment of $150,000 has been made towards the initial
$3 million payment and the due date for the remainder of the initial payment was extended to January 2023 in exchange for $105,000 in
extension fees paid through the date of this filing and an additional $230,000 in forbearance fees which are to be paid with the final
installment of all accrued interest in approximately March 2030. The extension and forbearance fees have been classified as additional
interest in the accompanying financial statements. All amounts, including all accrued interest, are to be paid no later than eight years
from the date of the initial payment. The Kopple Parties have also received seven-year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately
3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.85 per share. The settlement also provides for standard mutual general release
provisions and includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including certain increases in the amount payable to the
Kopple Parties and the right of such parties to enter judgment against the Company if the Company remains in uncured default in its payment
obligations under the settlement.
In Fiscal 2019, we effectuated a one-for-seven
reverse stock split and began increasing our engineering and manufacturing activities.
23
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis
of our financial conditions and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best
estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience
and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and cannot be reasonably
estimated for these key estimates and assumptions. However, we made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances
available as of the reporting date. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial
statements may be materially affected.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue, net of discounts, for our generator sets at
time of product delivery to the domestic distributor (i.e. point-in-time), which also corresponds to the passage of legal title to the
customer and the satisfaction of our performance obligations to the customer.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or net realizable value, on an average cost basis. We review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess or
obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. When evidence exists that the net realizable value of inventory is lower
than its cost, the difference is recognized as a loss in the period in which it occurs. Once inventory has been written down, it creates
a new cost basis for inventory that may not be subsequently written up.
Leases
The Company determines whether a contract is,
or contains, a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease
term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based upon the estimated present value of unpaid lease payments over the lease
term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement in determining the present
value of unpaid lease payments.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants, and shares of common stock to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized
as expense over the requisite service period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner
as if the Company had paid cash for services. The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants, and shares of common stock
to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. Share-based compensation cost
is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service
period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments
that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation
methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. The Company’s
derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded
in the statement of operations.

Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected
the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets in the
global financial markets. We began to see the impact of COVID-19 during our fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 with our Chinese joint venture’s
manufacturing facilities being required to close and many of our customers suspending their own operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, net sales and production levels during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, the entirety of Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2022 and the
first three quarters of Fiscal 2023 were significantly reduced, thus impacting our results of operations during these quarters.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and business
disruption, we implemented certain measures to manage costs, preserve liquidity and enhance employee safety. These measures included
the following:
●
Reduction of payroll costs
through temporary furloughs;
●
Enhanced cleaning and disinfection
procedures at our facilities, temperature checks for our workers, promotion of social distancing at our facilities and requirements
for employees to work from home where possible;
●
Reduction of capital expenditures;
and
●
Deferral of discretionary
spending.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business, financial results and liquidity will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of
the COVID-19 outbreak within the U.S. and globally, the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on our customers,
especially in the commercial vehicle markets. These future developments are outside of our control, are highly uncertain, and cannot
be predicted. If the impact is prolonged, then it can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may require us to
take further actions as it relates to costs and liquidity. These and other potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely
impacted our results for the entirety of Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022, the first three quarters of fiscal year 2023, and could be impactful
for the balance of Fiscal 2023.
Going Concern
During the nine-month period ended November 30, 2022, the Company reported
a net loss of approximately $2,582,000, and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2,254,000, and at November 30, 2022, had
a stockholders’ deficit of approximately $20.2 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s February 28, 2022, financial statements, raised substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
In the event the Company is unable to generate
profits and is unable to obtain financing for its working capital requirements, it may have to curtail its business further or cease
business altogether. Substantial additional capital resources will be required to fund continuing expenditures related to our research,
development, manufacturing and business development activities. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to retain its current financing, to obtain additional
financing, and ultimately to attain profitability.
25
During the next twelve months we intend to continue
to attempt to increase the Company’s operations and focus on the sale of our AuraGen®®/VIPER products both domestically
and internationally and to add to our existing management team. In addition, we plan to source new suppliers for manufacturing operations,
rebuild the engineering and sales teams, and to the extent appropriate, utilize third party contractors to support the operation. We
anticipate being able to obtain new sources of funding to support these actions in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2023 and in the
upcoming fiscal year.
Results of Operations
Three months ended November 30, 2022 compared
to three months ended November 30, 2021
Net revenue was approximately $53,800 for the
three-months ended November 30, 2022 (“Fiscal Q3 2023”) compared to approximately $58,400 for the three-months ended November
30, 2021 (“Fiscal Q3 2022”). During Fiscal Q3 2023, we delivered 7 generator units and 2 other ECU units as compared to 3
generator/ECU systems delivered in the same quarter in the prior year. Revenues continue to be negatively impacted by both the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as a generally low level of resources. We cannot project with confidence the timing or amount of revenue that we can
expect despite improvements in the pandemic being under more control globally including a successful rollout of the vaccine programs.
To increase revenues which were impacted by the economic effects of the pandemic, the Company needs to augment its marketing and sales
efforts substantially. As the Company’s focus has been on new product engineering and development, the current limited resources
prevent executing the increased selling efforts in the near term.
Cost of goods sold was approximately $26,000
in Fiscal Q3 2023 compared to approximately $58,000 in Fiscal Q3 2022. This resulted in a gross profit of approximately $27,700, or a
gross margin of 52%, and approximately $300 gross profit or essentially breakeven, in Fiscal Q3 2023 and Fiscal Q3 2022, respectively.
The almost zero gross profit and breakeven margin in the Fiscal Q3 2022 period was largely influenced by the low volume of shipments
which reduced our ability to fully absorb fixed operating costs including higher operating costs related to the new facility. The Fiscal
Q3 2023 period showed improvement in gross profit as the production volume has started to increase somewhat and the non-production time
of the operations team was redirected to research and development related activities.
Engineering, research and development expenses
were approximately $229,000 in Fiscal Q3 2023, compared to approximately $208,000 in the Fiscal Q3 2022 period, or an increase of 10%.
Fiscal Q3 2023 reflects an augmented development program as compared to Fiscal Q3 2022 for the engineering of several new product designs,
as well as increased testing, including increased staffing costs of approximately $44,000 and software costs licensing costs of approximately
$25,000. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in recruiting expenses, as Fiscal Q3 2022 included the acquisition cost
of the new Chief Scientist.
Selling, general and administration (“SG&A”)
expense decreased by approximately $122,700 or 16% to approximately $622,300 in the Fiscal Q3 2023 period from approximately $745,100
in the Fiscal Q3 2022 period. The decrease during Fiscal Q3 2023 was principally associated with the reduction of approximately $163,200
in share-based compensation costs related to the vesting options granted in Fiscal 2021, reduction of public relations marketing expense
of approximately $73,500 and a reduction of approximately $44,400 in legal expenses. These decreases in expenses were partially offset
by a (i) increased salary and fringe benefit expenses of approximately $92,000, including the addition of the Company’s Chief Financial
Officer, (ii) higher expenses of approximately $49,000 occupancy and equipment related expenses, (iii) higher accounting fees of approximately
$10,700 related to the review of the Company’s financial statements for filing the 10-Q for Fiscal Q2 2023, and (iv) an overall
net increase of approximately $6,100 in all other selling and administrative expenses as compared to the Fiscal Q3 2022 period. .
Interest expense in Fiscal Q3 2023 decreased
approximately $10,600 or 4%, to approximately $260,300 from approximately $270,900 in the Fiscal Q3 2022 period. The reduction in interest
expense in Fiscal Q3 2022 principally reflects a change in the interest amount recorded due to the settlement of the Kopple litigation.
Fiscal Q3 2022 included approximately $205,200 in interest expense on the Kopple notes that were being disputed. The settlement of the
Kopple litigation resulted in the conversion of the Kopple notes payable into a new note, which does not begin to accrue interest until
payment of the initial $3.0 installment. The payment date was extended and is to be paid by November 2022. The extension fee of $30,000
paid in Fiscal Q3 2022 and the accrued but unpaid forbearance fee of $130,000 were classified as additional interest, resulting in approximately
$45,200 lower interest expense related to the Kopple notes as compared to Fiscal Q3 2022. (See Note 15 and Part II- Item 3 –
Legal
Proceedings ). The overall reduction in interest was partially offset by approximately $41,700 of interest recorded for overdue accounts
payable and equipment loans.
Other expense in the Fiscal Q3 2023 period was
approximately $180,500 which represents the unfavorable change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability for the three-months,
measured as of November 30, 2022. Comparatively, the revaluation of the derivative warrant liability in Fiscal Q3 2022, measured as of
November 30, 2021, resulted in an unfavorable change in the fair value of approximately $734,100 for the three-month period.
26
Net loss for the three-month period of Fiscal
Q3 2023 decreased by approximately $693,400, to a loss of approximately $1,264,200 from a restated net loss of approximately $1,957,400
in the three-month period of Fiscal Q3 2022. This was attributed to (i) reduction of the net loss related to derivative liability valuation
of approximately $553,600, (ii) less interest expense of approximately $10,600, and (iii) the decreased operating loss of approximately
$129,200.
Nine months ended November 30, 2022 compared
to nine months ended November 30, 2021
Net revenue was approximately $70,400 for the
nine-months ended November 30, 2022 (“Fiscal YTD 2023”) compared to approximately $84,500 for the nine-months ended November
30, 2021 (“Fiscal YTD 2022”). During Fiscal YTD 2023, we delivered 7 generator units and 3 other ECU units as compared to
4 generator/ECU systems delivered and 2 other ECU units in the same nine-month period in the prior year. Revenues continue to be negatively
impacted by both the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a generally low level of resources. We cannot project with confidence the timing or
amount of revenue that we can expect despite improvements in the pandemic being under more control globally including a successful rollout
of the vaccine programs. To increase revenues which were impacted by the economic effects of the pandemic, the Company needs to augment
its marketing and sales efforts substantially. As the Company’s focus has been on new product engineering and development, the
current limited resources prevent executing the increased selling efforts in the near term.
Cost of goods sold was approximately $55,800
in Fiscal YTD 2023 compared to approximately $154,300 in Fiscal YTD 2022. This resulted in a gross profit of approximately $14,600, or
a gross margin of 21%, and approximately $69,700 gross loss and a gross margin loss of 83%, in Fiscal YTD 2023 and Fiscal YTD 2022, respectively.
The gross loss and related gross margin loss for Fiscal YTD 2022 was largely influenced by the low volume of shipments in each quarter
which reduced our ability to fully absorb fixed operating costs including higher operating costs related to the new facility. The Fiscal
YTD 2023 period showed improvement resulting in a modest gross profit as the production volume has started to increase somewhat and more
importantly, the non-production time of the operations team was redirected to research and development related activities as the Company
has focused more on the development and testing of new designs in Fiscal YTD 2023.
Engineering, research and development expenses
were approximately $639,700 in Fiscal YTD 2023, compared to approximately $370,600 in the Fiscal YTD 2022, or an increase of 73%. During
Fiscal 2022, the Company began to see higher level of R&D expenses than several of the prior years as the Company restarted its new
product development program beginning with the development of a new electronic control unit (“ECU”). Fiscal YTD 2023 reflects
the continuation of the increased development program, including additional staffing costs for the engineering team, analytical software
program costs for engineering several new designs as well as increased testing.
Selling, general and administration (“SG&A”)
expense increased by approximately $76,300 or 4% to approximately $2,028,500 in the Fiscal YTD 2023 period from approximately $1,952,200
in the Fiscal YTD 2022 period. The modest increase during Fiscal YTD 2023 was due to several offsetting factors, including (i) higher
legal costs of $134,700 primarily related to the settlement of the Kopple litigation and a complaint related to the Company’s former
Chief Executive Officer, Mel Gagerman, (ii) additional salary other wage-related expenses of approximately $329,600, including the addition
of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, (iii) higher accounting fees of approximately $67,500 related to the audit and review
of the Company’s financial statements for filing the 10-K for Fiscal 2022 and the 10-Q reports for Fiscal Q1and Q2 2023, (iv) occupancy
costs and amortization of newly acquired equipment and related software expenses of $67,200, and (v) an overall net increase of approximately
$40,400 in all other selling and administrative expenses as compared to the Fiscal YTD 2022 period. These increased expenses were partially
offset by a reduction of approximately $489,600 in share-based compensation costs related to the vesting options granted in Fiscal 2021
and a reduction of public relations marketing expense of approximately $73,500.
Interest expense in Fiscal YTD 2023 decreased
approximately $443,800 or 48%, to approximately $489,100 from approximately $932,900 in the Fiscal YTD 2022 period principally due to
(i) Fiscal YTD 2022 including an approximately $56,700 interest accrual related to the settlement with a former employee (See Note 15),
(ii) Fiscal YTD 2022 including an approximately $68,000 interest accrual for unpaid accounts payable to a related party, and (iii) the
settlement of the Kopple litigation which resulted in the conversion of the Kopple notes payable into a new note. The new note does not
begin to accrue interest until payment of the initial $3.0 installment, which was extended and to be paid by November 2022. The extension
fees of $75,000 paid through November 30, 2022 and the accrued but unpaid forbearance fee of $130,000 were classified as additional interest,
resulting in approximately $414,900 lower interest expense related to the Kopple notes as compared to Fiscal YTD 2022 (See Note 15 and
Part II- Item 3 –
Legal Proceedings ). Partially offsetting those reductions in expense, Fiscal YTD 2023 included approximately
$95,800 of interest expense on outstanding accounts payable and equipment loans.
Other income in the Fiscal YTD 2023 period was
approximately $560,300 which represents the favorable change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability for the nine-months,
measured as of November 30, 2022. Comparatively, the revaluation of the derivative warrant liability in Fiscal YTD 2022, measured as
of November 30, 2021, resulted in an unfavorable change in the fair value of approximately $594,700 for the nine-month period. Fiscal
YTD 2022 also included a gain on the extinguishment of derivative liability of $44,620 associated with warrants that expired during the
nine-month period. In addition, Fiscal YTD 2022 included an approximately $75,100 gain on extinguishment of debt in connection with the
forgiveness of 100% of the principal and accrued interest related to the initial PPP loan obtained by the Company in April 2020.
27
Net loss for the nine-month period of Fiscal
YTD 2023 decreased by approximately $1,213,700, to a loss of approximately $2,582,400 from a restated net loss of approximately $3,796,000
in the nine-month period of Fiscal YTD 2022. This was attributed to (i) additional net gain related to derivative liability valuation
of approximately $1,155,000 and (ii) less interest expense of approximately $443,800, which were partially offset by (i) increased operating
loss of $261,100 and (ii) a $75,100 gain on forgiveness of debt, and (iii) an approximately $4,300 gain on debt settlement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the nine-month period ended November 30, 2022, the Company reported
a net loss of approximately $2,582,400, and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2,254,000, and at November 30, 2022, had
a stockholders’ deficit of approximately $20.2 million. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue
as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s February 28, 2022, audited financial statements,
raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The net loss of approximately $2,582,400 in the
nine-month period ended November 30, 2022 as compared to the nine-month period ended November 30, 2021 restated net loss of approximately
$3,796,000 was due to the first nine months of Fiscal 2023 having a significantly higher non-cash benefit from the change in fair value
of the derivative warrant liability and substantially lower interest expense, partially offset by an increased operating loss, as noted
above. A significant factor in both periods contributing to the negative operating cash flows is the low level of operating activities
caused principally by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional
capital and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global
financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, and our future prospects.
At November 30, 2022, we had cash of approximately
$220,300, compared to cash of approximately $150,200 at February 28, 2022. Subsequent to November 30, 2022, the Company issued 442,424
shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $146,000. Working capital deficit at November 30, 2022 was a $12.6
million deficit as compared to an $21.7 million deficit at February 28, 2022. The primary reason for the decrease in the deficit was
the reclassification of approximately $8.1 million in notes payable-related party, including accrued interest, related to Kopple from
current liabilities to long-term. The reclassification resulted from the Company reaching an agreement with Mr. Robert Kopple, a related
party note holder, to resolve all litigation between the parties related to notes payable and accrued interest carried at a value of
$12.1 million as of February 28, 2022. At November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, we had no accounts receivable.
Prior to Fiscal 2020, in order to maintain liquidity,
we relied upon external sources of financing, principally equity financing and private indebtedness. We have no bank line of credit and
will require additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations. Based on a cash flow analysis performed by management, we
estimate that we will need an additional $5 million to maintain existing operations for Fiscal 2023 and increase the volume of shipments
to customers. We cannot assure the reader that additional financing will be available nor that the commercial targets will be met in
the amounts required to keep the business operating. The issuance of additional shares of equity in connection with such financing could
dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, and such dilution could be substantial. If we cannot raise the needed funds, we would
also be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement
our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company.
In March 2022, the Company reached a settlement
with the Kopple Parties that resolves all claims asserted against the Company without any admission, concession or finding of any fault,
liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Company. Under the terms of the settlement, we have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $10
million over a period of seven years; $3 million of which was originally to be paid in June 2022, and subsequently extended to January
2023, after which, interest will accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate of 6%, compounded annually. All amounts, including all accrued
interest, are to be paid no later than eight years from the date of the initial payment. The Kopple Parties have also received seven-year
warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.85 per share. The settlement
also provides for standard mutual general release provisions and includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including
certain increases in the amount payable to the Kopple Parties and the right of such parties to enter judgment against the Company if
the Company remains in uncured default in its payment obligations under the settlement. As of the date of this report, the Company has
not yet paid the full $3,000,000 installment due to Kopple; having only made a partial payment of $150,000 in June 2022.
28
We consider the transactions described above with Mr. Kopple to be
related party transactions.
See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and
“Part IV, Item 15, Note 19 to the Financial Statements” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on June 21,2022 for information regarding the dispute and settlement with Mr. Kopple regarding these transactions.
ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide disclosure under this Item 3.
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of May 31, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, management’s assessment identified the following material weaknesses in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting: (1) ineffective controls over transactions for debt issuances to provide for
review of all terms in a timely and accurate manner, to ensure reporting is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
and properly reflected in the financial results; and (2) ineffective controls over transactions for issuances of common stock, options,
and warrants to provide for review of all terms in a timely and accurate manner, to ensure reporting is in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and properly reflected in the financial results.
Remediation Plan
In an effort to remediate the identified material
weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of
measures:
We have increased our personnel resources and
technical accounting expertise within the accounting function with the hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer as disclosed on Form 8-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2022. We intend to hire one or more additional personnel for the finance
and accounting function which will provide the manpower to perform timely and complete reviews of debt and equity transactions consistent
with control objectives. The Company also plans to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to
establish a formal process to account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions. The process of preparing and implementing
these written policies and procedures began during the Company’s Fiscal 2023 second quarter, and continued into the Fiscal 2023
third quarter ended November 30, 2022. We plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2023.
The Company continues to remediate the findings
contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, issued on June 21, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There have been no other changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022, not previously identified in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and issued on June 21, 2022 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
29
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and
claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually
and in the aggregate and evaluates potential losses on such litigation if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.
However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company for
amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
In 2017, the Company’s former COO was awarded
approximately $238,000 in accrued salary and related charges by the California labor board. In August 2021, the Company reached a settlement
by which the Company agreed to pay approximately $330,000, representing the principal award plus accrued interest. As of the time of
this filing, the Company has paid approximately $187,000 toward the settlement amount. The remaining balance of approximately $171,000
is to be paid no later than March 1, 2023, and accrues interest of 10% per annum until paid.
Since July 2017 the Company has been engaged
in litigation with a former director, Robert Kopple, relating to more than $13 million and the current equivalent of the approximately
23 million warrants, exercisable for seven years at a price of $0.10 per share, which Mr. Kopple and his affiliated entities (collectively
the “Kopple Parties”) claimed should have been originally issued to them pursuant to various agreements with the Company
entered to between 2013-2016. In March 2022, the Company reached a settlement with the Kopple Parties that resolves all claims asserted
against the Company without any admission, concession or finding of any fault, liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Company. Under
the terms of the settlement, we have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $10 million over a period of seven years; $3 million of which
was originally to be paid in June 2022, and subsequently amended to extend the initial installment to January 2023, after which, interest
will accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate of 6%, compounded annually. All amounts, including all accrued interest, are to be paid no
later than eight years from the date of the initial payment. The Kopple Parties have also received seven-year warrants to purchase up
to an aggregate of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.85 per share. The settlement also provides for
standard mutual general release provisions and includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including certain increases
in the amount payable to the Kopple Parties and the right of such parties to enter judgment against the Company if the Company remains
in uncured default in its payment obligations under the settlement. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet paid the full
$3,000,000 installment due to Kopple; having made a partial payment of $150,000 in June 2022.
In March 2019, various stockholders of the Company
controlling a combined total of more than 27.5 million shares delivered signed written consents to the Company removing Ronald Buschur,
William Anderson, and Si Ryong Yu as directors of the Company’s Board and electing Cipora Lavut, David Mann and Dr. Robert Lempert
as directors in their stead.  These written consents represented a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock. Because of the refusal by not only the removed directors but also Aura’s prior management to recognize the legal
effectiveness of the consents, in April 2019 the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant
to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents. On July 8, 2019
the Court of Chancery entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong Yu
and William Anderson had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written
consent (b) Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann and Dr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding
stock acting by written consent, and (c) the Company’s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert
Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Versón, Jr. As a result of prior management’s unsuccessful opposition to this stockholders’
action filed in the Court of Chancery, such stockholders may be potentially entitled to recoup their litigation costs from the Company
under Delaware’s corporate benefit doctrine and/or other legal provisions. To date, no final determination has been made as to
the amount of recoupment, if any, to which such stockholders may be entitled.

In June 2022, Melvin
Gagerman, the Company’s former CEO and CFO whose employment with Aura was permanently terminated in July 2019, brought suit against
the Company for repayment of an allegedly unsecured demand promissory note in the principal amount of $82,000 which he claims was entered
into in April 2014 and bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Despite the fact that, based on Gagerman’s allegations, the note
was issued during a period when he was the Company’s CEO, CFO, Corporate Secretary and Chairman of Aura’s Board of Directors,
Gagerman has stated that he does not possess a copy of the alleged promissory note. The Company disputes that any amount is presently
owed to Gagerman and has filed a cross-complaint against him for, among things, conversion, violation of California Business& Professions
Code §17200, and various breaches of fiduciary duty that the Company believes Gagerman committed against Aura, including without
limitation, Gagerman’s actions in opposing the valid 2019 stockholder consent action.
