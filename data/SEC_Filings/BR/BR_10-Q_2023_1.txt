Contents NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge” or the “Company”) may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “assumes,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “we believe,” “could be,” “on track,” and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. In particular, information appearing under “Business,” “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include: • changes in laws and regulations affecting Broadridge’s clients or the services provided by Broadridge; • Broadridge’s reliance on a relatively small number of clients, the continued financial health of those clients, and the continued use by such clients of Broadridge’s services with favorable pricing terms; • a material security breach or cybersecurity attack affecting the information of Broadridge’s clients; • the potential impact and effects of the Covid-19 pandemic (“Covid-19”) on the business of Broadridge, Broadridge’s results of operations and financial performance, any measures Broadridge has and may take in response to Covid-19 and any expectations Broadridge may have with respect thereto; • declines in participation and activity in the securities markets; • the failure of Broadridge's key service providers to provide the anticipated levels of service; • a disaster or other significant slowdown or failure of Broadridge’s systems or error in the performance of Broadridge’s services; • overall market, economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on the securities markets; • the success of Broadridge in retaining and selling additional services to its existing clients and in obtaining new clients; • Broadridge’s failure to keep pace with changes in technology and demands of its clients; • competitive conditions; • Broadridge’s ability to attract and retain key personnel; and • the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures. There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the factors described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 which was filed with the United States of America (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 12, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”), for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause our actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the 2022 Annual Report. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law. 3 Table of

B.
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation . The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. and in accordance with SEC requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These financial statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest, entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP of the Company’s financial position on December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the results of its operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, its cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its changes in stockholders’ equity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable.
Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company changed reporting for segment revenues, segment earnings (loss) before income taxes, and segment amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property to reflect the impact of actual foreign exchange rates applicable to the individual periods presented. The presentation of these metrics for the prior periods provided in this Form 10-Q has been changed to conform to the current period presentation. Total consolidated revenues and earnings before income taxes were not impacted. Please refer to Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” and Note 16, “Interim Financial Data by Segment.” C.
Securities . Securities are non-derivatives that are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless management intends to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the end of the reporting period, in which case they are reflected in Other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are in entities over which the Company does not have control, joint control, or significant influence. Securities that have a readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value. Securities without a readily determinable fair value are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, such as subsequent capital raising transactions. Changes in the value of securities with or without a readily determinable fair value are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In determining whether a security without a readily determinable fair value is impaired, management considers qualitative factors to identify an impairment including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. 11 Table of
Contents D.
Use of Estimates . The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions and judgment that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as appropriate. NOTE 2.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU No. 2021-08”), which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2021-08 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2021-08 will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 3.
REVENUE RECOGNITION ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU No. 2014-09”) outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
12 Table of
Contents The Company’s revenues from clients are primarily generated from fees for providing investor communications and technology-enabled services and solutions. Revenues are recognized for the
two
reportable segments as follows: • Investor Communication Solutions —Revenues are generated primarily from processing and distributing investor communications and other related services as well as vote processing and tabulation. The Company typically enters into agreements with clients to provide services on a fee for service basis. Fees received for processing and distributing investor communications are generally variably priced and recognized as revenue over time as the Company provides the services to clients based on the number of units processed, which coincides with the pattern of value transfer to the client. Broadridge works directly with corporate issuers (“Issuers”) and mutual funds to ensure that the account holders of the Company’s bank and broker clients, who are also the shareholders of Issuers and mutual funds, receive the appropriate investor communications materials and the services are fulfilled in accordance with each Issuer’s and mutual fund’s requirements. Broadridge works directly with the Issuers and mutual funds to resolve any issues that may arise. As such, Issuers and mutual funds are viewed as the customer of the Company’s services. As a result, revenues for distribution services as well as proxy materials fulfillment services are recorded in Revenue on a gross basis with corresponding costs including amounts remitted to the broker-dealers and banks (referred to as “Nominees”) recorded in Cost of revenues. Fees for the Company’s investor communications services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis following the delivery of the services. The Company also offers certain hosted service arrangements that can be priced on a fixed and/or variable basis for which revenue is recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligation by delivering services to the client on a monthly basis based on the number of transactions processed or units delivered, in the case of variable priced arrangements, or a fixed monthly fee in the case of fixed price arrangements, in each case which coincides with the pattern of value transfer to the client. These services may be billed in a variety of payment frequencies depending on the specific arrangement.
• Global Technology and Operations —Revenues are generated primarily from fees for trade processing and related services. Revenue is recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligation by delivering services to the client. The Company’s arrangements for processing and related services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to its clients on a when and if needed basis (a stand ready obligation) with revenue recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations on a monthly basis generally in the amount billable to the client. These services are generally provided under variable priced arrangements based on volume of service and can include minimum monthly usage fees. Client service agreements often include up-front consideration in addition to the recurring fee for trade processing. Up-front implementation fees, as well as certain enhancements to existing technology platforms, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the service term of the contract which corresponds to the timing of transfer of value to the client that commences after client acceptance when the processing term begins. In addition, revenue is also generated from the fulfillment of professional services engagements which are generally priced on a time and materials or fixed price basis, and are recognized as the services are provided to the client which corresponds to the timing of transfer of value to the client. Finally, the Company generally recognizes license revenues from software term licenses installed on clients’ premises upon delivery and acceptance of the software license, assuming a contract is deemed to exist, and recognizes revenue attributed to the associated software maintenance and support obligation over the contract term. Software term license revenue is not a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. The Company uses the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize: Transaction Price The Company allocates transaction price to the individual performance obligations within a contract. If the contracted prices reflect the relative standalone selling prices
for the individual performance obligations, no allocations are made. Otherwise, the Company uses the relative selling price method to allocate the transaction price, obtained from sources such as the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar clients. If such evidence is unavailable, the Company uses the best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as pricing strategy and market factors. A significant portion of the Company’s performance obligations are generated from transactions with volume based fees and includes services that are delivered at the same time. The Company recognizes revenue related to these arrangements over time as the services are provided to the client. While many of the Company’s contracts contain some component of variable consideration, the Company only recognizes variable consideration that is not expected to reverse. The Company allocates variable payments to distinct services in an overall contract when the variable payment relates specifically to that particular service and for which the variable payment reflects what the Company expects to receive in exchange for that particular service. As a result, the Company generally allocates and recognizes variable consideration in the period it has the contractual right to invoice the client.
13 Table of
Contents As described above, our most significant performance obligations involve variable consideration which constitutes the majority of our revenue streams. The Company’s variable consideration components meet the criteria in ASU No. 2014-09 for exclusion from disclosure of the remaining transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations as does any contracts with clients with an original duration of one year or less. The Company has contracts with clients that vary in length depending on the nature of the services and contractual terms negotiated with the client, and they generally extend over a multi-year period.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a client, are excluded from revenue. Distribution revenues associated with shipping and handling activities are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and recognized as the related services or products are transferred to the client. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between client payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company has presented below its revenue disaggregated by product line and by revenue type within each of its Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations reportable segments.
Revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity the Company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. Event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the Company processes. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing and distribution of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as Matrix administrative services. 14 Table of

Contract liabilities represent consideration received or receivable from clients before the transfer of control occurs (deferred revenue). Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, contract assets decreased due to a decrease in software term license revenues, while contract liabilities increased due to the timing of client invoices in relation to the timing of revenue recognized. The Co mpany recognized $ 179.3

that was included in the contract liability balance as of June 30, 2022. NOTE 4.
WEIGHTED-AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the Company’s Net earnings by the basic Weighted-average shares outstanding for the periods presented. The Company calculates diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented date are exercised and restricted stock unit awards have vested. The computation of diluted EPS excluded
0.8
million options to purchase Broadridge common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and
0.7
million options to purchase Broadridge common stock for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
The computation of diluted EPS excluded less than

The results of operations of the business acquired by the Company are included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings since the respective date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to Goodwill.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no acquisitions.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were no material acquisitions.
NOTE 7.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1     Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2     Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 3     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments, as applicable, based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The fair values of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market; therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the table below. The following tables set forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, that are recorded at fair value, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets: Other current assets:        Securities $ 0.6   $ —   $ —   $ 0.6   Other non-current assets:        Securities 127.7   —   —   127.7   Derivative asset —   97.0   —   97.0   Total assets as of December 31, 2022 $ 128.4   $ 97.0   $ —   $ 225.3   Liabilities:        Contingent consideration obligations —   —   12.0   12.0   Total liabilities as of December 31, 2022 $ —   $ —   $ 12.0   $ 12.0   17 Table of

Please refer to Note 14, “Contractual Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a further discussion. Deferred Client Conversion and Start-up Costs Deferred client conversion and start-up costs are direct costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with the Company’s technology. These costs are generally deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the service term of the arrangement to which the costs relate, which commences when the client goes live with the Company’s services. The key judgment for determining the amount of costs to be deferred relates to the extent to which such costs are recoverable. This estimate includes (i) projected future client revenues, including variable revenues, offset by an estimate of conversion costs including an estimate of onboarding costs as well as ongoing operational costs, and (ii) an estimate of the expected client life. This is also the basis for which the Company assesses such costs for impairment.
The two main categories of assets comprising Deferred client conversion and start-up costs of $ 1,437.9
million as of December 31, 2022 consisted of costs incurred to set-up or convert a client’s systems to function with the Company’s technology of $ 1,423.4
million, as well as other start-up costs of $ 14.5
million. Deferred client conversion and start-up costs of $ 1,232.3

The Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain covenants, including a leverage ratio. At December 31, 2022, the Company is in compliance with all covenants of the Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.
20 Table of
Contents Fiscal 2021 Term Loans:
In March 2021, the Company entered into a term credit agreement, as amended on December 23, 2021 (“Term Credit Agreement”), providing for term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.55  billion, comprised of a $ 1.0  billion tranche (“Tranche 1”), and a $ 1.55  billion tranche (“Tranche 2,” together with Tranche 1, the “Fiscal 2021 Term Loans”). The Company borrowed the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans in May 2021 in order to finance the Itiviti acquisition. Once borrowed, amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of such Fiscal 2021 Term Loans may not be reborrowed. The Tranche 1 Loan was to mature on the date that is
18
months after the date on which the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans were borrowed (the “Funding Date”), but was repaid in full in May 2021 with proceeds from the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes (as discussed further below). The Tranche 2 Loan will mature in May 2024 on the third anniversary of the Funding Date. The proceeds of the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans were used by the Company to solely finance the acquisition of Itiviti and pay certain fees and expenses in connection therewith. The Tranche 2 Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.875 % per annum (subject to step-ups to LIBOR plus
1.250 % or a step-down to LIBOR plus
0.750 % based on ratings). The Company may voluntarily prepay the Tranche 2 Loan in whole or in part and without premium or penalty. In the event of receipt of cash proceeds by the Company or its subsidiaries from certain incurrences of indebtedness, certain equity issuances, and certain sales, transfers or other dispositions of assets, the Company will be required to prepay outstanding Loans, subject to certain limitations and qualifications as set forth in the Term Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement is subject to certain covenants, including a leverage ratio. At December 31, 2022, the Company is in compliance with all covenants of the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans. Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes:
In June 2016, the Company completed an offering of $ 500.0
million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes”). The Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes will mature on June 27, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of
3.40 % per annum. Interest on the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 27 and December 27 of each year. The Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes were issued at a price of
99.589 % (effective yield to maturity of
3.449 %). The indenture governing the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes contains certain covenants including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to create or incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, certain subsidiary indebtedness, and to engage in mergers or consolidations and transfer or lease of all or substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2022, the Company is in compliance with the covenants of the indenture governing the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes. The indenture also contains covenants regarding the purchase of the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event. The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their maturity. The fair value of the fixed-rate Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 468.8

(the “Broadridge SORP”). The Broadridge SORP is a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The Broadridge SORP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015. The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “Broadridge SERP”).

million. The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which the Company annually grants stock option and restricted stock unit awards. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the dates of grant, with the measurement of stock-based compensation expense recognized in Net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 20.9
million and $ 22.7
million, as well as related expected tax benefits of $ 4.8
million and $ 5.1
million were recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 36.5
million and $ 36.2
million, as well as related expected tax benefits of $ 8.3
million and $ 8.2
million were recognized for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock unit awards amounted to $ 9.1
million and $ 79.8
million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of
1.8
years and
1.8
years, respectively. For stock options granted, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company’s stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. 23 Table of

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Data Center Agreements In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provided certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provided a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022, but a
two-year
extension was signed in March 2015, amending the expiration date to June 30, 2024. In December 2019, the Company and IBM amended and restated the IT Services Agreement (the “Amended IT Services Agreement”), which now expires on June 30, 2027. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the Amended IT Services Agreement over time. The Company may renew the term of the Amended IT Services Agreement for up to
one
additional
12 -month period. On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into a novation agreement with IBM (the “U.S. Novation Agreement”) pursuant to which IBM novated the Amended IT Services Agreement to Kyndryl, Inc. (“Kyndryl”), an entity formed in connection with IBM’s spin-off of its managed infrastructure services business, effective September 1, 2021. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended IT Services Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $ 108.4
million through fiscal year 2027, the final year of the Amended IT Services Agreement.
In December 2019, the Company and IBM entered into an information technology agreement for private cloud services (the “Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks. The Private Cloud Agreement has an initial term of approximately 10 years and three months, expiring on March 31, 2030. As a result of the Private Cloud Agreement, the Company transferred certain of its employees in April 2020 to IBM and its affiliates, and such transferred employees are expected to continue providing services to the Company on behalf of IBM under the Private Cloud Agreement. Pursuant to the Private Cloud Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer the ownership of certain Company-owned hardware (the “Hardware”) located at Company facilities worldwide to IBM. The transfer of the Hardware and Maintenance Contracts to IBM closed on September 30, 2020 for a selling price of $ 18.0  million. On July 28, 2021, IBM novated the Private Cloud Agreement to Kyndryl, effective September 1, 2021, pursuant to the U.S. Novation Agreement. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Private Cloud Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $ 154.9
million through March 31, 2030, the final year of the contract. In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement would have expired in October 2023. In December 2019, the Company amended the existing EU IT Services Agreement whereby the Company will migrate from the existing dedicated on-premises solution to a managed Broadridge private cloud environment provided by IBM, as well as extended the term of the EU IT Services Agreement to June 2029 (the “Amended EU IT Services Agreement”). The Company has the right to renew the term of the Amended EU IT Services Agreement for up to
one
additional
12 -month period or
one
additional
24 -month period. On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a novation agreement with IBM UK pursuant to which IBM UK novated the EU IT Services Agreement to Kyndryl UK Limited, effective September 1, 2021. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $ 14.7
million through fiscal year 2029, the final year of the contract.

Contents Cloud Services Resale Agreement On December 31, 2021, the Company and Presidio Networked Solutions LLC (“Presidio”), a reseller of services of Amazon Web Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “AWS”), entered into an Order Form and AWS Private Pricing Addendum, dated December 31, 2021 (the “Order Form”), to the Cloud Services Resale Agreement, dated December 15, 2017, as amended (together with the Order Form, the “AWS Cloud Agreement”), whereby Presidio will resell to the Company certain public cloud infrastructure and related services provided by AWS for the operation, management and support of the Company’s cloud global distributed platforms and products. The AWS Cloud Agreement expires on December 31, 2026. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the AWS Cloud Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $ 204.5
million through December 31, 2026. Investments The Company has an equity method investment that is a variable interest in a variable interest entity. The Company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate the investee. The Company’s potential maximum loss exposure related to its unconsolidated investments in this variable interest entity totaled $ 40.1  million as of December 31, 2022, which represents the carrying value of the Company's investment.
In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has a future commitment to fund $ 0.9  million to one of the Company’s other investees. Software License Agreements The Company has incurred the following expenses under software license agreements: Three Months Ended   December 31, Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2022 (in millions) Software License Agreements $ 32.9   $ 35.9   $ 68.5   $ 67.8   Fixed Operating Lease Cost The Company has incurred the following fixed operating lease costs: Three Months Ended   December 31, Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2022 (in millions) Fixed Operating Lease Cost $ 10.1   $ 12.3   $ 20.4   $ 23.6   Litigation Broadridge or its subsidiaries are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business (referred to as “Litigation”). The Company establishes reserves for Litigation and other loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will occur, and the amount of such loss can reasonably be estimated. For certain Litigation matters for which the Company does not believe it probable that a loss will occur at this time, the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses in excess of established reserves. Management currently estimates an aggregate range of reasonably possible losses for such matters of up to $ 30  million in excess of any established reserves. The Litigation matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and it is reasonably possible that the actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. The Company’s management currently believes that resolution of any outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effects are recorded.

Contents Plan Management Corp. Claim
Paramount Financial Communications, Inc. d/b/a Plan Management Corp. (“Plan Management”) and Jonathan Miller filed a complaint on January 28, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Plan Management claimed that Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. (“BRICS”) breached a marketing agreement between BRICS and Plan Management (the “Marketing Agreement”) and Mr. Miller asserted a fraud claim. The case went to trial in the second fiscal quarter of the Company’s fiscal year 2023. The court dismissed Mr. Miller’s fraud claim and Plan Management’s breach of contract claim went to the jury. On December 7, 2022, the jury found that BRICS breached the Marketing Agreement and acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct. Plan Management has filed a motion for post-judgment interest, and Mr. Miller has filed a motion for a new trial on his fraud claim. BRICS has filed post-trial motions to vacate or overturn the verdict and will file an appeal if necessary. Based on the merits of those post-trial motions and in light of the facts and circumstances of the case at this time, the Company does not believe that a loss is probable in this matter.
Other It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. In January 2022, the Company entered into a series of cross-currency swap transactions which were designated as a net investment hedge against a portion of the Company’s net investment in its Euro functional subsidiaries.
In January 2022, the Company executed a series of cross-currency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of EUR
880  million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of its net investment in its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. The cross-currency swap derivative contracts are agreements to pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company’s U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt into Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. The cross-currency swaps mature in May 2031 to coincide with the maturity of the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income (loss), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s position on the cross-currency swaps was an asset of $ 97.0  million, and is recorded as part of Other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offsetting amount recorded as part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company has elected the spot method of accounting whereby the net interest savings from the cross-currency swaps is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
In May 2021, the Company settled a forward treasury lock agreement that was designated as a cash flow hedge, for a pre-tax loss of $ 11.0  million, after which the final settlement loss is being amortized into Interest expense, net ratably over the
ten year
term of the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes.
The expected amount of the existing loss that will be amortized into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately $ 1.1  million. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements. The Company’s business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by Broadridge Business Process Outsourcing, LLC (“BBPO”), an indirect subsidiary, which is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). Although BBPO’s FINRA membership agreement allows it to engage in clearing and the retailing of corporate securities in addition to mutual fund retailing on a wire order basis, BBPO does not clear customer transactions, process any retail business or carry customer accounts. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, BBPO is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At December 31, 2022, BBPO was in compliance with this net capital requirement. BBPO, as a “Managing Clearing Member” of the Options Clearing Corporation (the “OCC”), is also subject to OCC Rule 309(b) with respect to the business process outsourcing services that it provides to other OCC “Managed Clearing Member” broker-dealers. OCC Rule 309(b) requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At December 31, 2022, BBPO was in compliance with this net capital requirement. 26 Table of
Contents In addition, Matrix Trust Company, a subsidiary of the Company, is a Colorado State non-depository trust company and National Securities Clearing Corporation trust member, whose primary business is to provide cash agent, custodial and directed trustee services to institutional customers, and investment management services to collective

trust funds. As a result, Matrix Trust Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, when applicable, must be met. At December 31, 2022, Matrix Trust Company was in compliance with its capital requirements. NOTE 15.

INTERIM FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT The Company operates in
two
reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations. See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” for a further description of the Company’s reportable segments. The primary components of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense.
Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (“U.S.”). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.
Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company changed reporting for segment revenues, segment earnings (loss) before income taxes, segment amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, and Closed sales to reflect the impact of actual foreign exchange rates applicable to the individual periods presented. The presentation of these metrics for the prior periods provided in this Form 10-Q has been changed to conform to the current period presentation. Total consolidated revenues and earnings before income taxes were not impacted. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 in the 2022 Annual Report. 30 Table of
Contents Critical Accounting Policies In presenting the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. In management’s opinion, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2022 Annual Report. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the Company’s business and financial performance. These performance indicators include Revenue and Recurring revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”) of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, Free Cash flow, Recurring revenue growth constant currency, and Closed sales. In addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth, as defined below. Refer to the section “Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, Free Cash flow and Recurring revenue growth constant currency to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and an explanation for why these Non-GAAP metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these Non-GAAP metrics for operational and financial decision-making. Refer to the section “Results of Operations” for a description of Closed sales and an explanation of why Closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors. Revenues Revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. The Company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs. Revenues from fees are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. The level of recurring and event-driven activity the Company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. Event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the Company processes. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services. Recurring revenue growth represents the Company’s total annual revenue growth, less growth from event-driven and distribution revenues. We distinguish recurring revenue growth between organic and acquired: • Organic – We define organic revenue as the recurring revenue generated from Net New Business and Internal Growth. • Acquired – We define acquired revenue as the recurring revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. This type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.
Revenues and Recurring revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the Company’s ongoing operational performance. See “Results of Operations” as well as Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 31 Table of
Contents Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth The Company uses select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. Record Growth is comprised of stock record growth and interim record growth.
Stock record growth (also referred to as “SRG” or “equity position growth”)
measures the estimated annual change in positions eligible for equity proxy materials.
Interim record growth (also referred to as “IRG” or “mutual fund/ETF position growth”) measures the estimated change in mutual fund and exchange traded fund positions eligible for interim communications. These metrics are calculated from equity proxy and mutual fund/ETF position data reported to Broadridge for the same issuers or funds in both the current and prior year periods.
Internal Trade Growth represents the estimated change in daily average trade volumes for Broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on Broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates Broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations reportable segments, respectively. The key performance indicators for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, are as follows: Select Operating Metrics Three Months Ended   December 31, Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Record Growth    Equity positions (Stock records) 9  % 20  % 9  % 29  %    Mutual fund/ETF positions (Interim records) 6  % 12  % 10  % 13  % Internal Trade Growth 5  % 1  % 5  % 1  % Results of Operations The following discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. The Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: “Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property” and “Acquisition and Integration Costs” represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities, respectively. “Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses” are comprised of two major components: Real Estate Realignment Expenses, and Covid-19 Related Expenses. Real Estate Realignment Expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the Company’s leased facilities in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. Covid-19 Related Expenses are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the Company to protect the health and safety of Broadridge associates during the Covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to Company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses.
“Russia-Related Exit Costs” are direct and incremental costs associated with the Company’s wind down of business activities in Russia in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates.
32 Table of
Contents “Net New Business” refers to recurring revenue from Closed sales for the initial twelve-month contract period after which the client goes live with the Company’s service(s), less recurring revenue from client losses. “Internal Growth” is a component of recurring revenue and generally reflects year over year changes in existing services to our existing customers’ multi-year contracts beyond the initial twelve month period in which it was included in Net New Business.
“Recurring revenue growth constant currency” refers to our Recurring revenue growth presented on a constant currency basis to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The following definitions describe the Company’s Revenues: Revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity, in addition to distribution revenues. The level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: • Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. • Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. • Equity Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, mutual fund proxy revenues were 59% lower compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. During fiscal year 2022, mutual fund proxy revenues were 57% greater than the prior fiscal year. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as Matrix administrative services. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues. Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
Closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance. 33 Table of
Contents The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we reported Closed sales net of a 5.0% allowance adjustment. Consequently, our reported Closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. We assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance. Closed sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $65.4 million, a decrease of $16.9 million or 20%, compared to $82.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Closed sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are net of an allowance adjustment of $3.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
Closed sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $94.4 million, a decrease of $17.6 million or 16%, compared to $112.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Closed sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are net of an allowance adjustment of $5.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Recent Developments New SEC Rule on Tailored Shareholder Reports On October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted a rule modifying mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investor communications. The SEC rule requires that shorter summary documents, referred to as tailored shareholder reports, be distributed in lieu of long-form annual and semi-annual fund reports or notices of the availability of such reports, which the SEC had permitted under Rule 30e-3. The rule went into effect on January 24, 2023 and includes an 18-month transition period for implementation by mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, with a final compliance date of July 24, 2024. We are reviewing the full impact of the new rule, however we currently estimate a reduction in our annual Recurring revenues of approximately $30 million phasing in over fiscal years 2025 and 2026, assuming no offset from new services. See the risk factor titled “ Our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and, in turn, adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability. ” in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in the 2022 Annual Report.
Global Pandemic The Covid-19 pandemic continues to persist throughout the world including the U.S., India, Canada, Europe and other locations where we operate. The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, created significant financial market volatility, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in a significant number of deaths and infections worldwide. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have taken, and expect to continue to take, measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients. In fiscal year 2023 to date, there has not been a material impact as a result of Covid-19 on our consolidated revenues and pre-tax income. In addition, all of our production-related facilities remain operational and are continuing to provide ongoing services to our clients. Further, we have not experienced any significant supply-chain issues as our critical vendors have also remained operational and continue to meet their on-going service level requirements. We continue to engage with our clients to assist with their service demands, including our clients’ needs for any supplemental operational services and/or changes to existing service requirements in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. See the risk factor titled “ The Covid-19 pandemic may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial performance ” in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in the 2022 Annual Report. Conflict in Ukraine We are monitoring the events related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have been actively managing any exposure we may have through a cross-functional taskforce that includes members of our senior management. We have historically had a limited presence in Russia, and we have no presence in Ukraine. We do not store any client data in Russia. Prior to the conflict, we had approximately 280 associates in St. Petersburg, Russia who provided software development and support services for several of our GTO products, less than 2% of our total associates. We have historically provided services to a very small number of Russian entities and subsidiaries of Russian entities. The revenues from those services represented less than 0.1% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and our outstanding accounts receivable from these entities is de minimis. We are in the process of terminating and winding down these relationships and closing our operations in Russia. We are monitoring and believe we are in compliance with all global sanctions arising out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We have largely completed the steps to move the services provided in Russia to other locations in Europe and Asia. We have taken actions to enhance our information security defenses in response to the Ukraine conflict. We do not expect the Ukraine conflict and the actions we are taking in response to have a material impact on our core operations or financial results.

Recurring revenue growth constant currency (Non-GAAP) was 8%, driven by organic growth from a combination of growth in Net New Business in GTO and ICS and Internal Growth, primarily in our ICS business.
• Event-driven revenues decreased $27.2 million, or 42%, primarily due to the decrease in volume of mutual fund proxy communications. • Distribution revenues increased $13.5 million primarily driven by the impact of current year postage rate increase of approximately $20.0 million, partially offset by lower volume of ICS mutual fund communications. Total operating expenses .
Operating expenses decreased $5.7 million, or less than 1%, to $1,185.0 million from $1,190.7 million as a result of a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses more than offsetting the increase in cost of revenues: • Cost of revenues - The increase of $9.8 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects the impact of higher postage and distribution expenses in our Investor Communication Solutions segment of $10.1 million. • Selling, general and administrative expenses - The decrease of $15.5 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflects lower compensation expenses of $9.0 million, and lower technology-related expenses of $1.2 million.
Interest expense, net.
Interest expense, net was $34.1 million, an increase of $12.7 million, from $21.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $12.7 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowing costs, partially offset by savings from the Company’s cross-currency swap transaction.
Other non-operating expense, net.
Other non-operating expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.9 million, compared to other non-operating income, net of $4.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increased expense of $6.3 million was primarily due to higher net gains on investments in the prior year period. Provision for income taxes .
• Effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022: 20.0% • Effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021:

Recurring revenue growth constant currency (Non-GAAP) was 9%, driven by organic growth from a combination of growth in Net New Business and Internal Growth in both ICS and GTO.
• Event-driven revenues decreased $40.8 million, or 29%, primarily due to the decrease in volume of mutual fund proxy communications. • Distribution revenues increased $61.3 million primarily driven by the impact of current year postage rate increase of approximately $53.3 million. Total operating expenses .
Operating expenses increased $100.4 million, or 4%, to $2,380.8 million from $2,280.3 million as a result of an increase in both cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses: • Cost of revenues - The increase of $86.2 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects the impact of higher postage and distribution expenses in our Investor Communications Solutions segment of $65.0 million. • Selling, general and administrative expenses - The increase of $14.3 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher compensation expenses of $9.9 million, and higher technology related expenses of $4.8 million.
Interest expense, net.
Interest expense, net was $61.0 million, an increase of $17.0 million, from $44.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $17.0 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowing costs, partially offset by savings from the Company’s cross-currency swap transaction.

Analysis of Reportable Segments Broadridge has two reportable segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations. The primary component of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit. 38 Table of

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s results in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, Non-GAAP results have been presented. These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, Free cash flow and Recurring revenue growth constant currency. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results. The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation. 43 Table of
Contents Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share These Non-GAAP measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items, the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance. Depending on the period presented, these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items: (i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, (iii) Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses, (iv) Investment Gain, and (v) Russia-Related Exit Costs. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses are comprised of two major components: Real Estate Realignment Expenses, and Covid-19 Related Expenses. Real Estate Realignment Expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the Company’s leased facilities in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. Covid-19 Related Expenses are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the Company to protect the health and safety of Broadridge associates during the Covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to Company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses. Investment Gain represents a non-operating, non-cash gain on a privately held investment. Russia-Related Exit Costs are direct and incremental costs associated with the Company’s wind down of business activities in Russia in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates.
We exclude Acquisition and Integration Costs, Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses, the Investment Gain, and Russia-Related Exit Costs from our Adjusted Operating income (as applicable) and other adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods, as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance. We also exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the Company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. Furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Although we exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Free Cash Flow In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software. Recurring revenue growth constant currency As a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The exclusion of the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our Recurring revenue growth, or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis,” is a Non-GAAP measure. We believe that excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our Recurring revenue growth provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods.

Contents Changes in Recurring revenue growth expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.              Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited) Three Months Ended   December 31, Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) (in millions) Operating income (GAAP) $ 107.9 $ 68.9 $ 195.4 $ 172.1 Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property 53.7 62.5 109.5 131.2        Acquisition and Integration Costs 3.7 7.8 7.7 10.7        Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses (a) — 1.7 — 3.5        Russia-Related Exit Costs (c) 7.9 — 10.5 — Adjusted Operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 173.1 $ 140.8 $ 323.2 $ 317.5 Operating income margin (GAAP) 8.3  % 5.5  % 7.6  % 7.0  % Adjusted Operating income margin (Non-GAAP) 13.4  % 11.2  % 12.5  % 12.9  % Three Months Ended   December 31, Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) (in millions) Net earnings (GAAP) $ 57.5  $ 47.2  $ 108.0  $ 114.4  Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property 53.7  62.5  109.5  131.2         Acquisition and Integration Costs 3.7  7.8  7.7  10.7         Real Estate Realignment and Covid-19 Related Expenses (a) —  1.7  —  3.5         Investment Gain —  (7.5) —  (7.5)        Russia-Related Exit Costs (c) 6.8  —  9.3  —              Subtotal of adjustments 64.1  64.4  126.6  137.8         Tax impact of adjustments (d) (13.2) (14.3) (26.4) (28.7) Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 108.4  $ 97.3  $ 208.2  $ 223.5  45 Table of

Contents We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. However, while we may do so at a future date, the Company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows: Expiration Date Principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2022 Carrying value at December 31, 2022 Carrying value at June 30, 2022 Unused Available Capacity Fair Value at December 31, 2022 (in millions) Long-term debt Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility:        U.S. dollar tranche April 2026 $ 335.0  $ 335.0  $ 25.0  $ 765.0  $ 335.0         Multicurrency tranche April 2026 —  —  —  400.0  —               Total Revolving Credit Facility 335.0  335.0  25.0  1,165.0  335.0  Fiscal 2021 Term Loans May 2024 1,540.0  1,536.9  1,535.8  —  1,540.0  Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes June 2026 500.0  497.7  497.4  —  468.8  Fiscal 2020 Senior Notes December 2029 750.0  743.8  743.4  —  636.0  Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes May 2031 1,000.0  992.0  991.5  —  816.0               Total Senior Notes 2,250.0  2,233.5  2,232.3  —  1,920.8               Total debt $ 4,125.0  $ 4,105.4  $ 3,793.0  $ 1,165.0  $ 3,795.8  Future principal payments on our outstanding debt are as follows: Years ending June 30, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total (In millions) $ —  $ 1,540.0  $ —  $ 835.0  $ —  $ 1,750.0  $ 4,125.0  The Company has a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the “Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility”), which is comprised of a $1.1 billion U.S. dollar tranche and a $400.0 million multicurrency tranche. Under the Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, revolving loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euro, Yen, and Swedish Kronor initially bear interest at LIBOR, CDOR, EURIBOR, TIBOR and STIBOR, respectively, plus 1.015% per annum (subject to step-ups to 1.175% and step-downs to 0.805% based on ratings) and revolving loans denominated in Sterling initially bear interest at SONIA plus 1.0476% per annum (subject to step-ups to 1.2076% and step-downs to 0.8376% based on ratings). The Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility also has an annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility (subject to step-ups to 20.0 basis points and step-downs to 7.0 basis points based on ratings). In March 2021, the Company entered into a term credit agreement, as amended on December 23, 2021 (“Term Credit Agreement”), providing for term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2.55 billion, comprised of a $1.0 billion tranche (“Tranche 1”) and a $1.55 billion tranche (“Tranche 2,” together with Tranche 1, the “Fiscal 2021 Term Loans”). The Tranche 1 Loan was repaid in full in May 2021.
The Tranche 2 Loans will mature in May 2024 on the third anniversary of the Funding Date. The proceeds of the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans were used by the Company to solely finance the Itiviti Acquisition and pay certain fees and expenses in connection therewith.
Interest on the outstanding portion of the Fiscal 2021 Term Loans bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875% per annum (subject to step-ups to LIBOR plus 1.250% or a step-down to LIBOR plus 0.750% based on ratings).

Contents In June 2016, the Company completed an offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes”). Interest on the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 27 and December 27
of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. In December 2019, the Company completed an offering of $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2020 Senior Notes”). Interest on the Fiscal 2020 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 2.90%.
In May 2021, the Company completed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes”). Interest on the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 2.60%.
The Fiscal 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, Fiscal 2021 Term Loans, Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes, Fiscal 2020 Senior Notes and Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.

Cash Flows Six Months Ended   December 31, Change 2022 2021 $ (in millions) Net cash flows used in operating activities $ (81.4) $ (94.6) $ 13.2  Net cash flows used in investing activities (35.1) (53.9) 18.8  Net cash flows provided by financing activities 176.9  159.2  17.6  Effect of exchange rate changes on Cash and cash equivalents (5.0) (4.1) (0.9) Net change in Cash and cash equivalents $ 55.3  $ 6.6  $ 48.7  Free cash flow: Net cash flows used in operating activities (GAAP) $ (81.4) $ (94.6) $ 13.2  Capital expenditures and Software purchases and capitalized internal use software (33.1) (29.2) (3.9)      Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ (114.5) $ (123.8) $ 9.3  The decrease in cash used in operating activities of $13.2 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable collections as well as decreased client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by lower net earnings, as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $18.8 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by $13.3 million of acquisition activity in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $17.6 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily reflects higher net debt proceeds, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options compared to the prior year period. Seasonality Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. This has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.

Contents Contractual Obligations Data Center Agreements In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provided certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provided a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. In December 2019, the Company and IBM amended and restated the IT Services Agreement (the “Amended IT Services Agreement”), which now expires on June 30, 2027. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the Amended IT Services Agreement over time. The Company may renew the term of the Amended IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month period. On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into a novation agreement with IBM (the “U.S. Novation Agreement”) pursuant to which IBM novated the Amended IT Services Agreement to Kyndryl, Inc., an entity formed in connection with IBM’s spin-off of its managed infrastructure services business (“Kyndryl”), effective September 1, 2021. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended IT Services Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $108.4 million through fiscal year 2027, the final year of the Amended IT Services Agreement. In December 2019, the Company and IBM entered into an information technology agreement for private cloud services (the “Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks. The Private Cloud Agreement has an initial term of approximately 10 years and three months, expiring on March 31, 2030. As a result of the Private Cloud Agreement, the Company transferred certain of its employees in April 2020 to IBM and its affiliates, and that such transferred employees are expected to continue providing services to the Company on behalf of IBM under the Private Cloud Agreement. Pursuant to the Private Cloud Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer the ownership of certain Company-owned hardware (the “Hardware”) located at Company facilities worldwide to IBM. The transfer of the Hardware and Maintenance Contracts to IBM closed on September 30, 2020 for a selling price of $18.0 million. On July 28, 2021, IBM novated the Private Cloud Agreement to Kyndryl, effective September 1, 2021, pursuant to the U.S. Novation Agreement. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Private Cloud Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $154.9 million through March 31, 2030, the final year of the contract. In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement would have expired in October 2023. In December 2019, the Company amended the existing EU IT Services Agreement whereby the Company will migrate from the existing dedicated on-premises solution to a managed Broadridge private cloud environment provided by IBM, as well as extended the term of the EU IT Services Agreement to June 2029 (the “Amended EU IT Services Agreement”). The Company has the right to renew the term of the Amended EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month period or one additional 24-month period. On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a novation agreement with IBM UK pursuant to which IBM UK novated the EU IT Services Agreement to Kyndryl UK Limited, effective September 1, 2021. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $14.7 million through fiscal year 2029, the final year of the contract.
Cloud Services Resale Agreement On December 31, 2021, the Company and Presidio Networked Solutions LLC (“Presidio”), a reseller of services of Amazon Web Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “AWS”), entered into an Order Form and AWS Private Pricing Addendum, dated December 31, 2021 (the “Order Form”), to the Cloud Services Resale Agreement, dated December 15, 2017, as amended (together with the Order Form, the “AWS Cloud Agreement”), whereby Presidio will resell to the Company certain public cloud infrastructure and related services provided by AWS for the operation, management and support of the Company’s cloud global distributed platforms and products. The AWS Cloud Agreement expires on December 31, 2026. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the AWS Cloud Agreement at December 31, 2022 are $204.5 million through December 31, 2026. The Company has an equity method investment that is a variable interest in a variable interest entity. The Company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate the investee. The Company’s potential maximum loss exposure related to its unconsolidated investments in this variable interest entity totaled $40.1 million as of December 31, 2022, which represents the carrying value of the Company's investments.
In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has a future commitment to fund $0.9 million to one of the Company’s other investees. 50 Table of
Contents Other Commercial Agreements Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at December 31, 2022. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. In January 2022, we executed a series of cross-currency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of EUR 880 million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. The cross-currency swap derivative contracts are agreements to pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of our U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt into Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. The cross-currency swaps mature in May 2031 to coincide with the maturity of the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income (loss), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2022, our position on the cross-currency swaps was an asset of $97.0 million, and is recorded as part of Other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offsetting amount recorded as part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We have elected the spot method of accounting whereby the net interest savings from the cross-currency swaps is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
In May 2021, we settled a forward treasury lock agreement that was designated as a cash flow hedge, for a pre-tax loss of $11.0 million, after which the final settlement loss is being amortized into Interest expense, net ratably over the ten year term of the Fiscal 2021 Senior Notes.
The expected amount of the existing loss that will be amortized into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately $1.1 million. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our products and services. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.
