STAR ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL CORP.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022
NOTE 1 –
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Star Alliance
International Corp. (“the Company”, “we”, “us”) was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko
Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada, for the purpose of acquiring and developing gold
mining as well as certain other mining properties worldwide and environmentally safe technologies both in mining and other business areas.
NOTE 2 –
SIGNIFICANT AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations
for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of operations for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the
audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year, as reported in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, have
been omitted.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value
measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of
fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1:
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2:
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3:
Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity
of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments as the notes bear interest
rates that are consistent with current market rates.
8
The following table classifies the Company’s liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022:

NOTE 3 –
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 24,617,811
as of December 31, 2022. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
had a net loss of $ 9,559,411 , which did include $ 9,177,563
of non-cash expense incurred for the issuance of common stock for services,
loss on conversion of preferred stock and derivatives associated with convertible debt. We used $ 180,861
of cash in operating activities.
Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting
to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its
daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and
in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise
additional funds. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

ACQUISITIONS
On December 15, 2021, the Company signed
a definitive agreement to purchase
51 % of Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana SA. (“Commsa”) for $1,000,000 in cash
and 5,000,000 in restricted shares of common stock. In addition, the Company has agreed to provide up to $7,500,000 working capital to
expand the mining operations in a gold mining project (Rio Jalan Project) in Olancho state in the highlands of Central Honduras. This
transaction has become effective as of January 1, 2022.
This project, that runs along a 12.5
mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River, is a peaceful agrarian area, with only farmers and ranchers in the nearby five villages.
The environmental licenses have been
obtained and exploration is ongoing. The mines will be producing gold early in 2022 and will be expanded early next year. Local small
mining operations are producing a minimum of 250 to 300 oz of gold per site per month while losing approximately 50% of the recoverable
gold particles. Our expanded operations, using modern equipment and our new Genesis program, should result in up to a 98% rate of recoverable
gold, leading to significantly higher quantities of gold per site.
9
As an important part of this transaction,
STAR has agreed to continue the distribution of aid to the five local villages with 2% of mining profits per village to be used for expanded
school facilities, a medical center, college scholarships and a community center to be used by adults and kids alike. Additional projects,
beneficial to the community, may be considered in the future.
Gold resources are in excess of 1 million
oz. This estimate came from a limited appraisal of the area in which the mines are located. This acquisition become effective in January,
2022. The Company has issued to date
250,000
shares of Common stock and paid $ 75,000
towards the purchase price.
On May 9, 2022, a binding letter of
intent was signed for the acquisition of
51 % of NSM USA a Wyoming corporation that owns 100% of four lithium mines in West Africa. The
cost of these mines is $2 million, most of which is to be used for the growth of the four mines. These mines that are already producing
small amounts of Lithium will be greatly expanded with the purchase of equipment. This transaction is due to close early 2023 with full
production expected in the second quarter of 2023.
On May 11, 2022, a binding letter of
intent was signed for the acquisition of
51 % of NGM USA a Wyoming corporation that owns 100% of three gold mines in West Africa. The cost
of this acquisition is $2 million, most of which will be used for equipment and growth of the mines. This transaction is due to close
early 2023. All exploration work has been completed and production is anticipated to start in the second quarter of 2023.
On May 23, 2022, a binding letter of
intent was signed for the acquisition of
75 % of Magma International Inc. (“MII”). This acquisition for stock and cash will
result in MII owning the Intellectual property, Building, equipment and significant inventory as well as the know how to produce Barotex.
Mr. Lilo Benzicron the original inventor of this product will join MII as CEO and will be driving the innovation of new products for
MII.
On December 17, 2022, Star has completed
the purchase of the Barotex™ patent, trade mark, equipment and inventory. The operations will be run through a new subsidiary Magma
International, Inc. Star has an option to purchase the 76,000 square foot building, that is the Barotex manufacturing plant. The patent
is for a fiber known as “Barotex”. Barotex is manufactured from igneous rock, is seven times stronger than steel and stronger
than wood, aluminum, fiber glass, carbon fiber and Kevlar. It weighs 50% less than fiber glass and is impervious to chemicals and seawater

stock compensation expense.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $24,617,811 as of December 31, 2022. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
had a net loss of $9,559,411, which did include $9,177,563 of non-cash expense incurred for the issuance of common stock for services,
loss on conversion of preferred stock and derivatives associated with convertible debt. We used $180,861 of cash in operating activities.
Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Net cash used in operating activities was $180,861
during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $40,046 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. We had a loss on conversion
of preferred stock in the amount of $758,124.
Net cash provided by financing activities was
$111.225 and $43,550 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the current period we received $97,250 from
the sale of preferred stock. We paid $5,881 reducing notes payable to $113,335.
Over the next twelve months, we expect our principal
source of liquidity will be raised from the sale of stock.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
18
Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified the policies outlined
below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive
list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management's judgment in their application. The impact
and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management's Discussion and Analysis
or Plan of Operation where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Note that our preparation of the financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
This item is not applicable as we are
currently considered a smaller reporting company.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Limitations on the Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls
In designing and evaluating the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally,
in designing disclosure controls and procedures, Company management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures
Our CEO and CFO, have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in
timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings and ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief financial officer, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022, due to the material weaknesses as disclosed
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
Such officers also confirmed that there was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
19
