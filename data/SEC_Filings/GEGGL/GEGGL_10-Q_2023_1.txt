Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes which are normally included in the Company’s Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. These financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items or items discussed herein) that management believes are necessary to fairly state results for the interim periods presented. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results of operations.
Previously reported assets and liabilities related to our Durable Medical Equipment ( DME ) Business, primarily consisting of HC LLC and its subsidiaries, have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022. In addition, the historical results of the DME Business and related activity have been presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as discontinued operations. See Note 4 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.   Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. Included in these estimates and assumptions are items that relate to revenue recognition, depreciable lives of property and equipment, impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, fair value measurements including stock-based compensation and contingent consideration, estimates associated with the application of acquisition accounting, and the val ue of lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets. Although these and other estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, actual results could be different from these estimates. 9
Principles of Consolidation The Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, and operating results of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as subsidiaries in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. In most cases, a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate a variable interest entity ( VIE ) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and we are either obligated to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or we hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries are reported as a component of liabilities for mandatorily redeemable interests, temporary equity for contingently redeemable interests or permanent equity, separate from the Company’s equity. See Note 10 – Non-Controlling Interests and Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries. Results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interests are included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents consist primarily of exchange-traded money market funds. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions or the issuers of these investments to the extent the amounts on deposit or invested are in excess of amounts that are insured. 10

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
1,512,222
potential shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are not included in the diluted income (loss) per share calculation because to do so would be anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2021 , the Company had
10,139,031
shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of Convertible Notes and
2,778,261
potential shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards that are not included in the diluted income (loss) per share calculation because to do so would be anti-dilutive. 11
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an aggregate of
1,108,892
and
153,451
issued shares, respectively, that are subject to forfeiture by the employee at a nominal price if service milestones are not met. The Company does not account for such shares as being outstanding for accounting purposes since they are unvested and subject to forfeiture. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Current Expected Credit Losses.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which changes the impairment model for financial instruments, including trade receivables from an incurred loss method to a new forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical experience, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Reference Rate Reform.
In March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , and ASU 2021-01,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , which provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying US GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform on financial reporting due to the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) if certain criteria are met. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , extending the sunset date under Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024 to align the temporary accounting relief guidance with the expected LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of these ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements.
3. Forest Note and Transactions with JPM

The Company recognizes investment management revenue at amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for providing services to its customers. Investment management revenue primarily consists of fees based on a percentage of assets under management, fees based on the performance of managed assets, and administration and service fees. Fees are based on agreements with each investment product and may be terminated at any time by either party subject to the specific terms of each respective agreement.
15
Management Fees The Company earns management fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC, Monomoy Properties UpREIT, LLC, the operating partnership of Monomoy Properties REIT, LLC ( Monomoy UpREIT ) and other private funds managed by GECM (collectively, the
Funds ). The performance obligation is satisfied and management fee revenue is recognized over time as the services are rendered, since the Funds simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided as GECM performs services. Management fee rates range from
1.0 % to
1.5 %
of the management fee assets specified within each agreement and are calculated and billed in arrears of the period, either monthly or quarterly. Property Management Fees Under the Monomoy UpREIT investment management agreement, GECM is also entitled to
4.0 % of rent collected. These fees are collected monthly in arrears. Property management fee revenue is recognized over time as the services are provided. Incentive Fees The Company earns incentive fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC and Monomoy Properties II, LLC (a feeder fund of Monomoy UpREIT). Where an investment management agreement includes both management fees and incentive fees, the performance obligation is considered to be a single obligation for both fees. Incentive fees are variable consideration associated with the investment management agreements. Incentive fees are earned based on investment performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or high-water marks, in accordance with the terms of the respective investment management agreements. Incentive fees are typically
20 % of the performance-based metric specified within each agreement.
As of December 31, 2022 , there are
no
incentive fees earned under the investment management agreements for which it was probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur. Administration and Service Fees The Company earns administration fees based on the administration agreement GECM has with GECC whereby the investment vehicles reimburse GECM for costs incurred in performing certain administrative functions. This revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Administration fees are billed quarterly in arrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services and reflect agreed upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a single performance obligation for each investment vehicle that is a series of distinct services with substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are provided on a daily basis.
6. Related Party Transactions Related party transactions are measured in part by the amount of consideration paid or received as established and agreed by the parties. Consideration paid for such services in each case is the negotiated value. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, GECM, has agreements to provide administrative services and manage the investment portfolio for GECC, Monomoy UpREIT and other investment products. Under these agreements, GECM receives administration fees, management fees based on the managed assets (other than cash and cash equivalents) and rent collected, and incentive fees based on the performance of those assets. See Note 5 – Revenue for additional discussions of the fee arrangements. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, GEO GP, serves as the general partner of Great Elm Opportunities Fund I, LP ( GEOF ), a Delaware multi-series limited partnership. GECM serves as the investment manager of GEOF. As the general partner, GEO GP provides administrative services and oversees GECM’s management of the investment portfolio of GEOF. GECM also served as the managing member of Great Elm SPAC Opportunity Fund, LLC ( GESOF
or the
Consolidated Fund ), a Delaware limited liability company, and provided administrative services and managed the investment portfolio of GESOF.
16
The Company has determined that GEOF, each series of GEOF and GESOF are VIEs and that the criteria for consolidation were met for GESOF during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and three and six months ended December 31, 2021 . The operations of the Consolidated Fund are included in our consolidated financial statements. In July 2022, GESOF liquidated and the Company received a distribution of cash and equity investments, pending final dissolution of the Consolidated Fund. There are
no
consolidated funds as of
December 31, 2022. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details. The Company retained the specialized investment company accounting guidance under US GAAP with respect to the Consolidated Fund during the periods it was consolidated. As such, investments of the Consolidated Fund were included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and the net unrealized and realized gain (loss) on those investments was included as a component of other income on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Fund were included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, continuing operations. Additionally, the Company receives dividends from its investment in GECC and Monomoy UpREIT and earns unrealized gains and losses based on the mark-to-market performance of those investments. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements. The following tables summarize activity and outstanding balances between the managed investment products and the Company:

Outstanding receivables are included in receivables from managed funds in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company owns

shares of GECC (approximately
20.6 %
of the outstanding shares). Certain officers and directors of GECC are also officers and directors of GEG. Matthew A. Drapkin is a director of our Board and also the Chairman of GECC's Board of Directors, and Adam M. Kleinman is our President, as well as the Chief Compliance Officer of GECC. In October 2020, GECM entered into a shared personnel and reimbursement agreement with Imperial Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ICAM ). Jason W. Reese, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of ICAM. Costs incurred under this agreement relate to human resources, investment management, and other administrative services provided by ICAM employees, for the benefit of the Company, and are included in investment management expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 such costs were
$ 0.3
million
and
$ 0.7
million , respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 such costs were
$ 0.1
million and $ 0.3
million , respectively. 17
On August 31, 2021, the Company entered into a financial advisory agreement with Imperial Capital, LLC. The agreement included a retainer fee of $ 0.1
million which was paid in October 2021. In addition, the agreement included a success-based fee upon a sale of HC LLC. Upon completion of the Sale of HC LLC on January 3, 2023, a success fee of $ 0.7
million was paid to Imperial Capital, LLC. Jason W. Reese is the Co-Founder and Executive Member of Imperial Capital, LLC. See Note 3 - Forest Note and Transactions with JPM for details on the Forest Note and Investment in Forest.
7. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. US GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: ▪ Level 1:
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. ▪ Level 2:
Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. ▪ Level 3:
Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value.
These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. All financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and
no n-recurring basis have been segregated into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date.
The assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and
no n-recurring basis are summarized in the tables below:

The valuation techniques applied to investments held by the Company and by the Consolidated Fund varied depending on the nature of the investment. Equity and equity-related securities Securities traded on a national securities exchange are stated at the close price on the valuation date.
To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are
no t applied, they are classified as Level 1. Investments in private funds The Company values investments in private funds using net asset value ( NAV ) as reported by each fund’s investment manager.
The private funds calculate NAV in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,
Financial Services – Investment Companies , as of the valuation date. Investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 , investments in private funds primarily consisted of our investment in Monomoy UpREIT. Monomoy UpREIT allows redemptions annually with
90
days’ notice, subject to a
one-year
lockup from the date of initial inves tment, which are capped at
5 % of its NAV. As of
December 31, 2022, there were no unfunded commitments. Contingent consideration In conjunction with the acquisition of the Monomoy UpREIT investment management agreement, the Company entered into a contingent consideration agreement that requires the Company to pay up to $ 2.0
million if certain fee revenue thresholds are achieved during fiscal years ending June 30, 2023 and 2024. The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The key assumptions in applying the Monte Carlo simulation model as of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 included revenue forecasts,
volatility of
20.2 % and
19.6 %, respectively, and a discount rate of
8.25 % and
6.5 %, respectively. As of
December 31, 2022, the contingent consideration of
$ 1.2
million
was included within the current portion of related party payables and related party payables in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of June 30, 2022, the contingent consideration of
$ 1.1
million
was included within the related party payables in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 8 - Borrowings for additional discussion related to the fair value of our notes payable and other long-term debt. T he carrying value of all other financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values.

GEGGL Notes On June 9, 2022, we issued $ 26.9
million in aggregate principal amount of
7.25 % notes due 2027 (the
GEGGL Notes ), which included $ 1.9
million of GEGGL Notes issued in connection with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The GEGGL Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equal with all of our outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The unsecured notes are effectively subordinated, or junior in right of payment, to indebtedness under our Convertible Notes and any other future secured indebtedness that we may incur and structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries.
We pay interest on the GEGGL Notes on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. The GEGGL Notes will mature on
June 30, 2027 . The GEGGL Notes can be called on, or after, June 30, 2024. Holders of the GEGGL Notes do not have the option to have the notes repaid prior to the stated maturity date. The GEGGL Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $ 25
and integral multiples of $ 25
in excess thereof.
The GEGGL Notes include covenants that limit additional indebtedness or the payment of dividends subject to compliance with a net consolidated debt to equity ratio of
2 :1 . As of December 31, 2022 our consolidated debt to equity ratio is
1.22 :1.00.
9. Convertible Notes As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 , the total outstanding principal balance of convertible notes due on
February 26, 2030
(the

$ 37.0
million
and
$ 36.1
million , respectively, including cumulative interest paid in-kind. The Convertible Notes are held by a consortium of investors, including
$ 15.0
million
issued to certain related parties. Such Convertible Notes issued to related parties include:
▪ $ 6.9
million
issued to entities associated with Matthew A. Drapkin, including funds managed by Northern Right Capital Management, L.P. ( Northern Right ), a significant shareholder.
Mr. Drapkin, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of Northern Right. ▪ $ 7.4
million
issued to entities associated with Jason W. Reese, including funds managed by ICAM, a significant shareholder. ▪ $ 0.7
million
issued to entities associated with Eric J. Scheyer, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Convertible Notes accrue interest at
5.0 % per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31, commencing June 30, 2020, in cash or in kind at the option of the Company.
Each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes are convertible into
288.0018
shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to the terms therein, prior to maturity at the option of the holder. The Company may, subject to compliance with the terms of the Convertible Notes, effect the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes into shares of common stock, subject to certain liquidity and pricing requirements, as specified in the Convertible Notes. The embedded conversion feature in the Convertible Notes qualifies for the scope exception to derivative accounting in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging,
for certain contracts involving a reporting entity’s own equity. The Company incurred $ 1.2
million in issuance costs on the original issuance. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the
10 -year term and are netted with the principal balance on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs was
$ 0.8
million
and
$ 0.9

$ 0.4
million
and
$ 0.9
million , respectively, related to the Convertible Notes, inclusive of non-cash interest related to amortization of debt issuance costs.

HC LLC – Non-controlling interest classified as temporary equity The Company issued a
9.95 % common stock equity ownership in HC LLC.
The holder of the interest has board observer rights for the HC LLC board of directors, but no voting rights.
HC LLC has the right of first offer if the holder desires to sell the security and in the event of a sale of HC LLC, the holder must sell their securities (drag along rights) and has the right to participate in sales of HC LLC securities (tag along rights).
In addition, upon the seventh anniversary of issuance date, if (i) the holder owns at least 50% of the common shares issued to it at the closing of the transaction, (ii) an initial public offering of HC LLC has not commenced and (iii) the holder has not had an earlier opportunity to sell its shares at their fair market value, the holder has the right to request a marketing process for a sale of HC LLC and has the right to put its common shares to HC LLC at the price for such shares implied by such marketing process.
The Company also has the right to call the holder’s common shares at such price. The holder of the non-controlling interest is entitled to participate in earnings of HC LLC and is not required to fund losses. As the redemption is contingent upon future events outside of the Company’s control which are not probable, the Company has classified the non-controlling interest as temporary equity and its fair value on the date of issuance, adjusted for any earnings in HC LLC. Refer to Note 14 - Subsequent Events for details on the Sale of HC LLC to Quipt on January 3, 2023.
HC LLC – Non-controlling interest classified as permanent equity The Company issued a
9.95 % common stock equity ownership in HC LLC. The rights are consistent with the non-controlling interest classified as temporary equity, other than the holder not having a contingent put right.

Refer to Note 14 - Subsequent Events for details on the Sale of HC LLC to Quipt on January 3, 2023.
GEC GP – Non-controlling interest classified as permanent equity GEC GP owned the rights to the profit sharing agreement with GECM as well as an intercompany obligation under a senior secured note payable issued by Great Elm GECC GP Corp (the
GP Corp. Note ) in consideration for the assets acquired from MAST Capital Management, LLC. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company purchased the remaining shares of GEC GP. As of December 31, 2022 ,

20.0 % common stock interest in Forest in exchange for $ 2.7
million. A s of December 31, 2022 ,

In July 2022, the Consolidated Fund ceased operations and distributed its remaining assets to non-controlling interests in the total amount of $ 0.6
million. 23
Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries Forest Preferred Stock classified as a liability On December 29, 2020, Forest issued
35,010
shares of preferred stock in Forest with a face value of $ 1,000
per share at issuance ( Forest Preferred Stock ). The preferred shares provided for a
9 % annual dividend, which was payable quarterly. As the preferred shares were mandatorily redeemable by the Company at their face value of $ 1,000
per share on
December 29, 2027 , or at a
0 - 3 % premium decreasing over time based upon the occurrence of certain redemption events prior to December 29, 2027, the security was classified as a liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 2022. Following the Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest, there was no outstanding balance in respect to Forest Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2022.

During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized total stock-based compensation expense associated with all restricted stock and stock options of
$ 0.6
million
and
$ 1.4
million , respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized total stock-based compensation expense associated with all restricted stock and stock options of
$ 1.1
million
and
$ 1.7
million , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized compensation costs related to all unvested restricted stock awards and stock options totaling
$ 1.8
million . During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued compensation to certain employees in the form of GECC common shares to be settled with GECC shares currently held by the Company.
The total value of GECC shares awarded for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was
$ 0.4
million, of which $ 0.1
million
vested immediately, and the balance will vest annually pro-rata over a
three year
period. Related compensation expense was
$ 0.1
million
and
$ 0.2
million
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 , respectively.
12. Income Taxes As of June 30, 2022, the Company had net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $ 821
million. Following the Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest, the Forest entity ceased being part of our consolidated tax group and NOL carryforwards attributed to Forest generally became unavailable for the Company's use going forward.
The Company retained approximately $ 154
million of the federal NOL carryforwards available to the Company as of June 30, 2022. Of these, approximately $ 139
million of federal NOL carryforwards will expire from
2023
through
2025 . The approximately $ 15
million of federal NOL carryforwards generated in fiscal year 2018 or later can be carried forward indefinitely.
In light of the Company’s history of cumulative operating losses, the Company recorded a valuation allowance for all of its federal and state deferred tax assets, as it is presently unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities will be realized. 25
The Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA ) was enacted into law on August 16, 2022.
Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a
15 % corporate alternative minimum tax on "adjusted financial statement income" for applicable corporations and a
1 % excise tax on repurchases of stock.
These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.
We are in the process of evaluating the provisions of the IRA, but we do not currently believe the IRA will have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows or financial position when it becomes effective.
13. Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, the Company is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Company maintains insurance to mitigate losses related to certain risks. The Company is not a named party in any other pending or threatened litigation that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
14. Subsequent events On January 3, 2023, DME Holdings, along with the minority owners of HC LLC, entered into the DME Purchase Agreement with QHM Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Quipt, completing the Sale of HC LLC for $ 80.0
million, consisting of approximately $ 72.8
million in cash, $ 5.2
million of indebtedness assumed by Quipt and $ 2.0
million in shares of Quipt common stock based on the
20-day
volume-weighted average price of Quipt’s common stock for the period ending on and including the second business day prior to the closing of the transaction. After transaction costs and amounts distributed to non-controlling interests, cash proceeds to GEG and subsidiaries were $ 64.1
million, of which $ 19.7
million were used to repay the remaining balance of the Forest Note, including accrued interest, in full. On January 17,
the Company exercised the Put Option and sold the Investment in Forest for $ 26.5
million in cash.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
GEG is a publicly-traded, investment management company focused on growing a scalable and diversified portfolio of long-duration, permanent capital vehicles across corporate credit, specialty finance, real estate and other asset classes. GEG and its subsidiaries currently manage Great Elm Capital Corp. ( GECC ), a publicly-traded business development company, and Monomoy Properties UpREIT, LLC ( Monomoy UpREIT ), an industrial-focused real estate investment trust, in addition to other investments. The combined assets under management of these entities at December 31, 2022 was approximately $619.0 million. We continue to explore other investment management opportunities, as well as opportunities in other areas that we believe provide attractive risk-adjusted returns on invested capital. As of the date of this report, we have not entered into any binding commitments to make additional acquisitions or investments in any of these areas.
On January 3, 2023, GEG’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc., along with the minority owners of Great Elm Healthcare, LLC ( HC LLC ), entered into a purchase agreement with QHM Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Quipt Home Medical Corp ( Quipt ), to sell 100% of the outstanding membership interests in HC LLC to Quipt. The total consideration of $80.0 million consisted of approximately $72.8 million in cash, $5.2 million of indebtedness assumed by Quipt and $2.0 million in shares of Quipt common stock based on the 20-day volume-weighted average price of Quipt’s common stock for the period ending on and including the second business day prior to the closing of the transaction. The disposal group satisfied the criteria for presentation as held for sale and discontinued operations as of December 31, 2022, and as such we have recast our historically reported segment information to reflect our ongoing business as a single reportable segment and to remove the activity of discontinued operations.
On December 30, 2022, GEG and and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Elm FM Acquisition, Inc. ( FM Acquisition ), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the
Stock Purchase Agreement ) with J.P. Morgan Broker-Dealer Holdings Inc. ( JPM ) to sell 61 shares of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Forest Investments, Inc. ( Forest ) owned by FM Acquisition and GEG, which constitute 61% of the issued and outstanding shares of Forest’s common stock, to JPM for approximately $18.4 million in cash (the
Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest ).
In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, GEG, JPM and Forest entered into an amended and restated stockholders’ agreement (the
Stockholders Agreement ). Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, from January 17, 2023 until February 17, 2023, GEG had the right (the
Put Option ) to sell its remaining 19% interest in Forest ( Investment in Forest ) for its then fair market value. On January 17, 2023, the Company exercised the Put Option and sold the Investment in Forest for approximately $26.5 million in cash.
As of June 30, 2022, we had $821 million of net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
Following the Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest, GEG retained approximately $154 million of these NOL carryforwards, $131 million of which expire on June 30, 2023.
COVID-19
The Company has been closely monitoring, and will continue to monitor, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including new variants of COVID-19) on all aspects of its business. Given the fluidity of the pandemic, the Company cannot estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on its business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows at this time. However, the operational and financial performance of the Company's business may be significantly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and restrictions on travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain disruptions, labor difficulties and shortages, commodity inflation and elements of economic and financial market instability in the United States and globally. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.
27
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
These items are monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 we did not make material changes in our critical accounting policies or underlying assumptions as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as it relates to recurring transactions.
Previously reported assets and liabilities related to our Durable Medical Equipment ( DME ) Business, primarily consisting of HC LLC and its subsidiaries, have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022. In addition, the historical results of the DME Business and related activity have been presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as discontinued operations. See Note 4 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Following presentation of our DME Business as discontinued operations, the Company views its operations and manages its business as one operating segment, which is the business of investment management focused on growing a scalable and diversified portfolio of long-duration, permanent capital vehicles across corporate credit, specialty finance, real estate and other asset classes.

Revenue
Revenues for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $0.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to the Monomoy UpREIT management agreement acquired in May 2022.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. This increase was mainly attributable to costs associated with servicing the recently acquired Monomoy UpREIT management agreement.
28
Other Expenses and Income
Interest expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to interest on the 7.25% notes due in 2027 issued in June 2022 (the
GEGGL Notes ) and on the $6.3 million promissory note issued to Imperial Capital Asset Management, LLC in May 2022 (the
Seller Note ), of which $3.7 million remains outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 the Company recognized $34.2 million and $28.9 million of other income (net), comprised of gain on Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest in December 2022 of $10.5 million, unrealized gain on the investment in the remaining non-controlling (19%) interest in Forest of $24.4 million recognized in December 2022, and dividends and interest income of $1.4 million and
$2.9 million, respectively, partially offset by net realized and unrealized loss on investments of $22.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $1.0 million and $0.5 million of other expense (net), respectively, mainly attributed to net realized and unrealized loss on investments of $1.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, partially offset by dividends and interest income of $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, as well as net realized and unrealized gain on investments of our consolidated fund Great Elm SPAC Opportunity Fund, LLC ( GESOF ) of $0.2 million (during the three months ended December 31, 2021 only).
Income Taxes
We do not expect that we will owe any federal taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $821 million. Following the Sale of Controlling Interest in Forest, the Forest entity ceased being part of our consolidated tax group and NOL carryforwards attributed to Forest generally became unavailable for the Company's use going forward.
The Company retained approximately $154 million of the federal NOL carryforwards available to the Company as of June 30, 2022. Of these, approximately $139 million of federal NOL carryforwards will expire from 2023 through 2025. The approximately $15 million of federal NOL carryforwards generated in fiscal year 2018 or later can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Company assesses NOL carryforwards based on taxable income on an annual basis.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Cash flows used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $1.6 million. The adjustments to reconcile our net income from continuing operations of $20.2 million to net cash used in operating activities included add-backs for various non-cash charges, such as $19.7 million of realized loss on our investments, $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $0.6 million of depreciation and amortization, which was offset by deduction of $35.2 million of unrealized gain on our investments, $10.5 million of gain on sale of controlling interest in Forest in December 2022, and the net negative change in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 we also received $1.6 million attributed to sales of investments by GESOF. Cash flows provided by operating activities of our discontinued operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $2.9 million.
Cash flows used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $4.9 million. The net cash outflow was primarily the result of our net loss from continuing operations of $7.5 million, net negative change in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million, and $0.4 million in net purchases of investments within our Consolidated Fund. These outflows were partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $1.7 million in stock-based compensation, $1.2 million in unrealized loss on investments, $0.7 million in realized loss on investments, and $0.2 million related to depreciation and amortization. Cash flows provided by operating activities of our discontinued operations for the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $8.0 million.
29
Cash flows provided by investing activities of our continuing operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $14.7 million which is attributed to the proceeds from sale of controlling interest in Forest, net of cash sold, and contribution of $3.0 million into a portfolio fund in advance of the effective date of the underlying subscription agreement. Cash flows used in investing activities of our discontinued operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $4.1 million.

Cash flows provided by financing activities of our discontinued operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $0.6 million.
Cash flows provided by financing activities of our continuing operations for the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $41 thousand, while cash flows provided by financing activities of our discontinued operations for the same period were $0.5 million.
