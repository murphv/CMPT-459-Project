NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The interim financial statements for the six months ending January 31, 2023 are unaudited. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with requirements for unaudited interim periods and consequently do not include all disclosures required to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. In management's opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial statements are reflected in the interim periods included and are of a normal recurring nature. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Form 10-K, for the year ended July 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC") at www.sec.gov
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
COVID-19 Pandemic Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the company's financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 and could have an impact throughout fiscal year 2021. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government health officials have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions on public gatherings and other similar measures. As a result, the company and certain of the company's customers and suppliers temporarily closed locations beginning late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, continuing into the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company shut down the operations of its' Open Data Centers, LLC operations effective April 30, 2020. On May 5, 2020 and on February 26, 2021 the Company's 1stPoint Communications LLC subsidiary entered into two $ 88,097
notes payable to Bank of America, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP Loan") under the CARES Act. 1stPoint has met the requirements for Loan Forgiveness, and as of October 19, 2021, these notes have been forgiven by the Small Business Administration in accordance with rules of the CARES Act. The amounts of have been reflected as other income in the company's financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a
straight-line basis
over the useful lives of the assets. For furniture and fixtures, the useful life is
five years , Leasehold Improvements are depreciated over their respective lease terms. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company has not recognized any related impairment losses.
Indefinite lived intangible assets
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. The Company has not recorded any related impairment losses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company has not recorded any related impairment losses.
Revenue recognition
We adopted ASC 606 on August 1, 2018. Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract or agreement with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. Unearned revenues are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of the performance of the services. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of July 31, 2020, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Fair value measurements
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting management's assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities (including warrants) approximate fair value.
Consolidation of financial statements
Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is the parent company and sole shareholder of Hammer Wireless Corporation and its subsidiaries, 1stPoint Communications, LLC and its subsidiaries, which includes Shelcomm, Inc, Endstream Communications, LLC, American Network Inc., Hammer Wireless - SL, Ltd and HammerPay [USA], Ltd. The financial statements for Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are reported on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. It's subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd. and its former subsidiary Open Data Centers, LLC are discontinued and are considered discontinued operations. Open Data Centers, LLC was dissolved on December 30, 2020.
Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, "Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)". This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. At present this does not impact our financial statements, but may in the future if there is conversion of certain notes. Management will continue to evaluate if this impacts our financial statements.
No other accounting pronouncements are applicable.
11 HAMMER FIBER OPTICS HOLDINGS CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2023 (Unaudited)
NOTE 4 - GOING CONCERN
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has consistently sustained losses since its inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to increase revenues, adequately control operating expenses and receive debt and/or equity capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company intends to continue to address this condition by seeking to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt and/or the sale of equity until such time that ongoing revenues can sustain the business, at which time capitalization may be considered through other means.
NOTE 5 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Hammer Fiber Optics Investment Ltd ceased operations in the Atlantic County geographical market on October 31, 2018 when Verizon Communications, LLC terminated the spectrum lease agreement.

of recognized indefinite lived intangible assets, which consist of customer and supplier contract assets from acquisitions, intellectual property and goodwill. These assets are not amortized and are evaluated routinely for potential impairment. If a determination is made that the intangible asset is impaired after performing the initial qualitative assessment, the asset's fair value will be calculated and compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized.

The Company has approximately $ 23,339,000
of NOL carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. The tax laws enacted in 2017 also changed the treatment of NOL. Prior to the change, NOL could be carried back up to two years and carried forward up to 20 years to offset taxable income. In the new tax law, the NOL that can be carried forward is limited to 80% of the taxable income, can no longer be carried back, but are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. The new law will apply to NOL arising in tax years beginning December 31, 2017, hence, $ 3,000,000
of the NOL will be subject to the 80% limitation and will be carried forward indefinitely while $ 19,297,000
of the NOL will be carried forward for 20 years and will begin to expire in 2036.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as a tax expense.

Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into USD Dollars using the weighted-average exchange rates on the period end date and assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using the change rate on the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are not material to the Company's accompanying financial statements.

ITEM    2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., financial statements and the related notes thereto. The Management's Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "target," "estimate," "expect," and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions ("will," "may," "could," "should," etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Report on Form 10-Q. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this report. See also the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended July 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2023. Results of Operations Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 Compared to the Three Months Ended January 31, 2022 Net revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 were $744,051 and $591,947 respectively, an increase of 25.71%. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Company's Over-the-Top ("OTT") business segment which includes its SMS messaging and hosting business units. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred total operating expenses of $955,352 compared with $711,014, an increase of 30.32%, for the comparable period ended January 31, 2022. The increase is expenses is due to the expenses associated with the Company's diversification into the financial services markets and increased expenses associated with the expansion of the telecommunications business segment. The Company recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $14,884 and $17,939 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 respectively. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 interest expense was $6,704 and $21,817 respectively. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 the Company recorded a net loss of $218,005, compared to a loss of $134,960 in the same three month period ended January 31, 2022. The increase in loss is due to the Company's diversification into the financial technologies sector and the development of the Company's HammerPay technology. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company is at risk of remaining a going concern. Its ability to remain a going concern is dependent upon whether the company can raise debt and/or equity capital from third-party sources for both working capital and business development needs until such time as the Company may be substantially sustained as a going concern through cash flow from operations or the Company increases its cash flow from operations through sale of services in the ongoing business units, Endstream Communications, 1stPoint Communications and HammerPay. Cash Flow from Operating Activities During the six months ended January 31 2023 the Company's total cash decreased by $375,221, compared to a decrease in cash of $11,478 in the period ended January 31, 2022. Cash flow from Operating Activities decreased by $385,019, compared to a decrease of $23,747 in the period ended January 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to improvements in operations. 17 Cash Flow from Investing Activities During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company's investing activities used $50,152, compared to $23,745 provided by investing activities during the six months ended January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the operations of the company's telecommunications business unit, and particularly the Company's investments in its HammerPay platform. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company used $92,242 in cash from financing activities compared with $36,014 used during the six months ended January 31, 2022. Going Concern As of January 31, 2023, doubt existed as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as the Company has no certainty of earning additional revenues in the future, has a working capital deficit and an overall accumulated deficit since inception. The Company will require additional financing to continue operations either from management, existing shareholders, or new shareholders through equity financing and/or sources of debt financing. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Future Financings We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances of additional shares may result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations and other development activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented new accounting pronouncements that are relevant to the company and are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 18 ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibilities, estimates, and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Our management has concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. This is due to an inherent staffing limitation and the Principal Financial Officer and the President are the same individual. That individual does not maintain day-to-day banking responsibilities to provide some limitation in such risks. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. The President and Principal Financial Officer are the same individual. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Effective November 1, 2018 the management and accounting resources of the 1stPoint subsidiary assumed responsibility of our internal controls. The Company views this migration to have a positive material impact on our ability to maintain internal controls over financial reporting as 1stPoint has a separation in banking, day-to-day accounting and financial reporting responsibilities, however, the President and Principal Financial Officer are the same individual. 19 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, the Company may become subject to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot accurately predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable.
