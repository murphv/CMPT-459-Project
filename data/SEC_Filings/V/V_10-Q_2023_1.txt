Organization.
Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than
200
countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates.
The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 10 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,334   $ 15,689   Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,705   1,449   Customer collateral 2,591   2,342   Prepaid expenses and other current assets

U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See
Note 12—Legal Matters . 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021   (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,449   $ 894   Deposits into the litigation escrow account 350   250   Payments to opt-out merchants (1) , net of interest earned on escrow funds ( 94 ) —   Balance at end of period $ 1,705   $ 1,144   (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See
Note 12—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20  million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.
The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity:
Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 460   $ 812   $ ( 35 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) —   —   ( 8 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment (2) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) 15   Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 453   $ 805   $ ( 28 ) Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2021 $ 1,071   $ 1,523   $ ( 133 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) —   —   ( 7 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 26 ) ( 3 ) 29   Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 1,045   $ 1,520   $ ( 111 ) (1) VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See
Note 12—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) Series B preferred stock $ 1,524   $ 453   $ 1,309   $ 460   Series C preferred stock 2,383   805   2,044   812   Total 3,907   1,258   3,353   1,272   Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 28 ) ( 28 ) ( 35 ) ( 35 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 3,879   $ 1,230   $ 3,318   $ 1,237   (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt.
Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.5  billion and $ 18.4  billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 22.5
billion and $ 19.9
billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value.
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-financial assets.
Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, there were no impairment indicators. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 6—Debt

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement.
Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 123.5  billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 76.0  billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met.
The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022   (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,591   $ 2,342   Pledged securities at market value 255   213   Letters of credit 1,659   1,582   Guarantees 984   950   Total $ 5,489   $ 5,087   18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

16 % and
19 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $ 142  million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 108  million and $ 149  million, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to the reassessment mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 12—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021   (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,456   $ 983   Provision for uncovered legal matters —   1   Provision for covered legal matters 347   146   Payments for legal matters ( 101 ) ( 103 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,702   $ 1,027   Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under  U.S. Covered Litigation
and
Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021   (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,441   $ 881   Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 341   145   Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 101 ) —   Balance at end of period $ 1,681   $ 1,026   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 341  million and deposited $ 350  million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

Plaintiffs primarily allege a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and damages as direct and indirect purchasers based on alleged violations of California law. On January 11, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as asserted in the prior complaint. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

Non-GAAP financial results
below. Russia & Ukraine.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, was approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. The continuing effects of the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 .
We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues increased 12% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 25% over the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses related to personnel and litigation provision. See
Results of Operations—Operating Expenses
below for further discussion. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately one-and-a-half percentage points. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% over the prior year comparable period primarily due to higher personnel and general and administrative expenses.
26 Table of Contents Interchange multidistrict litigation.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual of $341 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See

Previously, in December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 16 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $14.1 billion. See
Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results.
We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments.
Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment.
These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the
companies that we invest in
and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs.
Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded an additional accrual to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $341 million and $145 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $76 million and $32 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions.
Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.
Payments
volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported.
Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
(3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa.

29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 % Change (1)   (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,567   $ 3,178  12  % International 4,369   3,881  13  % Net revenues $ 7,936   $ 7,059  12  % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points. The following table presents the components of our net revenues:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 % Change (1)   (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,511   $ 3,193  10  % Data processing revenues 3,827   3,614  6  % International transaction revenues 2,797   2,174  29  % Other revenues 587   449  31  % Client incentives (2,786) (2,371) 18  % Net revenues
$ 7,936   $ 7,059  12  % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues
increased primarily due to 5% growth in nominal payments volume, despite the impact of our suspension of operations in Russia. Service revenues also increased due to business mix, select pricing modifications and card benefits. • Data processing revenues
increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10%, partially offset by our suspension of operations in Russia. • International transaction revenues
increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 22%, excluding transactions within Europe. International transaction revenues also increased due to volatility of a broad range of currencies and select pricing modifications. • Other revenues
increased primarily due to
value added services revenues tied to marketing and consulting services, acquisition-related revenues and select pricing modifications.
• Client incentives
increased primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses:   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1)   (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,337   $ 1,125  19  % Marketing 332   280  18  % Network and processing 178   190  (6  %) Professional fees 109   100  9  % Depreciation and amortization 227   198  15  % General and administrative 322   242  33  % Litigation provision 341   148  130  % Total operating expenses $ 2,846   $ 2,283  25  % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses
increased primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. • Marketing expenses
increased primarily due to increased spending in various campaigns, including the FIFA World Cup 2022 TM
and client marketing. • Network and processing expenses
decreased primarily due to the absence of fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions as a result of our suspension of operations in Russia, partially offset by continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions and on-going investments. • General and administrative expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in travel expenses, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, and higher usage of travel related card benefits. • Litigation provision
increased primarily due to an increase in accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See
Note 12—Legal Matters
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense)
The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense):
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1)   (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (137) $ (134) 2  % Investment income (expense) and other
24   255  (91  %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ (113) $ 121  (194  %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense
increased primarily due to lower income from derivative instruments and higher interest expense related to the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022. • Investment income (expense) and other
decreased primarily due to losses on our equity investments, partially offset by higher interest income on our cash and investments. 31 Table of Contents Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates:
Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Effective income tax rate 16   % 19  % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $142 million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021   (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,171   $ 4,232  Investing activities (510) (547) Financing activities (6,347) (4,967) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 692   (194) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents
$ (1,994) $ (1,476) Operating activities.
Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher incentive payments, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities.
Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions combined with cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year, partially offset by higher purchases, net of sales and maturities, of investment securities. Financing activities.
Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022
was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See
Note 6—Debt and
Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. 32 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2022, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased
shares
of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $14.1 billion. See
Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we declared and paid $945 million in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 24, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See
Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes. See  Note 6—Debt  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we deposited $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of December 31, 2022 was $1.7 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendments is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3.
