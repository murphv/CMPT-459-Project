NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except per share data)
1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of Article 8 of Regulation S-X and the instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. Janel Corporation (the “Company” or “Janel”) believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the
information presented not misleading. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results
of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year, or any other period. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Business Description
Janel is a holding company with subsidiaries in three business segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing.
The Company strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: supporting its businesses’ efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits; allocating Janel’s capital at high risk-adjusted rates of
return; and attracting and retaining exceptional talent.
Management at the holding company focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and
supporting Janel’s subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries’ organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into
new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.
Revenue and revenue recognition
Logistics
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to
customers. With respect to its Logistics segment, the Company has determined that, in general, each shipment transaction or service order constitutes a separate contract with the customer. When the Company provides multiple services to a
customer, different contracts may be present for different services.
The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations as services are
rendered at a point in time. A typical shipment would include services rendered at origin, such as pick-up and delivery to port, freight services from origin to destination port and destination services, such as customs clearance and final
delivery. The Company measures the performance of its obligations as services are completed at a point in time during the life of a shipment, including services at origin, freight and destination. The Company fulfills nearly all of its
performance obligations within a one- to two-month period.
The Company evaluates whether amounts billed to customers should be reported
as gross or net revenue. Generally, revenue is recorded on a gross basis when the Company is acting as principal and is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services, when it has discretion in setting the prices for
the services to the customers, and the Company has the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party. Revenue is recognized on a net basis when the Company is acting as agent and we do not have latitude in carrier
selection or in establishing rates with the carrier.
In the Logistics segment, the Company disaggregates its revenue by its
five
primary service categories:
trucking, ocean, air,
customs brokerage, and other .
A summary of the Company’s revenue disaggregated by major service lines
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
On

(A)
Stock Options
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair
value of our share-based awards. In applying this model, we use the following assumptions:
•
Risk-free interest rate - We determine the risk-free interest rate by using a weighted
average assumption equivalent to the expected term based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate.
•
Expected term - We estimate the expected term of our options on the average of the
vesting date and term of the option.
•
Expected volatility - We estimate expected volatility using daily
historical trading data of a peer group.
•
Dividend yield - We have never paid dividends on our common stock and currently have no
plans to do so; therefore, no dividend yield is applied.
The fair values of our employee option awards were estimated using the assumptions below, which
yielded the following weighted average grant date fair values for the periods presented:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the above table was calculated as the
difference between the valuation price of Indco’s common stock at December 31, 2022 of $ 15.20
per share and the exercise price of
the stock options that had strike prices below such closing price.
The liability classified awards were measured at fair value at each
reporting date until the final measurement date, which was the date of completion of services required to earn the option. The accrued compensation cost related to these options was approximately $ 320
and $ 361
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30,
2022, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The compensation cost related to these options was approximately $ 31
and $ 50
for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The cost associated with the options issued on each grant date is being recognized ratably over the period of service required to earn each tranche of options.

Table of Contents
Upon vesting, the options continue to be accounted for as a liability in
accordance with ASC 480-10-25-8 and are measured in accordance with ASC 480-10-35 at every reporting period until the options are settled.
On December 13,
2021,
two
minority owners of Indco exercised
7,000
and
3,372
options to purchase Indco’s common stock at an
exercise price of $ 6.48
and $ 12.07
for an aggregate purchase price of $ 45
and $ 41 , respectively. Indco issued related party promissory notes in the amount of $ 45
and $ 41 , respectively, which bear interest at
1 % per annum; both interest and principal are payable on the maturity date of
December 31, 2024 . These notes are included in security deposits and other long-term assets. The fair value of the
7,000
and
3,372
shares of Indco’s common stock was recorded as an increase in mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. On
December 13, 2021, Indco repurchased
7,000
shares of Indco’s stock at a purchase price of $ 17.16
per share from a minority owner of Indco for the aggregate purchase price of $ 120 . The fair value of the repurchased
7,000
shares of
Indco’s common stock was recorded as a decrease in mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. As a result of the exercise of
10,372
options and the repurchase of
7,000
shares of Indco’s stock, the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest percentage was
9.77 % as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in the fair value of the vested options are recognized in earnings in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
The options are classified as liabilities, and the underlying shares of
Indco’s common stock also contain put options which result in their classification as a mandatorily redeemable security. While their redemption does not occur on a fixed date, there is an unconditional obligation for the Company to repurchase
the shares upon death.
As of December 31, 2022,
there was
approximately $ 76
of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested Indco stock options. This expense is expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than
one year .

OVERVIEW
Janel Corporation (“Janel,” the “Company” or the “Registrant”) is a holding company with subsidiaries in three business segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing. The Company strives to
create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: supporting its businesses’ efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits; allocating Janel’s capital at high risk-adjusted rates of return; and attracting and
retaining exceptional talent.
Management at the Janel holding company focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting Janel’s subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through
its subsidiaries’ organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably priced companies
with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.
Logistics
The Company’s Logistics segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Logistics segment is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management
services, including freight forwarding via air, ocean and land-based carriers; customs brokerage services; warehousing and distribution services; trucking and other value-added logistics services. In addition to these revenue streams, the Company
earns accessorial revenue in connection with its core services. Accessorial revenue includes, but is not limited to, fuel service charges, wait time fees, hazardous cargo fees, labor charges, handling, cartage, bonding and additional labor charges.
Life Sciences
The Company’s Life Sciences segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies, diagnostic reagents and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and provides antibody manufacturing for academic and industry research scientists. Our Life Sciences segment also produces products for other life science companies on
an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis.
On November 1, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the outstanding stock of ImmunoBioScience Corporation, which we include in our Life Sciences segment.
On August 15, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all the membership interests of ECM Biosciences LLC, which we include in our Life Sciences segment.
Manufacturing
The Company’s Manufacturing segment is comprised of Indco, Inc. (“Indco”). Indco is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company that manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatus for
specific applications within various industries. Indco’s customer base is comprised of small- to mid-sized businesses as well as other larger customers for which Indco fulfills repetitive production orders.
Investment in Marketable Securities - Rubicon
On August 19, 2022, the Company acquired 1,108,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Rubicon Technology, Inc. ("Rubicon"), at a price per share of $20.00, in a cash tender
offer made pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 2022, between the Company and Rubicon (the "Rubicon Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Rubicon Purchase Agreement, the acquired shares represented 44.99% of
Rubicon's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of August 3, 2022, as reported in Rubicon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022.
Rubicon is a vertically integrated, advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. Rubicon uses proprietary crystal growth
technology to produce high-quality sapphire products to meet customers exacting specifications.
The purpose of our investment in Rubicon is for Janel to acquire a significant ownership interest in Rubicon, together with representation on Rubicon's Board, in an attempt to (i) restructure the
Rubicon business to achieve profitability and (ii) assist Rubicon in utilizing its net operating loss carry-forward assets. Although we are optimistic about our investment in Rubicon, our investment involves risks and uncertainties that are beyond
our control.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a description of the Company’s critical accounting policies
and estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 9, 2022. Critical
accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting
policies during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
While we prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also utilize and present certain financial measures, in particular adjusted operating income, which is not based on or
included in U.S. GAAP (we refer to these as “non-GAAP financial measures”).
Organic Growth
Our non-GAAP financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months.
The organic growth presentation provides useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period.
Adjusted Operating Income
As a result of our acquisition strategy, our net income includes material non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer-related intangible assets in the ordinary course of business as well
as other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Although these charges may increase as we complete more acquisitions, we believe we will be growing the value of our intangible assets such as customer relationships. Because these charges
are not indicative of our operations, we believe that adjusted operating income is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric for our business that is more
representative of the actual results of our operations.
Adjusted operating income (which excludes the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and cost recognized on the sale of acquired inventory valuation) is used by
management as a supplemental performance measure to assess our business’s ability to generate cash and economic returns.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of income and does not include the effects of preferred stock dividends, interest and taxes.
We believe that organic growth and adjusted operating income provide useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management. However, organic growth
and adjusted operating income are not financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for total revenue, operating income or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Using these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our business has material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of management regarding the nature and classification of events and
circumstances that users of the financial statements may find significant.
In addition, although other companies may report measures titled organic growth, adjusted operating income or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how
we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider organic growth and adjusted operating income alongside other financial performance
measures, including total revenue, operating income and our other financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $57,044, which was $26,270 or 32% lower than the prior year period. Revenue over this period decreased primarily due to lower
freight prices in our Logistics segment as a result of lower freight demand relative to improved global transportation capacity.
Income from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1,380 compared with $2,642 in the prior year period. The decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 resulted from
lower profits across of our business segments, especially at our Logistics segment which benefited from unusual demand in the prior year.
Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $360 or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1,688 or $1.66 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31,
2021. The decline in net income was largely due to lower profits in our business segments, higher interest expense and a non-cash mark-to-market write-down of an equity investment.
Adjusted operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to $2,057 versus $3,362 in the prior year period. The decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 resulted
from an overall decrease in profits.

due to lower freight prices as a result of lower freight demand relative to improved global transportation capacity.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $11,533, a decrease of $413, or 3%, as compared to $11,946 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin as a percentage of
revenue increased to 22.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 15.4% for the prior year period. Our gross profit margin increased as gross profit declined slightly as compared with gross revenue which declined more
significantly due to lower freight prices.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $9,528, as compared to $9,349 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase of $179, or 2%,
was mainly due to additional personnel investments. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 18.4% and 12.1% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue largely reflected the reduction in transportation rates and additional personnel investments.

$592. Income from operations decreased as a result of lower transportation demand and higher personnel investments. Operating margin as a percentage of gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 17.4% compared to 21.7% in the
prior year period due to lower gross profits and higher personnel investments.

Revenue

reflected a decrease in volume across the business offset in part by higher product pricing.

December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 53.0% and 51.7%, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was generally due to a more favorable mix of business .
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $774 and $729 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $45 or 6.2%. The increase in expenses relative to
revenue for the three-month periods reflected the mix of business.

Income from operations was $500 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $571 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a 12.4% decrease from the prior year period due
to the timing of orders.

Total Corporate Expenses
Total Corporate expenses, which include amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and merger and acquisition expenses, increased by $206 or 13.6%, to $1,725 in the three months ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to $1,519 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation, higher accounting-related professional expense, an increase in merger and acquisition expenses
and increases in amortization of intangible expenses. We incur merger and acquisition deal-related expenses and intangible amortization at the Corporate level rather than at the segment level.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the consolidated company increased $195, or 69.9%, to $474   for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 from $279 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average debt balances to support our acquisition efforts.
Income Tax Expense
On a consolidated basis, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $147   for the three months ended December
31, 2022, as compared to an income tax expense of $675 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in expense was primarily due to lower pretax income.
Preferred Stock Dividends
Preferred stock dividends include any dividends accrued but not paid on the Company’s Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). For the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, preferred stock dividends were $72 and $211, respectively, representing a decrease of $139, or 65.9%. The decrease in preferred stock dividends was the result of the Company retiring $6,000 of Series C Preferred Stock on March 31, 2022
and the change in the annual dividend rate from 9% to 5%.
Net Income
Net income was $360, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $1,688 or $1.66 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31,
2021.The decline in net income was largely due to lower profits in our business segments, higher interest expenses and a non-cash mark-to-market write-down of an equity investment.
Income Available to Common Stockholders
Income available to holders of Common Stock was $288, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to income available to holders of Common Stock of $1,477, or
$1.45 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in net income available to common stockholders reflected lower net income, partially offset by a decrease in the dividend rate with respect to the Series C Stock as of March 31, 2022 from
9% to 5%.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
General
Our ability to satisfy liquidity requirements, include meeting debt obligations and funding working capital, day-to-day operating expenses and capital expenditures, depends upon future performance,
which is subject to general economic conditions, competition and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our Logistics segment depends on commercial credit facilities to fund day-to-day operations as there is a difference between the
timing of collection cycles and the timing of payments to vendors.
As a customs broker, our Logistics segment makes significant cash advances for a select group of our credit-worthy customers. These cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of
duties and taxes to customs authorities primarily in the United States. Increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers. Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component
of revenue and expense. The billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities. These “pass
through” billings can influence our traditional credit collection metrics.
For customers that meet certain criteria, we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms. Management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and has
historically experienced relatively insignificant collection problems. Our subsidiaries depend on commercial credit facilities to fund day-to-day operations as there is a difference between the timing of collection cycles and the timing of payments
to vendors. Generally, we do not make significant capital expenditures.
Our cash flow performance for the 2022 fiscal year may not necessarily be indicative of future cash flow performance.
Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,780 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, versus $5,291 provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The
increase in cash provided by operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period was driven principally by lower net income offset by lower net working capital at our Logistics segment.
Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,927 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, versus $169 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. We used $80 for the acquisition of property
and equipment and $2,847 for the acquisition of one business for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $169 for the acquisition of property and equipment for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $5,289 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, versus net cash used in financing activities of $6,170 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net
cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily included repayment of funds from our line of credit, and repayment of funds from our term loan. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months
ended December 31, 2021 primarily included repayments of funds from our line of credit and repayments of term loans.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
