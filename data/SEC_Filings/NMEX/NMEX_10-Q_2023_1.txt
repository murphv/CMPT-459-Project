ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   Northern Minerals & Exploration Ltd. (the “Company”) is an emerging natural resource company operating in oil and gas production in central Texas and exploration for gold and silver in northern Nevada.   The Company was incorporated in Nevada on December 11, 2006 under the name Punchline Entertainment, Inc. On August 22, 2012, the Company’s board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to effect a name change of the Company from Punchline Entertainment, Inc. to Punchline Resources Ltd. On July 12, 2013, the stockholders approved an amendment to change the name of the Company from Punchline Resources Ltd. to Northern Mineral & Exploration Ltd. FINRA approved the name change on August 13, 2013.   On November 22, 2017, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Kathis Energy LLC (“Kathis”) for the purpose of conducting oil and gas drilling programs in Texas.   On December 14, 2017, Kathis Energy, LLC and other Limited Partners, created Kathis Energy Fund 1, LP, a limited partnership created for raising investor funds.   On May 7, 2018, the Company created ENMEX LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary in Mexico, for the purposes of managing and operating its investments in Mexico including but not limited to the Joint Venture opportunity being negotiated with Pemer Bacalar on the 61 acres on the Bacalar Lagoon on the Yucatan Peninsula. There was no activity from inception to date.   NOTE 2

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of presentation The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending July 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022.   Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.   Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturities for the instruments held. The Company had no cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.   Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kathis Energy LLC, Kathis Energy Fund 1, LLP and Enmex Operations LLC. All financial information has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.     F-6 Table of Contents   Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred until such time as economic reserves are quantified. Cost of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. We have chosen to expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred given that it is still in the exploration stage. Once our company has identified proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized over the estimated life of the probable-proven reserves. When our company has capitalized mineral properties, these properties will be periodically assessed for impairment of value and any diminution in value.   Oil and Gas Properties The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether those wells are successful or unsuccessful. Other exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties are computed on a well-by-well basis using the units-of-production method. Although the Company has recognized minimal levels of production and revenue in the past, none of its property have proved reserves. Therefore, the Company’s properties are designated as unproved properties.
Unproved property costs are not subject to amortization and consist primarily of leasehold costs related to unproved areas. Unproved property costs are transferred to proved properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive and are assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of partial interest in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all cost is recovered. Unproved properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop acreage.
Asset Retirement Obligation Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (“ASC 410”) requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the equivalent unit-of-production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. To date, the Company has very few operating wells. Currently, the Company has one working well. Because there is only one active well on the Ritchie Lease with a
24 % working interest, the Company estimates the asset retirement obligation to be trivial and has not recorded an ARO liability.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to ASC 260-10-45,
Earnings per Share—Overall—Other Presentation Matters . Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period.
For the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had no potentially dilutive shares of common stock. For the six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company had
1,911,330
of potentially dilutive shares from warrants. The diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an antidilutive effect due to our loss from operations.   Recently issued accounting pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.     F-7 Table of Contents   NOTE 3

GOING CONCERN   The accompanying unaudited financial statements are prepared and presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, they do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Since inception to January 31, 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 3,469,968 . The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   NOTE 4

WINNEMUCCA MOUNTAIN PROPERTY
On September 14, 2012, we entered into an option agreement with AHL Holdings Ltd., and Golden Sands Exploration Inc. (“Optionors”), wherein we acquired an option to purchase an
80 % interest in and to certain mining claims, which claims form the Winnemucca Mountain Property in Humboldt County, Nevada (“Property”). This property currently is comprised of 138 unpatented mining claims covering approximately
2,700
acres.
On July 23, 2018, the Company entered into a New Option Agreement with the Optionors. This agreement provided for the payment of $ 25,000
and the issuance of
3,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and work commitments. The Company issued the shares and made the initial payment of $ 25,000
per the terms of the July 31, 2018 agreement. The second payment of $ 25,000
per the terms of the agreement was not paid when it became due on August 31, 2018, causing the Company to default on the terms of the July 23, 2018 agreement.
On March 25, 2019 the Company entered into a New Option Agreement with the Optionors. As stated in the New Option Agreement the Company has agreed to certain terms and conditions to have the right to earn an
80 % interest in the Property, these terms include cash payments, issuance of common shares of the Company and work commitments.
The Company’s firm commitments per the March 25, 2019, option agreement total $ 381,770
of which cash payments total $ 181,770
and a firm work commitment of $ 200,000 . These commitments include payments for rentals payable to BLM and also for the staking of new claims adjoining the existing claims. The work commitment was to be conducted prior to December 31, 2020. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company received notice from the Optionors of the current amount due resulting in the reduction of the liability to $ 285,453 . As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company has accounted for $ 285,453
and $ 285,453 , respectively, in its accrued liabilities.   The Company has received notice from the Optionors, effective October 27, 2020, that its Option Agreement to earn an interest in the Winnemucca Mountain Gold Property has been terminated for being in default of certain terms and conditions of the Agreement. Management is in discussions with the principals of the Winnemucca property to resolve any outstanding obligations.   The Company does not fully agree with the amount due and is working to resolve the issue.   NOTE 5
