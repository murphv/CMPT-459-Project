GROUP CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
ATXG
and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) are engaged in the business of garments manufacturing, providing logistic services and
property leasing and management service in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”).
2.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
In
the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances are eliminated in consolidation. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessary
be indicative of annual results.
The
Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) on June 23, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”).

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates
using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
There
is no change on the accounting policies for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments. This standard requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be
presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial
asset. This standard will be effective for the Company on April 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

advanced to suppliers are fully refundable on demand.
The
Company reviews a supplier’s credit history and background information before advancing a payment. If the financial condition of
its suppliers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to deliver goods or provide services, the Company would
recognize bad debt expense in the period they are considered unlikely to be collected.

to global economic prospects and this has impacted the Company’s operations and its financial performance in the last three quarters
of the financial year and subsequent to the financial year end.
As
the situation continues to evolve with significant level of uncertainty, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the full financial
impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and to mitigate the financial impact, it is conscientiously
managing its cost by adopting an operating cost reduction strategy and conserving liquidity by working with major creditors to align
repayment obligations with receivable collections.

Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our
plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors and Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this report. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,”

Overview
Our
Business
We
are a garment manufacturer and logistics services provider based in China. We are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol
of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into three segments: Garment manufacturing, Logistics services, and Property management
and subleasing. We used to have an operating segment named “Epidemic prevention supplies”, which included manufacturing,
distribution and trading of epidemic prevention supplies. As the COVID-19 pandemic is getting better, the Company ceased to operate in
the Epidemic prevention supplies business at the beginning of the quarter.
Our
garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesaler located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
We have our own manufacturing facilities, with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that
we meet our high-quality control standards and timely delivery requirement for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations
through three wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”), Dongguan Yushang Clothing
Co., Ltd (“YS”), and Shantou Yi Bai Yi Garments Co., Ltd (“YBY”) which are located in the Guangdong province,
China.
Our
logistic business consists of delivery and courier services covering approximately 79 cities in approximately seven provinces and two
municipalities in China. Although we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors.
We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs
of keeping drivers during slow seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through three wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin
Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd (“XKJ”), Shenzhen Yingxi Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“PF”) and Shenzhen Yingxi
Tongda Logistic Co., Ltd (“TD”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
Our
property management and subleasing provides shops subleasing and property management services for garment wholesalers and retailers in
garment market. We conduct our property management and subleasing operation through a wholly owned subsidiary, namely Dongguan Yingxi
Daying Commercial Co., Ltd (“DY”).

Business
Objectives
Garment
Manufacturing Business
We
believe the strength of our garment manufacturing business is mainly due to our consistent emphasis on exceptional quality and timely
delivery of our products. The primary business objective for our garment manufacturing segment is to expand our customer base and improve
our profit.
Logistics
Services Business
The
business objective and future plan for our logistics services segment is to establish an efficient logistic system and to build a nationwide
delivery and courier network in China. As of December 31, 2022, we provide logistics services to over 79 cities in approximately seven
provinces and two municipalities. We expect to develop an additional 20 logistics points in existing serving cities and improve the Company’s
profit in the year end of 2023.
Property
Management and Subleasing Business
The
business objective of our property management and subleasing segment is to integrate resources in shopping mall, develop e-commerce bases
and the Internet celebrity economy together to drive to increase the value of the stores in the area. The short-term goal for the year
is to increase the occupancy rate of stores in the mall to more than 70%.
Seasonality
of Business
Our
business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of garment sales in our second and third quarters and higher logistics services
revenue in our third and fourth quarters. These trends primarily result from the timing of seasonal garment manufacturing shipments and
holiday periods in the logistics services segment.
Collection
Policy
Garment
manufacturing business
For
our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by advances or deposits. For our long-term and established customers
with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following their acknowledgement of receipt
of goods.
Logistics
services business
For
logistics services, we generally receive payments from the customers between 30 to 90 days following the date of the registration of
our receipt of packages.
Property
management and subleasing business
For
property management and subleasing business, we generally collect rental and management fees of the following month each month in advance.
4
Economic
Uncertainty
Our
business is dependent on consumer demand for our products and services. We believe that the significant uncertainty in the economy in
China has increased our clients’ sensitivity to the cost of our products and services. We have experienced continued pricing pressure.
If the economic environment becomes weak, the economic conditions could have a negative impact on our sales growth and operating margins,
cash position and collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, business credit and liquidity have tightened in China. Some of our
suppliers and customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems and other financial hardships. These factors currently
have not had an impact on the timeliness of receivable collections from our customers. We cannot predict at this time how this situation
will develop and whether accounts receivable may need to be allowed for or written off in the coming quarters.
Despite
the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current economy in China, we believe our core strengths will continue to allow
us to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.
Summary
of Critical Accounting Policies
We
have identified critical accounting policies that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying
accounting standards and operation involved could result in material changes to our financial position or results of operations under
different conditions or using different assumptions.
Estimates
and Assumptions
We
regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates
are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is generated through sale of goods and delivery services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods
or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification
of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination
of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
contract;
(iii)
measurement
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
5
The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606
at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated
to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s
performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.
For
all reporting periods, the Company has not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product and service revenue
contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules.
Leases
Lessee
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in
property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, The Company generally use the incremental
borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement
date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lessor
As
a lessor, the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. Leases, in which the Company is the lessor, are
substantially all accounted for as operating leases and the lease components and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments. This standard requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be
presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial
asset. This standard will be effective for the Company on April 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
Total
revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $0.7 million, or 24.0%, as compared with the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to an increase of approximately $0.1 million in garment manufacturing, a decrease
of approximately $0.5 million in logistics services business, and a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in property management and
subleasing business.
The
revenue generated from our garment manufacturing business was $0.1 million, or approximately 4.7%, of total revenue for the three months
ended December 31, 2022. The revenue generated from the segment was $0.03 million, or approximately 0.9%, of total revenue for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The low revenue was mainly due to factory facilities renewals and repairs, and the remaining factories
cannot provide as much capacity as previously. We estimate the manufacturing capacity will recover at end of the fiscal year 2023.

suppliers.
Raw
material costs for our garment manufacturing business were $28,313, approximately 19.9% of our total garment manufacturing business revenue
in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $1,719,420, approximately 69.1% in the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease was mainly due to the decrease of the average purchase cost of the raw materials.
Labor
costs for our garment manufacturing business were $73,376, approximately 51.7% of our total garment manufacturing business revenue in
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $542,118, approximately 21.8% in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was mainly due to the rising wages in the PRC.

and other expenses for our garment manufacturing business accounted for $4,380, approximately 3.1% of our total garment business revenue
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $23,124, 0.9% of total garment business revenue for the nine months ended
December 31, 2021.
For
our logistic business, we outsourced some of the business to our contractors. The Company relied on a few subcontractors, in which the
subcontracting fees to our largest subcontractor represented approximately 25.8% and 30.3% of total cost of revenues for our service
segment for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The percentage decreased was due to the usage of our own
logistics more than usage of the subcontractors under COVID-19 epidemic. We have not experienced any disputes with our subcontractors
and we believe we maintain good relationships with our contract logistics services providers.
Fuel,
toll and other costs for our service business for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.9 million compared with
$1.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Fuel, toll and other costs for our service business accounted for approximately
50.1% of our total service revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with 34.0% for the nine months ended December
31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the decrease of use of subcontractors under the COVID-19 epidemic circumstance.
Subcontracting
fees for our service business for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 52.3% to approximately $0.9 million
from $1.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Subcontracting fees accounted for approximately 23.3% and 45.1% of our
total service business revenue in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease was primarily because
the Company used less subcontractors under the epidemic circumstance.
