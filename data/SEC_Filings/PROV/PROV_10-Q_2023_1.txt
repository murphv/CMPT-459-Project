It is recommended that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 (“2022 Annual Form 10-K”). The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. ​ ​ Note 2: Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) There have been no accounting standard updates or changes in the status of their adoption that are material to the Corporation as previously disclosed in Note 1 of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Form 10-K, except the following: ASU 2020-04: In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or other rate references expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU permits an entity to make necessary modifications to eligible contracts or transactions without requiring contract re-measurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. In January 2021, ASU 2021-01 clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the changes in the interest rates used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment for derivative instruments that are being implemented as part of the market-wide transition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the “discounting transition”). In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The FASB had originally included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the LIBOR would cease being published. In March 2021, it was announced that the intended cessation date of LIBOR would be extended to June 30, 2023. As a result, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 deferring the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Corporation is in the process of compiling data on the impact of reference rate reform and has not determined the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. ​ ASU 2016-13: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in November 2018, ASU No. 2018-19, April 2019, ASU 2019-04, May 2019, ASU 2019-05, November 2019, ASU 2019-11, February 2020, ASU 2020-02, March 2020, ASU 2020-03 and March 2022, ASU 2022-02, all of which clarifies codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance. In November 2019, the FASB also issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates” extending the adoption date for certain registrants, including the Corporation. These ASUs related to Topic 326 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Corporation is evaluating its current expected loss methodology of its loans held for investment and investment securities held to maturity
7
Table of Contents to identify the necessary modifications in accordance with these standards and expects a change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance for credit losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. The Corporation has established a project team and implementation plan to address the key components to this process. The Corporation has determined its loan segmentation and compiled historical data, which is currently under evaluation. The Corporation is preparing to evaluate the appropriate methodologies for each loan grouping and is beginning testing, parallel runs, and sensitivity analysis on its initial modeling assumptions and results prior to the adoption date of July 1, 2023. The Corporation anticipates the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment to change through a one-time adjustment to retained earnings and is still evaluating the potential impact upon adoption that these ASUs will have on the Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements; however, until the evaluation is complete the magnitude of the potential change will be unknown. ​ ​ Note 3: Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Corporation. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were outstanding options to purchase
434,500
shares and
431,000
shares of the Corporation’s common stock, respectively. Of those shares, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were
434,000
shares and
130,000
shares, respectively, that were excluded from the diluted EPS computation as their effect was anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were outstanding restricted stock awards of
147,750
shares and
99,250
shares, respectively.

1,037,213 ​ The Corporation has developed an internal loan grading system to evaluate and quantify the Bank’s loans held for investment portfolio with respect to quality and risk. Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Corporation’s loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses using quantitative and qualitative methods. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are individually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. Quantitative loan loss factors are developed by determining the historical loss experience, expected future cash flows, discount rates and collateral fair values, among others. Qualitative loan loss factors are developed by assessing general economic indicators such as gross domestic product, retail sales, unemployment rates, employment growth, California home sales and median California home prices. The Corporation assigns individual factors for the quantitative and qualitative methods for each loan category and each internal risk rating. The Corporation categorizes all of the loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: ● Pass - These loans range from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The likelihood of loss is considered remote. ● Special Mention - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected, may result in a loss. While concerns exist, the bank is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and not imminent. ● Substandard - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. ● Doubtful - A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. ● Loss - A loss loan is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. ​ 12

937,970 ​ The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loans held for investment and upon management’s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loans held for investment. These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loans held for investment, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and determination of the realizable value of the collateral securing the loans. The provision (recovery) for (from) the allowance for loan losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Corporation’s loans held for investment, will not request a significant increase in its allowance for loan losses. Future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporation’s control. Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes
150  days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and
120  days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were modified from their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified in the Corporation’s asset quality reports as troubled debt restructurings (“restructured loans”), the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes
90  days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes
60  days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying ASC 310, “Receivables.”  For restructured loans that are less than
90  days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and  containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than
60  days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for restructured loans) or collateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required. 13

Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The following tables identify the Corporation’s total recorded investment in non-performing loans by type at the dates and for the periods indicated. Generally, a loan is placed on non-accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest or if the loan is deemed impaired, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower’s financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current, the borrower(s) has demonstrated sustained payment performance and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected on a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance reserve have been individually evaluated for impairment using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less costs to sell, to establish realizable value. This analysis may identify a specific impairment amount needed or may conclude that no reserve is needed. Loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment are included in pools of homogeneous loans for evaluation of related allowance reserves. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ At December 31, 2022 ​ ​ Unpaid ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net ​ ​ Principal ​ Related ​ Recorded ​ ​ ​ Recorded (In Thousands)      Balance      Charge-offs      Investment      Allowance (1)      Investment ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Mortgage loans: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Single-family:   ​      ​      ​      ​      ​    With a related allowance ​ $

million, respectively. The Corporation records payments on non-performing loans utilizing the cash basis or cost recovery method of accounting during the periods when the loans are on non-performing status. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Bank received $ 16,000
in interest payments from non-performing loans, of which $ 15,000
was recognized as interest income and the remaining $ 1,000
was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method. In comparison, for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Bank received $ 138,000
in interest payments from non-performing loans, of which $ 131,000
was recognized as interest income and the remaining $ 7,000

no
restructured loans were in default within a 12-month period subsequent to their original restructuring. As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation held
two
restructured loans with a net outstanding balance of $ 972,000 , of which
one
loan totaling $ 714,000
was classified as substandard and on non-accrual status. As of June 30, 2022, the Corporation held
13
restructured loans with a net outstanding balance of $ 4.5
million, of which
one
loan totaling $ 722,000
was classified as substandard on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, all of the restructured loans were current with respect to their modified payment terms at both dates. The Corporation upgrades restructured single-family loans to the pass category if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments for at least six consecutive months; 12 months for those loans that were restructured more than once; and if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan. In addition to the payment history described above, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans must also demonstrate a combination of the following characteristics to be upgraded: satisfactory cash flow, satisfactory guarantor support, and additional collateral support, among others. To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Corporation. The Corporation re-underwrites the loan with the borrower’s updated financial information, new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies.

During the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no
properties were acquired in the settlement of loans and
no
previously foreclosed upon properties were sold. As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there was no real estate owned property. A new appraisal is obtained on each of the properties at the time of foreclosure and fair value is derived by using the lower of the appraised value or the listing price of the property, net of selling costs. Any initial loss is recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses before being transferred to real estate owned. Subsequent to transfer to real estate owned, if there is further deterioration in real estate values, specific real estate owned loss reserves are established and charged to the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, the Corporation records costs to carry real estate owned as real estate owned operating expenses as incurred. ​ ​ Note 6: Derivative and Other Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risks The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale commitments to third parties and option contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the
22
Table of Contents contractual amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Corporation had commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment of $ 8.4
million and $ 43.4
million, respectively. The following table provides information at the dates indicated regarding undisbursed funds on construction loans, undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of credit with the Corporation as well as commitments to originate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Commitments ​ December 31, 2022 ​ June 30, 2022 ​ (In Thousands)   ​      ​      Undisbursed loan funds – Construction loans ​ $

99 ​ In accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and interpretations of the Derivatives Implementation Group of the FASB, the fair value of the commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, loan sale commitments, to be announced (“TBA”) MBS trades, put option contracts and call option contracts are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments; therefore, all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were
no
outstanding derivative financial instruments. Loans previously sold to the FHLB – San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program have a recourse liability. The FHLB – San Francisco absorbs the first
four
basis points of loss by establishing a first loss account and a credit scoring process is used to calculate the maximum recourse amount for the Bank. All losses above the Bank’s maximum recourse amount are the responsibility of the FHLB – San Francisco. The FHLB – San Francisco pays the Bank a credit enhancement fee on a monthly basis to compensate the Bank for accepting the recourse obligation. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Bank serviced $ 3.8
million and $ 4.1
million of loans under this program, respectively, and has established a recourse liability of $ 10,500
at both dates. Occasionally, the Bank is required to repurchase loans sold to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or other investors if it is determined that such loans do not meet the credit requirements of the investor, or if one of the parties involved in the loan misrepresented pertinent facts, committed fraud, or if such loans were 90-days past due within 120 days of the loan funding date. During the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank did
no t repurchase any loans or settle any request to repurchase a loan. In addition to the specific recourse liability for the MPF program, the Bank established a recourse liability of $ 150,000
for loans sold to other investors at both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

160 ​ ​ ​ Note 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Corporation adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” and elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825, “Financial Instruments.” ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 825 permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the “Fair Value Option”) at specified election dates. At each subsequent reporting date, an entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items in earnings for which the fair value option has been elected. The objective of the Fair Value Option is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The following table describes the difference at the dates indicated between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment at fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unpaid ​ Net ​ ​ Aggregate ​ Principal ​ Unrealized (In Thousands)      Fair Value      Balance      Loss As of December 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Loans held for investment, at fair value ​ $

( 173 ) ​ ASC 820-10-65-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,” provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. 24
Table of Contents ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. ​ ASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. The Corporation’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale, loans held for investment at fair value and interest-only strips; while non-performing loans, mortgage servicing assets ("MSA") and real estate owned, if any, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Investment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and privately issued CMO. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the CMO (Level 3). Loans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale. The fair value is determined by the management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan, in addition to the quoted secondary-market prices which account for the interest rate characteristics of each loan (Level 3). Non-performing loans are loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or of the collateral pledged. The non-performing loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The fair value of a non-performing loan is determined based on an observable market price or current appraised value of the underlying collateral. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the borrower. For non-performing loans which are restructured loans, the fair value is derived from discounted cash flow analysis (Level 3), except those which are in the process of foreclosure or 90 days delinquent for which the fair value is derived from the appraised value of its collateral (Level 2). For other non-performing loans which are not restructured loans, other than non-performing commercial real estate loans, the fair value is derived from relative value analysis: historical experience and management estimates by loan type for which collectively evaluated allowances are assigned (Level 3); or the appraised value of its collateral for loans which are in the process of foreclosure or where borrowers file bankruptcy (Level 2). For non-performing commercial real estate loans, the fair value is derived from the appraised value of its collateral (Level 2). Non-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above. This loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), but rather as a component in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. These adjustments to the estimated fair value of non-performing loans may result in increases or decreases to the provision for loan losses recorded in current earnings. The Corporation uses the amortization method for its MSA, which amortizes the MSA in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assesses the MSA for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the MSA is derived using the present value method; which includes a third party’s prepayment projections of similar instruments, weighted-average coupon rates, estimated servicing costs and discount interest rates (Level 3). 25
Table of Contents The rights to future income from serviced loans that exceed contractually specified servicing fees are recorded as interest-only strips. The fair value of interest-only strips is derived using the same assumptions that are used to value the related MSA (Level 3). The Corporation’s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporation’s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The following fair value hierarchy tables present information at the dates indicated about the Corporation’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using: (In Thousands)      Level 1      Level 2      Level 3      Total Assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Investment securities - available for sale: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ U.S. government agency MBS ​ $

84,299 ​ Loans held for investment, not recorded at fair value: For loans that reprice frequently at market rates, the carrying amount approximates the fair value. For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future cash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which such loans would be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices. Investment securities - held to maturity:  The investment securities - held to maturity consist of time deposits at CRA qualified minority financial institutions, U.S. SBA securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS. Due to the short-term nature of the time deposits, the principal balance approximated fair value (Level 2). For the MBS, CMO and SBA securities, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement (Level 2). FHLB – San Francisco stock: The carrying amount reported for FHLB – San Francisco stock approximates fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock. Deposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based upon rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation and management estimates of current market conditions. Borrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on such borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation generally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily utilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes to the Corporation’s valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its condensed  consolidated financial position or results of operations. ​ ​ ​ Note 8: Revenue From Contracts With Customers In accordance with ASC 606, revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to the customer in exchange for the consideration the Corporation expects to be entitled to receive. The largest portion of the Corporation's revenue is from interest income, which is not in the scope of ASC 606. All of the Corporation's revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606 is recognized in non-interest income. 30
Table of Contents If a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Corporation recognizes revenue as it satisfies a performance obligation. Payments from customers are generally collected at the time services are rendered, monthly, quarterly or annually. For contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is either earned at a point in time or revenue is earned over time. Examples of revenue earned at a point in time are automated teller machine ("ATM") transaction fees, wire transfer fees, overdraft fees and interchange fees. Revenue is primarily based on the number and type of transactions that are generally derived from transactional information accumulated by our systems and is recognized immediately as the transactions occur or upon providing the service to complete the customer's transaction. The Corporation is generally the principal in these contracts, with the exception of interchange fees, in which case the Corporation is acting as the agent and records revenue net of expenses paid to the principal. Examples of revenue earned over time, which generally occur on a monthly basis, are deposit account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, merchant revenue, trust and investment management fees and safe deposit box fees. Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by our systems or those of third-parties and is recognized as the related transactions occur or services are rendered to the customer. Disaggregation of Revenue: The following table includes the Corporation's non-interest income disaggregated by type of services for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Quarter Ended ​ Six Months Ended

Revenues recognized within the scope of ASC 606: Deposit account fees :
Fees are earned on the Bank's deposit accounts for various products offered to or services performed for the Bank's customers. Fees include business account fees, non-sufficient fund fees, ATM fees and others. These fees are recognized concurrent with the event on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of service. Card and processing fees :
Debit interchange income represents fees earned when a debit card issued by the Bank is used. The Bank earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions through a third-party payment network. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are earned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholders’ debit card. Certain expenses directly associated with the debit cards are recorded on a net basis with the interchange income. Other :
Includes asset management fees, certain loan related fees, stop payment fees, wire services fees, safe deposit box fees and other fees earned on other services, such as merchant services or occasional non-recurring type services, and are recognized at the time of the event or the applicable billing cycle. Asset management fees are variable, since they are based on the underlying portfolio value, which is subject to market conditions and amounts invested by customers through a third-party provider. Asset management fees are recognized over the period that services are provided, and when the portfolio values are known or can be estimated at the end of each month. Loan related fees include (loss) gain on sale of
31
Table of Contents loans, prepayment fees, late charges, brokered loan fees, maintenance fees and others. These fees are recognized  concurrent with the event on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of service. ​ ​ Note 9: Leases The Corporation accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842 which requires the Corporation to record liabilities for future lease obligations as well as assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets. The Corporation's leases primarily represent future obligations to make payments for the use of buildings, space or equipment for its operations. Liabilities to make future lease payments are recorded in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities, while right-of-use assets are recorded in premises and equipment in the Corporation's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. At December 31, 2022, all of the Corporation's leases were classified as operating leases and the Corporation did not have any operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less ("short-term leases"). Liabilities to make future lease payments and right of use assets are recorded for operating leases and do not include short-term leases. These liabilities and right-of-use assets are determined based on the total contractual base rents for each lease, which include options to extend or renew each lease, where applicable, and where the Corporation believes it has an economic incentive to extend or renew the lease. Due to the fact that lease extensions are not reasonably certain, the Corporation generally does not recognize payments occurring during option periods in the calculation of its operating right-of-use lease assets and operating lease liabilities. The Corporation utilizes the FHLB – San Francisco rates as a discount rate for each of the remaining contractual terms at the adoption date as well as for future leases if the discount rate is not stated in the lease. For leases that contain variable lease payments, the Corporation assumes future lease payment escalations based on a lease payment escalation rate specified in the lease or the specified index rate observed at the time of lease commencement. Liabilities to make future lease payments are accounted for using the interest method, being reduced by periodic contractual lease payments net of periodic interest accretion. Right-of-use assets for operating leases are amortized over the term of the associated lease by amounts that represent the difference between periodic straight-line lease expense and periodic interest accretion in the related liability to make future lease payments. For the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, expenses associated with the Corporation’s leases totaled $ 216,000
and $ 219,000 , respectively, and were recorded in premises and occupancy expenses and equipment expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, expenses associated with the Corporation’s leases totaled $ 431,000
and $ 442,000 , respectively, and were recorded in premises and occupancy expenses and equipment expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

period depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. The April 2022 stock repurchase plan will continue for a period of
one year
or until completed, whichever occurs first.
​ During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Corporation purchased

March 7, 2023 . ​ ​ ITEM 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. ("the Bank") upon the Bank’s conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank (“Conversion”). The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996. The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”). At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had total assets of $1.27 billion, total deposits of $945.3 million and total stockholders’ equity of $129.2 million. The Corporation has not engaged in any
33
Table of Contents significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Corporation” refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank’s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System since 1956. The Corporation operates in a single business segment through the Bank. The Bank’s activities include attracting deposits, offering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and, to a lesser extent, other mortgage, commercial business and consumer loans. Deposits are collected primarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. Loans are primarily originated and purchased in Southern and Northern California. There are various risks inherent in the Corporation’s business including, among others, the general business environment, interest rates, the California real estate market, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the repurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary market conditions to buy and sell loans, competitive conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks. The Corporation began to distribute quarterly cash dividends in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. On October 27, 2022, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share for the Corporation’s shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2022, which was paid on December 8, 2022. Future declarations or payments of dividends will be subject to the consideration of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, which will take into account the Corporation’s financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, legal restrictions, economic conditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying selected Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ Safe-Harbor Statement Certain matters in this Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Form 10-Q contains statements that the Corporation believes are “forward-looking statements.” These statements relate to the Corporation’s financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Corporation may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Corporation. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to the following: potential adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Corporation has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Corporation's business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth caused by increasing political instability from acts of war including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as increasing prices and supply chain disruptions, and any governmental or societal responses to new COVID-19 variants; the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and charge-offs and changes in our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses that may be impacted by deterioration in the residential and commercial real estate markets and may lead to increased losses and non-performing assets and may result in our allowance for loan losses not being adequate to cover actual losses and require us to materially increase our reserve; changes in the levels of general interest rates, and the relative differences between short and long term interest rates, deposit interest rates, our net interest margin and funding sources; the transition

These developments could have an adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations. Forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this document or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this document might not occur, and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These risks could cause our actual results for the remaining fiscal 2023 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect the Corporation’s consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations as well as its stock price performance. ​ Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Corporation’s critical accounting estimates are described in the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Form 10-K in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank, consist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the Bank. Community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Corporation’s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Also, to a lesser extent, the Corporation makes construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The primary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Additionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others. During the next three years, subject to market conditions, the Corporation intends to improve its community banking business by moderately increasing total assets (by increasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans). In addition, the Corporation intends to decrease the percentage of customer time deposits (excluding brokered deposits) in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of lower cost checking and savings accounts. This strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin and ultimately, coupled with the growth of the Corporation, an increase in net interest income. While the Corporation’s long-term strategy is for moderate growth, management recognizes that growth may be challenging given the current general economic conditions and risk of recession. Investment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to the Bank’s depositors. Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue. Provident Financial Corp performs trustee services for the Bank’s real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment. There are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, including: changes in accounting principles, laws, regulation, interest rates and the economy, including as a result of the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth, and any governmental or societal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. The California economic environment presents heightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Since the majority of the Corporation’s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the value of California real estate may also inhibit the Corporation’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate. The Corporation is actively monitoring and responding to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health, safety and well-being of its customers, employees and communities are the Corporation’s top priorities. As of December 31, 2022, all banking branches are open with normal business hours. The Bank will continue to monitor branch access and occupancy levels in relation to cases and close contact scenarios and follow governmental restrictions and public health authority guidelines. ​ 36
Table of Contents Commitments and Derivative Financial Instruments
The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale agreements to third parties and option contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. For a discussion on commitments and derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 Total assets increased seven percent to $1.27 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.19 billion at June 30, 2022. The increase was attributable to the increases in loans held for investment, partly offset by a decrease in investment securities. Total cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, increased $1.4 million, or six percent, to $24.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $23.4 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in total cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the management strategy on liquidity. Investment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased $17.8 million, or 10 percent, to $170.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $188.4 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed and other securities during the first six months of fiscal 2023. For further analysis on investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Loans held for investment increased $100.3 million, or 11 percent, to $1.04 billion at December 31, 2022 from $940.0 million at June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in single-family loans. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Corporation originated $158.9 million of loans held for investment, consisting primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans that are located throughout California. The Corporation did not purchase any loans from other institutions during the first six months of fiscal 2023. Total loan principal payments during the first six months of fiscal 2023 were $59.7 million, down 53 percent from $126.4 million during the comparable period in fiscal 2022. The single-family loans held for investment balance at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $479.7 million and $378.2 million, respectively, and represented approximately 46 percent and 40 percent of loans held for investment, respectively.
The tables below describe the geographic dispersion of gross real estate secured loans held for investment at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding: As of December 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Inland        Southern        Other        Other             ​             ​ ​ Empire ​ California (1) ​ California ​ States ​ Total ​ Loan Category      Balance      %        Balance      %        Balance      %        Balance      %        Balance      % ​ Single-family ​ $

For further analysis on loans held for investment, see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Total deposits decreased $10.2 million, or one percent, to $945.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $955.5 million at June 30, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in transaction accounts, partly offset by an increase in brokered time deposits. Time deposits increased $22.5 million, or 19 percent, to $143.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $121.1 million at June 30, 2022, while transaction accounts decreased $32.7 million, or four percent, to $801.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $834.4 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in time deposits was primarily due to a $31.2 million increase in brokered certificates of deposit with a weighted average cost of 2.90% (including broker fees). Excluding brokered deposits, the percentage of time deposits to total deposits decreased to 12 percent at December 31, 2022 from 13 percent at June 30, 2022. Brokered deposits totaled $31.2 million at December 31, 2022. Transaction account balances or “core deposits” decreased $32.7 million, or four percent, to $801.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $834.4 million at June 30, 2022 and time deposits increased $22.5 million, or 19 percent, to $143.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $121.1 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in time deposits was primarily due to a $31.2 million increase in brokered certificates of deposit with a weighted average cost of 2.90 percent (including broker fees). Total borrowings increased $95.0 million, or 112 percent, to $180.0 million at December 31, 2022 as compared to $85.0 million at June 30, 2022, due to additional short-term borrowings to fund the increase in loans held for investment. At December 31, 2022, borrowings are comprised of short-term and long-term FHLB - San Francisco advances used for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. Total stockholders’ equity increased to $129.2 million at December 31, 2022 from $128.7 million at June 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the $4.5 million net income and $385,000 of stock-based compensation in the first six months of fiscal 2023, partly offset by $2.0 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders and $2.2 million of stock repurchases. The Corporation repurchased 152,914 shares of its common stock under its April 2022 stock repurchase plan with a weighted average cost of $14.36 per share during the first six months of fiscal 2023. ​ Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarters and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The Corporation’s net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $2.4 million, up $107,000 or five percent from $2.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a $1.7 million increase in net interest income and a $101,000 decrease in non-interest expenses, partly offset by a $1.3 million change to the provision for loan losses to a $191,000 provision for loan losses this quarter in contrast to a $1.1 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses in the same quarter last year and a $412,000 decrease in non-interest income (mainly a decrease in loan prepayment fees). For the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Corporation’s net income was $4.5 million, a decrease of $470,000, or 10 percent, from $4.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a $1.7 million change to the provision for loan losses to a $261,000 provision for loan losses in the first six months of fiscal
38
Table of Contents 2023 in contrast to a $1.4 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses in the same period last year and a $1.2 million increase in non-interest expenses (mainly, the $1.2 million credit from the Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”) recognized in the second quarter of last year, not replicated this period) and a $478,000 decrease in non-interest income (mainly a decrease in loan prepayment fees), partly offset by a $2.8 million increase in net interest income. The Corporation’s efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, improved to 65.74 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from 76.39 percent in the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Corporation’s efficiency ratio also improved to 67.65 percent from 69.86 percent for the same period of fiscal 2022. The improvement in the efficiency ratio during the current quarter compared to the same quarter last year was due both to lower non-interest expenses and higher total revenues. The improvement in the efficiency ratio during the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period the prior year was due to higher total revenues, partly offset by higher non-interest expenses. Return on average assets
was 0.75 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, down slightly from 0.76 percent in the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, return on average assets was 0.72 percent, down 10 basis points from 0.82 percent in the same period last year. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 7.27 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up from 7.11 percent in the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, return on average stockholders’ equity was 6.85 percent, down from 7.75 percent for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $0.33, up 10 percent from diluted earnings per share of $0.30 in the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, diluted earnings per share were $0.61, down six percent from $0.65 in the same period last year. Net Interest Income: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Net interest income increased $1.7 million or 22 percent to $9.4 million from $7.7 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in net interest income was due to both higher net interest margin and, to a lesser extent, higher average earning assets. The higher net interest margin was
due to a shift in the composition of interest-earning assets towards higher yielding loans held for investment and an increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits reflecting recent increases in the targeted federal funds rate, including a 125-basis point increase during the current quarter, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%; partly offset by increases in the weighted average cost of customer deposits and borrowings. The net interest margin during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 41 basis points to 3.05 percent from 2.64 percent in the same quarter last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 70 basis points to 3.63 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from 2.93 percent in the same quarter last year while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 31 basis points to 0.63 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from 0.32 percent in the same quarter last year. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by six percent to $1.23 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $1.16 billion in the same quarter last year. The increase in earning assets was primiarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable, partly offset by decreases in the average balance of both investment securities and interest-earning deposits. For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Net interest income increased $2.8 million or 18 percent to $18.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $15.6 million in the same period in fiscal 2022, as a result of a higher net interest margin and, to a lesser extent, a higher average interest-earning asset balance. The net interest margin was 3.05 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2023, an increase of 38 basis points from 2.67 percent in the same period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets which exceeded the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 53 basis points to 3.50 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from 2.97 percent in the same period last year, while the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 17 basis points to 0.49 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2023 as compared to 0.32 percent in the same period last year. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $40.0 million, or three percent, to $1.20 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $1.16 billion in the comparable period of fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of loans receivable, partly offset by decreases in the average balance of both investment securities and interest earning deposits. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $39.7 million, or four percent, to $1.09 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2023
39
Table of Contents from $1.05 billion in the same period last year primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of borrowings and, to a lesser extent, the average balance of transaction accounts. ​ Interest Income: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Total interest income increased $2.7 million, or 32 percent, to $11.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $8.5 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from loans receivable. Interest income on loans receivable increased by $2.3 million, or 29 percent, to $10.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $7.9 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was due to a higher average balance and, to a lesser extent, a higher average yield. The average balance of loans receivable increased $167.4 million, or 20 percent, to $1.02 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $854.3 million in the same quarter last year. Total loans originated and purchased for investment in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $74.3 million, up 14 percent from $65.3 million in the same quarter last year. Loan principal payments received in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $28.0 million, down 61 percent from $72.5 million in the same quarter last year. The average yield on loans receivable increased by 30 basis points to 4.01 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from an average yield of 3.71 percent in the same quarter last year. Net deferred loan cost amortization in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 67 percent to $203,000 from $622,000 in the same quarter last year, attributable primarily to fewer loan payoffs. The higher weighted average loan yield was due primarily to the repricing of adjustable interest rate loans and the loan new originations with higher weighted average interest rates.
Interest income from investment securities increased by $115,000, or 27 percent, to $548,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $433,000 for the same quarter of fiscal 2022. This increase was attributable to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average yield on investment securities increased 42 basis points to 1.25 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from 0.83 percent for the same quarter last year. The increase in the average investment securities yield was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization during the current quarter in comparison to the same quarter last year ($203,000 vs. $443,000) attributable to a lower total principal repayment ($7.6 million vs. $15.5 million) and, to a lesser extent, the upward repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. The average balance of investment securities decreased by $34.5 million, or 16 percent, to $175.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $209.7 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in the average balance of investment securities was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. The FHLB – San Francisco distributed a $145,000 cash dividend to the Bank on its stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up 18 percent from $123,000 in the same quarter last year. The average balance of FHLB – San Francisco stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $8.2 million, virtually unchanged from the same quarter of fiscal 2022 while the average yield was 7.04 percent, up 101 basis points from 6.03 percent. Interest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was $241,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up 589 percent from $35,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was due to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 3.89 percent, up 374 basis points from 0.15 percent in the same quarter last year, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves. The average balance of the Company’s interest-earning deposits decreased by $66.8 million, or 73 percent, to $24.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $91.0 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to the utilization of these excess funds for loan portfolio growth. For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Total interest income increased $3.8 million, or 22 percent, to $21.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $17.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from loans receivable. ​ Interest income from loans receivable increased $3.2 million, or 20 percent, to $19.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $16.1 million for the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was due to a higher average balance and, to a lesser extent, a higher weighted average yield. The average balance of loans receivable increased by $137.6 million, or 16 percent, to $991.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $853.5 million in the same period of fiscal

Table of Contents 2022. Total loans originated and purchased for investment in the first six months of fiscal 2023 were $158.9 million, up 26 percent from $126.3 million in the same quarter last year. Loan principal payments received in the first six months of fiscal 2023 were $59.7 million, down 53 percent from $126.4 million in the same quarter last year. The weighted average loan receivable yield during the first six months of fiscal 2023 increased 13 basis points to 3.90 percent from 3.77 percent in the same period last year. The increase in the average yield on loans receivable was primarily attributable to loans repricing upward, new loan originations with a higher average yield and a decrease in net deferred loan cost amortization to $499,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $1.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2022.
​ Interest income from investment securities increased $233,000, or 27 percent, to $1.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $851,000 for the same period of fiscal 2022. This increase was attributable to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average investment securities yield increased by 42 basis points to 1.21 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from 0.79 percent in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase in the average investment securities yield was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization ($441,000 compared to $953,000) attributable to a lower total principal repayment ($16.9 million vs. $32.5 million) and, to a lesser extent, the upward repricing of adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities. The average balance of investment securities decreased by $35.0 million, or 16 percent, to $179.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $214.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. The decrease in the average balance of investment securities was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities.
​ The FHLB – San Francisco cash dividend received in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $268,000, up nine percent from $245,000 in the same period of fiscal 2022. The average balance of FHLB – San Francisco stock in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $8.2 million, virtually unchanged from the same period of fiscal 2022 while the average yield was 6.51 percent, up 50 basis points from 6.01 percent. ​ Interest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was $380,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2023, up 476 percent from $66,000 in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was due to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits increased by 296 basis points to 3.11 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from 0.15 percent in the comparable quarter last year, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves. The average balance of the interest-earning deposits in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $62.7 million or 72 percent, from $86.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. ​ Interest Expense: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Total interest expense increased by $938,000 or 111 percent to $1.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $848,000 in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense on borrowings and time deposits. Interest expense on deposits for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $475,000, a 57 percent increase from $302,000 for the same period last year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily attributable to a higher average balance and cost of time deposits.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $191,000, compared to a $1.1 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses recorded during the same quarter last year. Net loan recoveries for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $1,000, compared to net loan recoveries of $262,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The provision for loan losses primarily reflects an increase in loans held for investment in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 45
Table of Contents For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $261,000, compared to a recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $1.4 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. Net loan recoveries were $5,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net loan recoveries of $427,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The provision for loan losses primarily reflects an increase in loans held for investment in the first six months of fiscal 2023. ​ Non-performing assets, comprised solely of non-performing loans with underlying collateral located in California, decreased $467,000 or 33 percent to $956,000, or 0.08 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.4 million, or 0.12 percent of total assets, at June 30, 2022. The non-performing loans at December 31, 2022 are comprised of five single-family loans, while the non-performing loans at June 30, 2022 were comprised of seven single-family loans. At both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there was no real estate owned. Net loan recoveries for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $1,000 or 0.00 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable, as compared to net loan recoveries of $262,000 or 0.12 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net loan recoveries were $5,000 or 0.00 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable, as compared to net loan recoveries of $427,000 or 0.10 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Classified assets were $2.0 million at December 31, 2022 which consist of $514,000 of loans in the special mention category and $1.5 million of loans in the substandard category; while classified assets at June 30, 2022 were $1.6 million, consisting of $224,000 of loans in the special mention category and $1.4 million of loans in the substandard category. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was $5.8 million, comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of $5.8 million and individually evaluated allowances of $38,000; up five percent from $5.6 million at June 30, 2022. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 0.56 percent at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.59 percent at June 30, 2022. The allowance for loan losses was determined through quantitative and qualitative adjustments including the Bank’s charge-off experience and reflects the impact on loans held for investment from the current general economic conditions of the U.S. and California economies. Management considers, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment. See also, “Asset Quality” below and Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses. Non-Interest Income: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Non-interest income decreased by $412,000, or 30 percent, to $956,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $1.4 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in loan servicing and other fees. Loan servicing and other fees decreased $329,000 or 74 percent to $115,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $444,000 in the same quarter last year. The decrease was attributable primarily to lower loan prepayment fees resulting from fewer loan payoffs, particularly in multi-family loans. Total loan prepayment fees in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $64,000, down $319,000 or 83 percent from $383,000 in the same quarter last year. Total loan repayments were $28.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, down 61 percent from $72.5 million in the same quarter last year. Other changes in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022, included a $32,000 or eight percent decrease in card and processing fees due to fewer transactions and a $53,000 or 27 percent decrease in other non-interest income. For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Total non-interest income decreased $478,000, or 20 percent, to $2.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $2.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in loan servicing and other fees. ​ Loan servicing and other fees decreased by $407,000 or 65 percent to $223,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $630,000 in the same period last year. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in loan prepayment fees resulting
46
Table of Contents from fewer loan payoffs, particularly in multi-family loans. Total loan prepayment fees in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $223,000, down $373,000 or 63 percent from $596,000 in the same period last year. Total loan repayments were $59.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023, down 53 percent from $126.4 million in the same period last year. Other changes in non-interest income during the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, included a $56,000 or seven percent decrease in card and processing fees. ​ Non-Interest Expense: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Non-interest expenses decreased by $101,000 or one percent to $6.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $6.9 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease in the non-interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits expenses and lower equipment expenses. For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Total non-interest expense in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $13.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or nine percent, as compared to $12.6 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and, to a lesser extent, increases in professional and other non-interest expenses. ​ Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $948,000, or 13 percent, to $8.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $7.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was due primarily to the $1.2 million ERTC recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and not replicated in fiscal 2023. ​ Professional expenses increased $93,000, or 11 percent, to $902,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $809,000 in the same period last year, primarily attributable to higher legal expenses. ​ Other non-interest expenses increased by $138,000, or 10 percent, to $1.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 from $1.4 million in the same period last year, primarily attributable to the recognition of a $125,000 recovery on a fraudulent deposited item recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and not replicated this period.
​ Provision for Income Taxes: The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation, earnings from bank-owned life insurance policies and certain California tax-exempt loans, among others. Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax. For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The Corporation’s income tax provision was $981,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up five percent from $935,000 in the same quarter last year primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 29.3 percent as compared to 29.2 percent in the same quarter last year. For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   The Corporation’s income tax provision was $1.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023, a three percent decrease from $1.9 million in the same period last year, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 29.3 percent and 27.8 percent, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate in the first six months of fiscal 2022 was attributable primarily to the tax benefits from the non-taxable treatment of the ERTC for state income tax purposes. The Corporation believes that the effective income tax rates applied in the first six months of fiscal 2023 reflect its current income tax obligations. ​ ​ Asset Quality Non-performing assets were comprised solely of non-performing loans at both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Non-performing loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, consisting of loans with collateral located in California, were
47
Table of Contents $956,000 at December 31, 2022, down 33 percent from $1.4 million at June 30, 2022. Non-performing loans as a percentage of loans held for investment at December 31, 2022 was 0.09%, down from 0.15% at June 30, 2022. The non-performing loans at December 31, 2022 were comprised of five single-family loans; while the non-performing loans at June 30, 2022 were comprised of seven single-family loans. No interest accruals were made for loans that were past due 90 days or more or if the loans were deemed non-performing. There was no real estate owned at either December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, total restructured loans were $972,000, down 78 percent from $4.5 million at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, a total of $714,000 or 73 percent of these restructured loans were classified as non-performing; while at June 30, 2022, a total of $722,000 or 16 percent of these restructured loans were classified as non-performing. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, all of the restructured loans had a current payment status, consistent with their modified payment terms. Restructured loans which are performing in accordance with their modified terms and not otherwise classified as non-accrual are not included in non-performing assets. For further analysis on non-performing loans and restructured loans, see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. A decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of the Corporation’s real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Corporation’s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, fires and national disasters particular to California where substantially all of the Corporation’s real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline, the value of the real estate collateral securing the Corporation’s loans as set forth in the table could be significantly overstated. The Corporation’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The Corporation generally does not update the loan-to-value ratio on its loans held for investment by obtaining new appraisals or broker price opinions (nor does the Corporation intend to do so in the future as a result of the costs and inefficiencies associated with completing the task) unless a specific loan has demonstrated deterioration in which case individually evaluated allowances are established, if required. 48

While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The primary investing activity of the Corporation is the origination and purchase of loans held for investment. During the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Corporation originated and purchased loans held for investment of $158.9 million and $126.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had loan origination commitments totaling $8.4 million, undisbursed lines of credit totaling $1.2 million and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling $3.3 million. The Corporation anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments. During the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, total loan repayments were $59.7 million and $126.4 million, respectively. The Corporation’s primary financing activity is gathering deposits. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the net decrease in deposits was $10.2 million or one percent, due primarily to a decrease in transaction accounts, partly offset by
50
Table of Contents an increase in time deposits. Transaction account balances decreased $32.7 million, or four percent, to $801.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $834.4 million at June 30, 2022, while time deposits increased $22.5 million, or 19 percent, to $143.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $121.1 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in time deposits was due to brokered certificates of deposit totaling $31.2 million issued in the first six months of fiscal 2023. At December 31, 2022, time deposits with a principal amount of $250,000 or less and scheduled to mature in one year or less were $87.0 million and total time deposits with a principal amount of more than $250,000 and scheduled to mature in one year or less were $16.0 million. Historically, the Corporation has been able to retain a significant percentage of its time deposits as they mature. The Corporation must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Corporation generally maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2022, total cash and cash equivalents were $24.8 million, or two percent of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products and the FHLB – San Francisco advances, the Bank may rely on FHLB – San Francisco advances for part of its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2022, total borrowings were $180.0 million and the financing availability at the FHLB – San Francisco was limited to 35 percent of total assets. As a result, the remaining borrowing facility available was $237.8 million and the remaining available collateral was $214.8 million. In addition, the Bank has secured a $134.2 million discount window facility at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities with a fair market value of $142.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank also has a borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under its correspondent bank or discount window facility as of December 31, 2022. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Corporation purchased 152,914 shares of the Corporation’s common stock under the April 2022 stock repurchase plan with a weighted average cost of $14.36 per share. As of December 31, 2022, there are 211,345 shares available for purchase until the plan expires on April 28, 2023. The Corporation purchases the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. Regulations require thrifts to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank’s average liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 19.3 percent from 24.3 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the OCC. Under the OCC’s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank was categorized "well-capitalized" at December 31, 2022 under the regulations of the OCC. As a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve. For a bank holding company with less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company’s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. 51

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend if the effect thereof would cause its net worth to be reduced below the regulatory capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Bank paid a cash dividend of $9.5 million to the Corporation, while the Corporation paid $2.0 million of cash dividends to its shareholders. ​ Supplemental Information ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ At ​ At ​ At ​ ​ December 31,  ​ June 30,  ​ December 31,  ​ ​ 2022 ​ 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Loans serviced for others (in thousands) ​ $

17.31 ​ ​ ​ ​ ITEM 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. One of the Corporation’s principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The Corporation has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest-rate sensitivity of the Corporation’s interest-earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions. 52
Table of Contents In addition, the Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, which is largely in U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently or have a relatively short average life. The Corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing FHLB – San Francisco advances and, from time to time, brokered deposits as a secondary source of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered deposits, reduces the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to seven years. Through the use of an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the change in net portfolio value (“NPV”) over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The calculation is intended to illustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -200, -100, +100, +200 and +300 basis points (“bp”) with no effect given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movement. As of December 31, 2022, the targeted federal funds rate range was 4.25% to 4.50%. The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the NPV based on the indicated changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Net      ​ ​      Portfolio      NPV as Percentage      ​ ​ Basis Points ("bp") ​ Portfolio ​ NPV ​ Value of ​ of Portfolio Value ​ Sensitivity ​

(2) Derived from the NPV divided by the portfolio value of total assets. (3) Derived from the change in the NPV as Percentage of Portfolio Value Assets from the base case ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates (expressed in basis points). The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a -200 basis point rate shock at December 31, 2022 and at a -100 basis point rate shock at June 30, 2022. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      At December 31, 2022      At June 30, 2022   ​   (-200 bp rate shock)   (-100 bp rate shock) ​ Pre-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets   11.35 % ​ 8.87 % ​ Post-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a % of PV Assets   9.37 % ​ 8.54 % ​ Sensitivity Measure: Change in NPV Ratio   -198 bp   -33 bp ​ ​ The pre-shock NPV ratio increased 248 basis points to 11.35 percent at December 31, 2022 from 8.87 percent at June 30, 2022 and the post-shock NPV ratio increased 83 basis points to 9.37 percent at December 31, 2022 from 8.54 percent at June 30, 2022. The increase of the NPV ratios was primarily attributable to the changes in market interest rates, the composition of the balance sheet and net income in the first six months of fiscal 2023, partly offset by a $9.5 million cash dividend distribution from the Bank to the Corporation in September 2022. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate
53
Table of Contents mortgage (“ARM”) loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM loans could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation. The Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity "gap" analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest rates. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual repricing or scheduled maturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits) that have no contractual maturity, the table presents estimated principal cash flows and, as applicable, the Corporation’s historical experience, management’s judgment and statistical analysis concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. 54

accounts (checking, savings and money market deposits) are presented as estimated repricing; while time deposits (without consideration for early withdrawals) and borrowings are presented as contractual maturities. The static gap analysis shows a negative position in the 12 months or less "cumulative repricing gap - dollar amount" category, indicating more liabilities are sensitive to repricing than assets. Management views non interest-bearing checking deposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term funding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity for savings and money market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances are assumed to be subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15% per year, savings deposits at 20% per year and money market deposits at 50% in the first and second years. The gap results presented above could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the preparation of the gap analysis. Furthermore, the gap analysis provides a static view of interest rate risk exposure at a specific point in time without taking into account redirection of cash flows activity and deposit fluctuations. 55
Table of Contents The extent to which the net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of factors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in the market rates of interest. Additionally, prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the relationship between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the previous table, is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted solely on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the previous table. The Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items: ● The Corporation’s current balance sheet and repricing characteristics; ● Forecast balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan; ● Current interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates; ● Embedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps; ● Repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments; ● Loan, investment, deposit and borrowing cash flows; ● Loan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; and ● Immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus 300, 200 and 100 and minus 100 and 200 basis points. The following table describes the results of the analysis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ At December 31, 2022 ​ At June 30, 2022   Basis Point (bp) ​ Change in ​ Basis Point (bp) ​ Change in

Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. At June 30, 2022, the Corporation was asset sensitive as its interest-earning assets at this date were expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12 month period. Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projected an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12 month period. In a falling interest rate environment, the results projected a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. Management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable. However, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore, the model results that the Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporation’s current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve. ​ ​ 56
Table of Contents ITEM 4 – Controls and Procedures. (a)    An evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Corporation’s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. (b)    There have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ​ ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the Corporation’s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the Corporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows. ​ ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Form 10-K. 57
