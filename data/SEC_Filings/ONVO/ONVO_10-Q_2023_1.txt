Organovo Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Con solidated Financial Statements
Note
1. Description of Business
Nature of Operations Organovo Holdings, Inc. (“Organovo Holdings,” “Organovo,” and the “Company”) is an early-stage biotechnology company that focuses on building high fidelity, 3D tissues that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. The Company uses these models to identify gene targets responsible for driving the disease and intends to initiate drug discovery programs around these validated targets. The Company is initially focusing on the intestine and has ongoing 3D tissue development efforts in ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”). Recently, the Company announced that it has successfully advanced its first inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”) model to the next step of target discovery and validation for CD. The Company intends to add additional tissues/diseases/targets to its portfolio over time. In line with these plans, the Company is building upon both its external and in house scientific expertise, which will be essential to its drug development effort. The Company uses its proprietary technology to build functional 3D human tissues that mimic key aspects of native human tissue composition, architecture, function and disease. Organovo’s advances include cell type-specific compartments, prevalent intercellular tight junctions, and the formation of microvascular structures. Management believes these attributes can enable critical complex, multicellular disease models that can be used to develop clinically effective drugs across multiple therapeutic areas. The Company’s NovoGen Bioprinters ®
are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. The Company believes that the use of its bioprinting platform as well as complementary 3D technologies will allow it to develop an understanding of disease biology that leads to validated novel drug targets and therapeutics to those targets to treat disease.
The majority of the Company’s current focus is in IBD, including CD and UC. The Company is creating high fidelity disease models, leveraging its prior work including the work found in its peer-reviewed publication on bioprinted intestinal tissues ( Madden et al. Bioprinted 3D Primary Human Intestinal Tissues Model Aspects of Native Physiology and ADME/Tox Functions. iScience. 2018 Apr 27;2:156-167. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2018.03.015.) The Company’s current understanding of intestinal tissue models and IBD disease models leads it to believe that it can create models that provide greater insight into the biology of these diseases than are generally currently available. Using these disease models, the Company has identified and validated novel therapeutic targets and is actively focused on developing novel small molecule, antibody, or other therapeutic drug candidates to treat the disease, and advance these novel drug candidates towards an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing and potential future clinical trials.
The Company expects to broaden its work into additional therapeutic areas over time and is currently exploring specific tissues for development. In the Company’s work to identify the areas of interest, it evaluates areas that might be better served with 3D disease models than currently available models as well as the potential commercial opportunity. Except where specifically noted or the context otherwise requires, references to “Organovo Holdings”, “the Company”, and “Organovo” in these notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements refers to Organovo Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Organovo, Inc., and Opal Merger Sub, Inc.   COVID-19 Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty.
The extent to which the coronavirus impacts the Company’s operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the rise of vaccine-resistant variants, the duration of the outbreak, and any
travel bans and restrictions or other limitations that may be imposed in the future . In particular, the continued coronavirus pandemic could adversely impact various aspects of the Company’s operations, including among others, the ability to raise additional capital, the timing and ability to pursue the Company’s strategy, given the impact the pandemic may have on the manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations of potential strategic partners, and the ability to advance its research and development activities and pursue development of its pipeline products, each of which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results. Company employees and consultants have returned to working at the office and lab when necessary. The Company has developed guidelines and protocols to handle exposures and infections to keep disruptions to operations to a minimum.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not necessarily include all information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2022 is derived from the Company’s audited consolidated balance sheet at that date.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Organovo and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments, which are only normal and recurring, necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any other interim period or the Company’s full fiscal year ending March 31, 2023
(see “Note 1. Description of Business”).   Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 20.2
million, restricted cash of approximately $ 0.1
million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 317.5
million. The restricted cash was pledged as collateral for a letter of credit that the Company is required to maintain as a security deposit under the terms of the lease agreement for its facilities. The Company also had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $ 7.7
million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Through December 31, 2022, the Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of convertible notes, warrants, the private placement of equity securities, the sale of common stock through public and at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings, and through revenue derived from product and research service-based agreements, collaborative agreements, licenses, and grants. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued
zero
shares of its common stock through its ATM facility. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet its financial obligations for at least the next 12 months of operations. As the Company continues to focus its efforts on drug discovery and development, it will need to raise additional capital to implement this business plan. The Company cannot predict with certainty the exact amount or timing for any future capital raises. If required, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings, or through some other financing arrangement. However, the Company cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if and when needed, or that, if available, it can obtain financing on terms favorable to its stockholders. Any failure to obtain financing when required will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates used in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include those assumed in revenue recognition and the valuation of stock-based compensation expense. On an ongoing basis, management reviews these estimates and assumptions. Though the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to its business and operating results presents additional uncertainty, the Company continues to use the best information available to inform its significant accounting estimates. Investments
Investments consist of investments in debt securities, specifically in U.S. Treasury bills. Any investments that have original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to December 31, 2022, the Company classified all investments as held-to-maturity. All investments previously classified as held-to-maturity matured prior to December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, all investments are classified as available-for-sale, as the sale of such investments may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders' equity until realized. As U.S. Treasury bills are risk-free, any declines in fair value are considered temporary.
8
Investments in equity securities consist of investments in the common stock of entities traded in active markets. The Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over any entities. Therefore, initial investments are recorded at cost, and are remeasured at fair value as of the balance sheet date. Any gains or losses resulting from the change in fair value are recorded in net income. The investments in equity securities are classified as current assets. Fair value measurement
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, which is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following is a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:
• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company held investments in 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, which are all considered cash equivalents. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Please refer to "Note 3. Investments” for further information. As the investments consist of U.S. Treasury bills from active markets, the fair value is measured using level 1 inputs. The following table summarizes the Company's investments that are measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)

Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares used to compute diluted loss per share excludes any assumed exercise of stock options, shares reserved for purchase under the Company’s 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), the assumed vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and shares subject to repurchase as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
No
dilutive effect was calculated for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as the Company reported a net loss for each respective period and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents excluded from computing diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive effect were approximately
1.5
million at December 31, 2022 and
1.1
million at December 31, 2021.
Revenue recognition The Company generates revenues from the licensing of intellectual property.
Licenses The Company has entered into a license agreement with a company that includes the following:
(i) non-refundable upfront fees and (ii) royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales, if any. At the initiation of the agreement, the Company has analyzed whether it results in a contract with a customer under Topic 606. The Company has considered a variety of factors in determining the appropriate estimates and assumptions under these arrangements, such as whether the Company is a principal vs. agent, whether the elements are distinct performance obligations, whether there are determinable stand-alone prices, and whether any licenses are functional or symbolic. The Company has evaluated each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied and recognized as revenue at a point in time or over time. Typically, non-refundable upfront fees have been considered fixed, while sales-based royalty payments have been identified as variable consideration which must be evaluated to determine if it has been constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price. Please refer to “Note 5: Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreements” for further information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies. Unless otherwise stated, the Company believes that the impact of the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Note 3. Investments Investments consist of investments in debt securities, specifically in U.S. Treasury bills. There were less than $ 0.1
million of unrealized gains recorded on investments for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held $ 10.0
million of investments in 3-month treasury bills (which are included in the $ 20.2
million of cash and cash equivalents). For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, there was less than $ 0.1
million and $ 0.2
million of interest income related to the investments, respectively.
Investments in equity securities consist of investments in the common stock of an entity traded in active markets. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, there was $ 1.1
million of equity securities purchased, and $ 0.4
million of equity securities sold. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of investment in equity securities was $ 0.6
million, resulting in a $ 0.1
million unrealized loss on investment in equity securities.
Note 4. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock-based Compensation Expense and Valuation Information Stock-based awards include stock options and RSUs under the Company’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan ("2022 Plan"), Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), inducement awards, performance-based RSUs under an Incentive Award Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, the Company’s 2021 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (“Inducement Plan”), and rights to purchase stock under the ESPP. The Company calculates the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards in determining the stock-based compensation expense.

The total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option grants as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 2.9
million and the weighted average period over which these grants are expected to vest is
2.16
years. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs (not including performance-based RSUs) as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 0.3
million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.41
years.   The Company uses either the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo option-pricing models to calculate the fair value of stock options, depending on the complexity of the equity grants. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period using the straight-line method. The assumed dividend yield is based on the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company uses the Company-specific historical volatility rate as the indicator of expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on U.S. Treasury rates. The weighted average expected life of options was estimated using the average of the contractual term and the weighted average vesting term of the options. The measurement and classification of share-based payments to non-employees is consistent with the measurement and classification of share-based payments to employees.
The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions:

The fair value of each RSU and performance-based RSU is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term of the award. The fair value is based on the closing stock price on the date of the grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of shares issued pursuant to the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the purchase period using the straight-line method.

*There were no participants in the ESPP for the purchase periods beginning March 1, 2021 or September 1, 2021. The assumed dividend yield is based on the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company uses the Company-specific historical volatility rate as the indicator of expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on U.S. Treasury rates. The expected life is the
6 -month purchase period. There was
one
participant in the ESPP for the current purchase period (beginning September 1, 2022). 11
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue
25,000,000
shares of preferred stock. There are
no
shares of preferred stock currently outstanding, and the Company has no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock.
Common Stock In March 2021, the Company's Board of Directors ("Board") approved the Inducement Plan. The Inducement Plan authorized the issuance of up to
750,000
shares of common stock for awards of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance units, performance shares, and other stock or cash awards. On October 12, 2022, the Company's stockholders and the Board approved the 2022 Plan, and it became effective on that date. The 2022 Plan replaced the 2012 Plan on the effective date. Upon the effective date, the Company ceased granting awards under the 2012 Plan and any shares remaining available for future issuance under the 2012 Plan were cancelled and are no longer available for future issuance. The 2012 Plan continues to govern awards previously granted under it. At the time the Board approved the 2022 Plan, an aggregate of
1,363,000
shares of the Company’s common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan. The Company committed to reducing the new 2022 Plan share reserve by the number of shares that were granted under the 2012 Plan and the Inducement Plan between July 25, 2022 and October 12, 2022. From July 25, 2022 to October 12, 2022, the Company issued
126,262
shares of its common stock under the 2012 Plan. As a result, the number of shares reserved for future issuance under the 2022 Plan is
1,236,738
shares of common stock. The Company also committed to reducing the aggregate number of shares of its common stock issuable pursuant to the Inducement Plan from
750,000
shares to
51,000
shares (which includes
50,000
shares of its common stock issuable pursuant to an outstanding option to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $ 2.75
per share, leaving only
1,000
shares available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan) and the share reserve was reduced effective October 12, 2022. The Company previously had an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222929) and the related prospectus previously declared effective by the SEC on February 22, 2018 (the “2018 Shelf”), which registered $ 100.0
million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and units, or any combination of the foregoing, that was set to expire on
February 22, 2021 . On January 19, 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252224) to register $ 150.0
million of the Company’s common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, or any combination of the foregoing (the “2021 Shelf”) and a related prospectus. The 2021 Shelf was declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2021 and replaced the 2018 Shelf at that time.
On March 16, 2018, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (“Sales Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC and Jones Trading Institutional Services LLC (each an “Agent” and together, the “Agents”). On January 29, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the 2021 Shelf (the “ATM Prospectus Supplement”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the Agents, shares of its common stock in ATM sales transactions having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 50.0
million. Any shares offered and sold will be issued pursuant to the 2021 Shelf. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued
zero
shares of common stock in ATM offerings under the ATM Prospectus Supplement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has sold an aggregate of
1,580,862
shares of common stock in ATM offerings under the ATM Prospectus Supplement, with gross proceeds of approximately $ 21.7
million. As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 100.0
million available for future offerings under the 2021 Shelf (excluding amounts available but not yet issued under the ATM Prospectus Supplement), and approximately $ 28.3
million available for future offerings through the Company’s ATM program under the ATM Prospectus Supplement.

Stock Options
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, under both the 2022 Plan and 2012 Plan,
9,553
and
209,474
stock options were granted at various exercise prices, respectively.   On October 7, 2021, the Company granted
30,000
and
7,500
stock options, respectively, to its Executive Chairman and its Chief Scientific Officer under the 2012 Plan. These stock options have unique vesting criteria based on specific Company performance conditions. The vesting criteria relates to the Company closing a seven-figure cash up front deal with a major pharmaceutical company. As of December 31, 2022, management estimated there was a
0 % probability of achievement, and therefore
no
expense has been recorded to date. The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity from March 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan In June 2016,
the Board adopted, and in August 2016, the Company’s stockholders subsequently approved, the ESPP. The Company reserved
75,000
shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The ESPP permits employees after five months of service to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, limited to
15
percent of each employee’s compensation up to $ 25,000
per employee per year or
500
shares per employee per six-month purchase period.
Shares under the ESPP are purchased at
85
percent of the fair market value at the lower of (i) the closing price on the first trading day of the six-month purchase period or (ii) the closing price on the last trading day of the
six-month
purchase period.
The initial offering period commenced in
September 2016 . At December 31, 2022, there were
59,435

Note 5. Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreements
License Agreements From June 2021 to February 2022, certain patents owned or sublicensed by the Company became the subject of IPR proceedings filed by Cellink AB and its subsidiaries, MatTek Incorporated and Visikol, Inc. (collectively, “BICO Group AB”). The Company and BICO Group AB were also engaged in litigation regarding patent infringement during the same time period. On February 22, 2022, the Company and BICO Group AB signed a settlement and patent license agreement (“License Agreement”) to close all matters noted above. In addition to closing all legal matters and patent disputes noted above, as part of the agreement, the Company agreed to grant a non-exclusive license to BICO Group AB to use the Company’s aforementioned patents for its business operations of manufacturing and selling bioprinters as well as bioinks. The Company concluded that the nature of the license granted represents functional intellectual property.
As part of the License Agreement, BICO Group AB agreed to pay the Company a one-time, nonrefundable upfront fee of $ 1,500,000 . Based on Topic 606, the Company concluded that the performance obligation related to this upfront fee consisted of the Company filing stipulations of dismissal of all legal matters noted above, as well as the Company granting the non-exclusive license of the aforementioned patents within five days of receiving the upfront payment. The conditions of the performance obligation were satisfied, and therefore the Company recognized revenue of $ 1,500,000
on February 22, 2022, the executed date of the License Agreement.
Additionally, as part of the License Agreement, BICO Group AB agreed to pay the Company ongoing sales-based royalties (based on percentages of BICO Group AB’s net sales) for the use of the granted license. The sales-based royalties became effective beginning on February 22, 2022, the effective date of the License Agreement, and continue until the expiration of the last surviving licensed patent. As the sales-based royalties are required to be paid 45 days after the end of every quarter, there is variable consideration that must be estimated to determine royalty revenue within a given reporting period. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 131,000
of royalty revenue based on sales-based royalties from the License Agreement. This recognized revenue is related to sales-based royalties earned from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. In previous quarters, the Company recognized sales-based royalties on a one quarter lag due to constraints on the estimates of variable consideration. As of the current quarter, the Company began to estimate sales-based royalties earned during the quarter. Of the $ 131,000
royalty revenue recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022, $ 61,000
relates to sales-based royalties earned from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 208,000
royalty revenue based on sales-based royalties from the License Agreement. This recognized revenue is related to sales-based royalties earned from February 22, 2022 through December 31, 2022.   Also as part of the License Agreement, certain patents involved in the agreement are sublicensed by the Company from the University of Missouri and Clemson University. See below for further information.
University of Missouri In March 2009, the Company entered into a license agreement with the Curators of the University of Missouri to in-license certain technology and intellectual property relating to self-assembling cell aggregates and to intermediate cellular units. The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize products comprising this technology for all fields of use. The Company is required to pay the University of Missouri royalties ranging from
1 % to
3 % of net sales of covered tissue products, and of the fair market value of covered tissues transferred internally for use in the Company’s commercial service business, depending on the level of net sales achieved by the Company each year. The Company paid minimum annual royalties of $ 25,000
in January 2022 and January 2021 for their respective calendar years, which is credited against royalties due during the subsequent twelve months.
No
payments have been made in excess of the minimum annual royalties in the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
The license agreement with the University of Missouri also includes an additional sales royalty of
3 % of all revenue received from a sublicensee, when such sublicense is entered pursuant to settlement of litigation. Such revenue shall include, but not be limited to, all option fees, license issue fees (up-front payments), license maintenance fees, equity, and all royalty payments. Such revenue shall not include research funding provided to licensee by sublicensee. However, per the agreement, in the event that the Company defends the technology by litigation, it can offset any royalties due by legal expenses incurred. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s legal expenses exceeded royalties owed from the upfront payment and sales-based royalties related to the License Agreement. Therefore,
no
royalty expense to the University of Missouri was recorded for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
No
royalty expense related to sales-based royalties has been recorded to date.
On December 5, 2022, the Company amended the license agreement with the University of Missouri, whereas the Company agreed to pay a single, up-front payment of $ 50,000
to the University of Missouri in exchange for the aforementioned licensed intellectual property to be fully paid up by the Company. As a result, the Company will continue to have rights to the licensed intellectual property until its expiration, but will no longer owe minimum annual royalty payments, royalty payments based on net sales, or any other payments (other than patent annuities and any prosecution costs) in the future. 14
Clemson University In May 2011, the Company entered into a license agreement with Clemson University Research Foundation to in-license certain technology and intellectual property relating to ink-jet printing of viable cells. The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize products comprising this technology for all fields of use. The Company is required to pay the university royalties ranging from
1.5 % to
3 % of net sales of covered tissue products and the fair market value of covered tissues transferred internally for use in the Company’s commercial service business, depending on the level of net sales reached each year. The license agreement terminates upon expiration of the patents licensed, which are expected to expire in
May 2024 , and is subject to certain conditions as defined in the license agreement. Minimum annual royalty payments of $ 20,000
were due for each of the two years beginning with calendar 2014, and $ 40,000
per year beginning with calendar 2016. Royalty payments of $ 40,000
were made in each of the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The annual minimum royalty is creditable against royalties owed during the same calendar year.
In addition to the annual royalties noted above, the University is owed
40 % of all payments including but not limited to, upfront payments, license fees, issue fees, maintenance fees, and milestone payments received from third parties, including sublicensees, in consideration for sublicensing rights to licensed products. However, per the agreement, in the event that the Company defends the technology by litigation, it can offset any royalties due by legal expenses incurred. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s legal expenses exceeded royalties owed from the upfront payment and sales-based royalties related to the License Agreement. Therefore,
no
royalty expense to Clemson University was recorded for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
No
royalty expense related to sales-based royalties has been recorded to date.
Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject, from time to time, to various claims and pending and potential legal actions arising out of the normal conduct of its business.
The Company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in its financial statements. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing litigation contingencies is subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating contingencies, the Company may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against it may be unsupported, exaggerated or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of its potential liability. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of its accruals and related disclosures. During the period presented, the Company has not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with any claims or legal proceedings. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Note 7. Leases After the initial adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”), on an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all contracts upon inception and determines whether the contract contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If a lease is identified, the Company will apply the guidance from ASC 842 to properly account for the lease. Operating Leases   From October 2019 to July 2021, the Company rented office space in Solana Beach, California. This agreement was a month-to-month contract and could be terminated at-will by either party at any time. As such, the Company concluded that this agreement did not contain a lease and was expensed as incurred (referred to as “rent expense”). Monthly rental payments were approximately $ 4,000
per month. 15
On November 23, 2020, the Company entered into
two
lease agreements, pursuant to which the Company temporarily leased approximately
3,212
square feet of lab and office space (the “Temporary Lease”) in San Diego and permanently leased approximately
8,051
square feet of lab and office space (the “Permanent Lease”) in San Diego once certain tenant improvements for the Company’s permanent premises were completed by the landlord and the premises were ready for occupancy. Additionally, on November 17, 2021, the Permanent Lease was amended to add an additional
2,892
square feet of office space in the same building. The Temporary Lease commenced on November 27, 2020 and served as temporary premises until the Permanent Lease was ready for occupancy. The Permanent Lease commenced on December 17, 2021 and is intended to serve as the Company’s permanent premises for approximately
sixty-two months . Monthly rental payments will be approximately $ 40,800
with
3 % annual escalators.
The Company determined that the Temporary Lease is considered a short term lease under ASC 842 and therefore elected an accounting policy for short term leases to recognize lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term (referred to as “short term lease expense”). Variable lease expenses related to the short term lease, such as payments for additional monthly fees to cover the Company’s share of certain facility expenses (common area maintenance, or CAM) are expensed as incurred.
The Company determined that the Permanent Lease is considered an operating lease under ASC 842, and therefore upon the lease commencement date of December 17, 2021, recognized lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets of $ 2.3
million. The Company records operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease (referred to as “operating lease expense”). Variable lease expenses associated with the Company’s leases, such as payments for additional monthly fees to cover the Company’s share of certain facility expenses (common area maintenance, or CAM) are expensed as incurred.

Note 8. Concentrations
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash and short-term investments. The Company maintains cash and investment balances at various financial institutions located within the United States. Accounts at these institutions are secured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Note 9. Related Parties From time to time, the Company will enter into an agreement with a related party in the ordinary course of its business. These agreements are ratified by the Board or a committee thereof pursuant to its related party transaction policy.
Viscient Biosciences (“Viscient”) is an entity for which Keith Murphy, the Company’s Executive Chairman, serves as the Chief Executive Officer and President. Dr. Jeffrey Miner, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is also the Chief Scientific Officer of Viscient, and Thomas Jurgensen, the Company’s General Counsel, previously served as outside legal counsel to Viscient through his law firm, Optima Law Group, APC.
On December 28, 2020, the Company entered into an intercompany agreement (the “Intercompany Agreement”) with Viscient and Organovo, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, which included an asset purchase agreement for certain lab equipment. Pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement, the Company agreed to provide Viscient certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, which includes, but is not limited to, histology services, cell isolation, and proliferation of cells and Viscient agreed to provide the Company certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, including bioprinter training, bioprinting services, and qPCR assays, in each case on payment terms specified in the Intercompany Agreement and as may be further determined by the parties. In addition, the Company and Viscient each agreed to share certain facilities and equipment and, subject to further agreement, to each make certain employees available for specified projects for the other party at prices to be determined in good faith by the parties. The Company evaluated the accounting for the Intercompany Agreement and concluded that any services provided by Viscient to the Company will be expensed as incurred, and any compensation for services provided by the Company to Viscient will be considered a reduction of personnel related expenses. Any services provided to Viscient do not fall under Topic 606 as the Intercompany Agreement is not a contract with a customer. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred
no
consulting expenses from Viscient. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company provided approximately $ 17,000
and $ 44,000
of histology services to Viscient, respectively.
Note 10. Subsequent Events On February 8, 2023, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with Metacrine, Inc., pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate a definitive asset purchase agreement (the "Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet contemplates that the Company will acquire Metacrine's FXR program from Metacrine in consideration of cash payments totaling $ 4
million. The proposed transaction is subject to certain contingencies, including completion of due diligence and the execution of a definitive agreement. The parties expect to sign and close the transaction prior to March 31, 2023.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) instructions to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and discussed below are unaudited and do not contain all the information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to be included in a full set of financial statements. The audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on Form 10-K on June 10, 2022, include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in this Form 10-Q. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year.
Overview
We are an early-stage biotechnology company that is focusing on building high fidelity, 3D tissues that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. We use these models to identify gene targets responsible for driving the disease and intend to initiate drug discovery programs around these validated targets. We are initially focusing on the intestine and have ongoing 3D tissue development efforts in ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”). Recently, we announced that we have successfully advanced our first inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”) model to the next step of target discovery and validation for CD. We intend to add additional tissues/diseases/targets to our portfolio over time. In line with these plans, we are building upon both our external and in-house scientific expertise, which will be essential to our drug development effort. In addition, we are exploring opportunities to acquire clinical stage assets (Phase I and II) that are complementary to our therapeutic areas of interest and that can be taken through the FDA process and into the market on a faster timeline than our internally developed molecules. If such opportunities become part of our pipeline, we would expect to continue development of additional therapeutics from internal research along the current base case plan.
We use our proprietary technology to build functional 3D human tissues that mimic key aspects of native human tissue composition, architecture, function and disease. Our advances include cell type-specific compartments, prevalent intercellular tight junctions, and the formation of microvascular structures. Management believes these attributes can enable critical complex, multicellular disease models that can be used to develop clinically effective drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.
Our NovoGen Bioprinters ®
are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform as well as complementary 3D technologies will allow us to develop an understanding of disease biology that leads to validated novel drug targets, and
therapeutics to those targets to treat disease.
18
The majority of our current focus is on IBD, including CD and UC. We are creating high fidelity disease models, leveraging our prior work including the work found in our peer-reviewed publication on bioprinted intestinal tissues ( Madden et al. Bioprinted 3D Primary Human Intestinal Tissues Model Aspects of Native Physiology and ADME/Tox Functions. iScience. 2018 Apr 27;2:156-167. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2018.03.015.)
Our current understanding of intestinal tissue models and IBD disease models leads us to believe that we can create models that provide greater insight into the biology of these diseases than are generally currently available. Using these disease models, we have identified and validated novel therapeutic targets and we are actively focused on developing novel small molecule, antibody, or other therapeutic drug candidates to treat the disease, and advance these drug candidates towards an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing and potential future clinical trials. We may also form partnerships around the development of targets or therapeutics for the treatment of IBD.
We expect to broaden our work into additional therapeutic areas over time and are currently exploring specific tissues for development. In our work to identify the areas of interest, we evaluate areas that might be better served with 3D disease models than currently available models as well as the commercial opportunity.
We hold a large and diverse patent portfolio related to our bioprinting platform and complementary 3D technologies. The strength of this patent portfolio, the fact that it was created early in the bioprinting revolution and growth in the bioprinting industry have made for an attractive business opportunity for us. We are now beginning to invest resources to explore and expand business and revenue opportunities from the leveraging of our patent portfolio.
COVID-19
Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the rise of vaccine-resistant variants, the duration of the outbreak, and any
travel bans, restrictions or other limitations that may be imposed in the future . In particular, the continued COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact various aspects of our operations, including among others, our ability to raise additional capital, the timing and ability to pursue our revised strategy, given the impact the pandemic may have on the manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations of potential strategic partners and the ability to advance our research and development activities and pursue development of our pipeline products each of which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. Our employees and consultants have returned to working at our office and lab when necessary. We have developed guidelines and protocols to handle exposures and infections intended to keep disruptions to operations to a minimum.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition and the valuation of stock-based compensation expense. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since March 31, 2022. For a description of critical accounting policies that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 10, 2022.

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.3 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease year over year relates to a decrease in legal expenses, resulting from settling litigation that occurred in fiscal 2022. Our average full-time general and administrative staff increased from an average of four full-time employees for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to an average of five full-time employees for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our fiscal 2023 operations resulted in a $0.1 million increase in personnel related costs and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, which was offset by a $0.5 million decrease in legal and general corporate costs.
Other Income
Other income was less than $0.1 million for both of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $6.7 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or approximately 9%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease year over year mostly relates to a decrease in legal expenses, resulting from settling litigation that occurred in fiscal 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we had an average of four full-time employees, compared to an average of five full-time employees for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Our fiscal 2023 operations resulted in a $0.6 million increase in personnel related costs, a $0.1 million increase in depreciation, amortization and other miscellaneous expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in consulting costs, which was offset by a $1.6 million decrease in legal and general corporate costs.
Other Income
Other income was $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Going forward, we intend to leverage our proprietary technology platform to develop therapeutic drugs. Our initial plan is to focus on IBD, including CD and UC with a goal of broadening our work into additional therapeutic areas over time. In connection with our strategy, we intend to continue to expand our research and development functions to support our screening and drug development efforts.
At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20.2 million, restricted cash of approximately $0.1 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $317.5 million. The restricted cash was pledged as collateral for a letter of credit that the Company is required to maintain as a security deposit under the terms of the lease agreement for its facilities. We had negative cash flow from operations of approximately $7.7 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $28.7 million, restricted cash of approximately $0.1 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $307.7 million.
At December 31, 2022, we had total current assets of approximately $21.6 million and current liabilities of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in working capital of $20.2 million. At March 31, 2022, we had total current assets of approximately $29.5 million and current liabilities of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in working capital of $28.1 million.

Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $7.7 million as compared to $6.9 million used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This $0.8 million increase in operating cash usage can be attributed primarily to the increase in research and development activities.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Investing activities consisted of the purchases of equity securities of $1.1 million, the sales of equity securities of $0.4 million, the purchases of short-term investments of $9.9 million, the maturities of investments of $10.0 million, and fixed asset purchases of $0.2 million. Net cash used by investing activities, consisting of fixed asset purchases, was $0.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Financing activities
There were no cash financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of the sale of common stock through at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings, was $0.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Operations funding requirements
Through December 31, 2022, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of convertible notes, warrants, the private placement of equity securities, the sale of common stock through public and ATM offerings, and through revenue derived from products and research service-based agreements, collaborative agreements, licenses, and grants.
Our ongoing cash requirements include research and development expenses, compensation for personnel, consulting fees, legal and accounting support, insurance premiums, facilities, maintenance of our intellectual property portfolio, license and collaboration agreements, listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and other miscellaneous fees to support our operations. We expect our total operating expense for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 will be between $12.0 million and $14.0 million. Based on our current operating plan and available cash resources, we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our business for at least the next twelve months.
We previously had an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222929) (the “2018 Shelf”) that registered $100.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and units, or any combination of the foregoing, that was set to expire on February 22, 2021. On January 19, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252224) to register $150.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, or any combination of the foregoing (the “2021 Shelf”) and a related prospectus. The 2021 Shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2021 and replaced the 2018 Shelf at that time.
On March 16, 2018, we entered into a Sales Agreement (“Sales Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC and Jones Trading Institutional Services LLC (each an “Agent” and together, the “Agents”). On January 29, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement to the 2021 Shelf (the “ATM Prospectus Supplement”), pursuant to which we could offer and sell, from time to time through the Agents, shares of our common stock in ATM sales transactions having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. Any shares offered and sold are issued pursuant to our 2021 Shelf.
23
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we sold no shares of common stock in ATM offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we have sold an aggregate of 1,580,862 shares of common stock in ATM offerings under the ATM Prospectus Supplement, for gross proceeds of approximately $21.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $100.0 million available in future offerings under the 2021 Shelf, and approximately $28.3 million available for future offerings through our ATM program under the ATM Prospectus Supplement.
Having insufficient funds may require us to relinquish rights to our technology on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Failure to obtain adequate financing could eventually adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. We cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if and when needed, or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders. Any failure to obtain financing when required will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 8,714,590 total issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
On October 12, 2022, our stockholders and the Board of Directors ("Board") approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan ("2022 Plan"), and it became effective on that date. The 2022 Plan replaced the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan ("2012 Plan") on the effective date. Upon the effective date, we ceased granting awards under the 2012 Plan and any shares remaining available for future issuance under the 2012 Plan were cancelled and are no longer available for future issuance. The 2012 Plan continues to govern awards previously granted under it. At the time the Board approved the 2022 Plan, an aggregate of 1,363,000 shares of our common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan. We committed to reducing the new 2022 Plan share reserve by the number of shares that were granted under the 2012 Plan and the Inducement Plan between July 25, 2022 and October 12, 2022. From July 25, 2022 to October 12, 2022, we issued 126,262 shares of common stock under the 2012 Plan. As a result, the number of shares reserved for future issuance under the 2022 Plan is 1,236,738 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022. We also committed to reducing the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the 2021 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan ("Inducement Plan") from 750,000 shares to 51,000 shares (which includes 50,000 shares of its common stock issuable pursuant to an outstanding option to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $2.75 per share, leaving only 1,000 shares available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan) and the share reserve was reduced effective October 12, 2022.
The 2022 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,236,738 shares of our common stock, of which 1,115,635 shares remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2022, to executive officers, directors, advisory board members, employees and consultants. The 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 2,327,699 shares of our common stock, of which no shares remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, 75,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), of which 59,435 shares remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2022. Finally, 51,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuances under our Inducement Plan, of which 1,000 remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2022. In aggregate, issued and outstanding common stock and shares issuable under outstanding equity awards or reserved for future issuance under the 2022 Plan, the 2012 Plan, the Inducement Plan, and the ESPP total 11,426,771 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including unrecorded derivative instruments that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We have certain options outstanding but we do not expect to receive sufficient proceeds from the exercise of these instruments unless and until the underlying securities are registered, and/or all restrictions on trading, if any, are removed, and in either case the trading price of our common stock is significantly greater than the applicable exercise prices of the options and warrants.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not required for smaller reporting companies under Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report were designed and operating effectively.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

PROCEEDINGS
See Note 6 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-Q for a discussion of our legal proceedings and contingencies.
ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS
Investment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a result, the purchase of our common stock should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford to lose their entire investment. Before you elect to purchase our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information incorporated herein by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or which we currently believe are immaterial could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties discussed in this Quarterly Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risk factors marked with an asterisk (*) below include a substantive change from or an update to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 10, 2022.
Risk Factor Summary
Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission before making investment decisions regarding our common stock.
• We will incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development activities increase.
• Using our platform technology to develop human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development is new and unproven.
• As we pursue drug development through 3D tissues and disease models, we will require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to support our development activities.
• We may require substantial additional funding. Raising additional capital would cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.
• Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results.
• The near and long-term viability of our drug discovery and development efforts will depend on our ability to successfully establish strategic relationships.
• Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercializing our drug candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain if our drug candidates are approved for commercialization.
• We may be unable to continue as a going concern in the future.
• Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or cease our operations.
• We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.
• There is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future.
• The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.
26
• Patents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.
• We may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.
Risks Related to COVID-19
We face risks related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty. The continued COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our operations, including among others,
the impact it may have on the manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations of potential strategic partners, and the ability to advance our research and development activities and pursue development of any of our pipeline products, each of which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. In particular, we require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to support our development activities. The COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to obtain a reliable supply of sufficient human cells or a supply at cost effective prices, which would harm our business and our results of operations and could cause us to be unable to support our drug development efforts.
In addition, the stock market has been unusually volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic and such volatility may continue. Our stock price has also experienced volatility during this time, including occasional significant increases and decreases. Such increases and decreases in our stock price may repeat or continue for the foreseeable future.
There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any similar health epidemic that may occur in the future, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19’s impact on our business, our operations, or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects may have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.
Risks Related to our Business
We have recommenced our operations as an early-stage company focusing on 3D bioprinting technology to develop human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development, which is an unproven business strategy that may never achieve profitability.
Following the election of the new board of directors at our 2020 Annual Meeting of stockholders, we have recommenced operations and are focusing our efforts on utilizing our 3D bioprinting technology to develop human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development. We have recommenced our operations as an early-stage company with an unproven business strategy, and may never achieve profitability. Our success will depend upon the viability of our platform technology and any disease models we develop, as well as on our ability to determine which drug candidates we should pursue. Our success will also depend on our ability to select an appropriate development strategy for any drug candidates we identify, including internal development or partnering or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. We may not be able to partner or license our drug candidates. We may never achieve profitability, or even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability.
We will incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development activities increase.
We will incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development activities increase. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things:
• successfully developing human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development that enable us to identify drug candidates;
• successfully outsourcing certain portions of our development efforts;
• entering into partnering or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to further develop and conduct clinical trials for any drug candidates we identify;
• obtaining any necessary regulatory approval for any drug candidates we identify; and
• raising sufficient funds to finance our activities and long-term business plan.
27
We might not succeed at any of these undertakings. If we are unsuccessful at one or more of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
Using our platform technology to develop human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development is new and unproven.
Utilizing our 3D bioprinting platform technology to develop human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development will involve new and unproven technologies, disease models and approaches, each of which is subject to the risk associated with new and evolving technologies. To date, we have not identified or developed any drug candidates utilizing our new business model. Our future success will depend on our ability to utilize our 3D bioprinting platform to develop human tissues and disease models that will enable us to identify and develop viable drug candidates. We may experience unforeseen technical complications, unrecognized defects and limitations in our technology or our ability to develop disease models or identify viable drug candidates. These complications could materially delay or substantially increase the anticipated costs and time to identify and develop viable drug candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our ability to continue operations.
We will face intense competition in our drug discovery efforts.
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. There are many potential competitors for the disease indications we may pursue, including major drug companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in the following areas than we have, including:
• research and technology development;
• development of or access to disease models;
• identification and development of drug candidates;
• regulatory processes and approvals; and
• identifying and entering into agreements with potential collaborators.
Principal competitive factors in our industry include: the quality, scientific and technical support, management and the execution of drug development and regulatory approval strategies; skill and experience of employees, including the ability to recruit and retain skilled, experienced employees; intellectual property portfolio; range of capabilities, including drug identification, development and regulatory approval; and the availability of substantial capital resources to fund these activities.
In order to effectively compete, we may need to make substantial investments in our research and technology development, drug candidate identification and development, testing and regulatory approval and licensing and business development activities. There is no assurance that we will be successful in discovering effective drug candidates using our 3D bioprinted tissues or disease models. Our technologies and drug development plans also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of drugs, intellectual property, technologies, products and services introduced by competitors. Any of these risks may prevent us from building a successful drug discovery business or entering into a strategic partnership or collaboration related to, any drug candidates we identify on favorable terms, or at all.
As we pursue drug development through 3D tissues and disease models, we will require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to support our development activities.
As we pursue drug development through 3D tissues and disease models, we will require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to support our 3D tissue development activities. We purchase human cells from selected third-party suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and regulatory requirements. We need to continue to identify additional sources of qualified human cells and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity and quality of raw materials needed at a cost-effective price. Any failure to obtain a reliable supply of sufficient human cells or a supply at cost effective prices, including any impact to suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would harm our business and our results of operations and could cause us to be unable to support our drug development efforts.
28
Our business will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully attract, hire and integrate key additional employees or contractors.
Our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully attract and then retain key additional executive officers and other key employees and contractors to support our drug discovery plans. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel is critical to our success. Competition to hire qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our drug discovery business will be limited, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We may require substantial additional funding. Raising additional capital would cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.
We currently do not have any committed external source of funds and do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue in the foreseeable future. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and interest thereon is expected to be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect if our operating plans change. If our board of directors decides that we should pursue further research and development activities than already proposed, we will require substantial additional funding to operate our proposed business, including expanding our facilities and hiring additional qualified personnel, and we would expect to finance these cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and licensing or collaboration arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any equity or convertible debt we agree to issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Convertible debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Moreover, we have the ability to sell up to $28.3 million of additional shares of our common stock to the public through an “at the market” offering pursuant to an ATM Prospectus Supplement filed on January 29, 2021, as well as a Sales Agreement that we entered into with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC and Jones Trading Institutional Services LLC on March 16, 2018. Any shares of common stock issued in the at-the-market offering will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
Further, additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or cease our operations. Raising additional funding through debt or equity financing is likely to be difficult or unavailable altogether given the early stage of our technology and any drug candidates we identify. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings.
Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results.
Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any drug candidates we identify, any such drug candidates must undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates in humans. Human clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and we cannot be certain that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We may elect to complete this testing, or some portion thereof, internally or enter into a partnering or development agreement with a pharmaceutical company to complete these trials. Our inability, or the inability of any third party with whom we enter into a partnering or development agreement, to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us and negatively impact our ability to generate revenues or receive development or milestone payments. Our future success is dependent on our ability, or the ability of any pharmaceutical company with whom we enter into a partnering or development agreement, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize any drug candidates we identify.
Any drug candidates we identify will require additional clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in applicable jurisdictions, achieving and maintaining commercial-scale supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our drug candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates.
29
We, or any third party with whom we enter into a partnering or development agreement, may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to earn development or milestone payments or for any drug candidates to obtain regulatory approval, including:
• delays in or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (“CROs”) and clinical sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;
• failure to obtain sufficient enrollment in clinical trials or participants may fail to complete clinical trials;
• clinical trials of our drug candidates that may produce negative or inconclusive results, and as a result we, or any pharmaceutical company with who we enter into a partnering or development agreement, may decide, or regulators may require, additional clinical trials;
• suspension or termination of clinical research, either by us, any third party with whom we enter into a partnering or development agreement, regulators or institutional review boards, for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;
• additional or unanticipated clinical trials required by regulators or institutional review boards to obtain approval or any drug candidates may be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval;
• regulators may revise the requirements for approving any drug candidates, or such requirements may not be as anticipated;
• the cost of clinical trials for any drug candidates may be greater than anticipated;
• the supply or quality of any drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate or may be delayed;
• regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution; and
• delays due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to the receipt of drug candidates or other materials, submission of New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), filing of Investigational New Drug (“INDs”), and starting any clinical trials for other indications or programs.
If we, or any third party with whom we enter into a partnering or development agreement, experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of any drug candidates that we develop, or are unable to achieve clinical endpoints due to unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates will be harmed, and our ability to develop milestones, development fees or product revenues from any of these drug candidates will be delayed.
We will rely upon third-party contractors and service providers for the execution of critical aspects of any future development programs. Failure of these collaborators to provide services of a suitable quality and within acceptable timeframes may cause the delay or failure of any future development programs.
We plan to outsource certain functions, tests and services to CROs, medical institutions and collaborators as well as outsource manufacturing to collaborators and/or contract manufacturers, and we will rely on third parties for quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise. We may elect, in the future, to engage a CRO to run all aspects of a clinical trial on our behalf. There is no assurance that such individuals or organizations will be able to provide the functions, tests, biologic supply or services as agreed upon or in a quality fashion and we could suffer significant delays in the development of our drug candidates or development programs.
In some cases, there may be only one or few providers of such services, including clinical data management or manufacturing services. In addition, the cost of such services could be significantly increased over time. We may rely on third parties and collaborators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties and collaborators for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Our reliance on these parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the regulatory agency applications. In addition, these third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not manufacture under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions. Preclinical or clinical studies may not be performed or completed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulatory requirements or our trial design. If these third parties or collaborators do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, obtaining regulatory approval for manufacturing and commercialization of our drug candidates may be delayed or prevented. We may rely substantially on third-party data managers for our clinical trial data. There is no assurance that these third parties will not make errors in the design, management or retention of our data or data systems. There is no assurance these third parties will pass FDA or regulatory audits, which could delay or prohibit regulatory approval.
30
In addition, we will exercise limited control over our third-party partners and vendors, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays in their operations. If these third parties experience any service disruptions, financial distress or other business disruption, or difficulties meeting our requirements or standards, it could make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business.
The near and long-term viability of our drug discovery and development efforts will depend on our ability to successfully establish strategic relationships.
The near and long-term viability of our drug discovery and development efforts depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic partnering, collaboration and licensing arrangements with biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, universities, hospitals, insurance companies and or government agencies. Establishing strategic relationships is difficult and time-consuming. Potential partners and collaborators may not enter into relationships with us based upon their assessment of our technology or drug candidates or our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of strategic relationships on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts. Even if we establish new strategic relationships, these relationships may never result in the successful development or regulatory approval for any drug candidates we identify for a number of reasons both within and outside of our control.
Investors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
There is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees, regulators and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors. Some investors and investor advocacy groups may use these factors to guide investment strategies and, in some cases, investors may choose not to invest in
our company if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance, and a variety of organizations currently measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. Investors, particularly institutional investors, use these ratings to benchmark companies against their peers and if we are perceived as lagging with respect to ESG initiatives, certain investors may engage with us to improve ESG disclosures or performance and may also make voting decisions, or take other actions, to hold us and our board of directors accountable. In addition, the criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies.
We may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility initiatives or objectives do not meet the standards set by our investors, stockholders, lawmakers, listing exchanges or other constituencies, or if we are unable to achieve an acceptable ESG or sustainability rating from third-party rating services. A low ESG or sustainability rating by a third-party rating service could also result in the exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead. Ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other parties as described above may impose additional costs or expose us to new risks. Any failure or perceived failure by us in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, share price, financial condition, or results of operations, including the sustainability of our business over time.
The impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy, energy supplies and raw materials is uncertain, but may prove to negatively impact our business and operations.
The short and long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. We continue to monitor any adverse impact that the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent institution of sanctions against Russia by the United States and several European and Asian countries may have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our suppliers and customers. For example, a prolonged conflict may result in increased inflation, escalating energy prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs of raw materials. To the extent the war in Ukraine may adversely affect our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our product prices; disruptions in global supply chains; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial performance and financial condition.
31
Risks Related to Government Regulation
In the past, we have used hazardous chemicals, biological materials and infectious agents in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.
Our product manufacturing, research and development, and testing activities have involved the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious disease agents. We cannot eliminate the risks of accidental contamination or the accidental spread or discharge of these materials, or any resulting injury from such an event. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. We were also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, and the experimental use of animals. Our operations may have required that environmental permits and approvals be issued by applicable government agencies. If we failed to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance.
If we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for our potential products by third-party payors, potential future sales would be materially adversely affected.
There will be no viable commercial market for our drug candidates, if approved, without reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement policies may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for our current drug candidates or any other drug candidate we may develop. Additionally, even if there is a viable commercial market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our anticipated revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.
Third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the Company, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. There is a current trend in the U.S. healthcare industry toward cost containment.
Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. We believe our drugs will be priced significantly higher than existing generic drugs and consistent with current branded drugs. If we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing generic drugs, Medicare, Medicaid and private payors may not be willing to provide reimbursement for our drugs, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of our products gaining market acceptance.
We expect that private insurers will consider the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, safety and tolerability of our potential products in determining whether to approve reimbursement for such products and at what level. Obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of our potential products from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to Medicare patients as discussed below, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if Part D prescription drug plans were to limit access to, or deny or limit reimbursement of, our drug candidates or other potential products.
Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many countries, the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.

If the prices for our potential products are reduced or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement of our drugs, our future revenue, cash flows and prospects for profitability will suffer.
Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercializing our drug candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain if our drug candidates are approved for commercialization.
In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of adopted and proposed legislative and regulatory changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-marketing activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any of our drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval.
In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could limit the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the “PPACA”), was enacted. The PPACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The PPACA increased manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate amount for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of “average manufacturer price”, which may also increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also expanded Medicaid drug rebates and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the rebates due on those drugs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, also has proposed to expand Medicaid rebates to the utilization that occurs in the territories of the U.S., such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Further, beginning in 2011, the PPACA imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and required manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” Legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced at both the state and federal level to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.
There have been public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress, regarding plans to repeal and replace the PPACA and Medicare. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which, among other things, eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court’s ruling with respect to the individual mandate but remanded the case to the District Court to consider whether other parts of the law can remain in effect. While the Texas District Court Judge has stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the law and our business.
We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.
33
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government payor programs, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has started soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates, if approved for commercialization.
In Europe, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020, and entered into a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. A significant portion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from the regulations of the European Union. We cannot predict what consequences the recent withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have on the regulatory frameworks of the United Kingdom or the European Union, or on our future operations, if any, in these jurisdictions, and the United Kingdom is in the process of negotiating trade deals with other countries. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may increase the possibility that other countries may decide to leave the European Union again.
Risks Related to Our Capital Requirements, Finances and Operations
We may be unable to continue as a going concern in the future.
We have had recurring losses from operations since inception and will likely not generate meaningful revenue for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements under our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. However, if our operating plans change and our projected operating requirements increase, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. In this event, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may have an adverse impact on our business due to concerns about our ability to meet our future contractual obligations or pursue additional strategic transactions. Further, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation and dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements and an investor could lose all or part of its investment in our equity.
Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or cease our operations.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. Raising additional funding through debt or equity financing is likely to be difficult or unavailable altogether given the early stage of our therapeutic candidates. If such additional financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, we may be required to delay, limit or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. In addition, if we seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to our technology or potential future product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.
*We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.
We have generated operating losses each year since we began operations, including $10.0 million and $9.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $317.5 million. We expect to incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development activities increase.
34
The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things:
• successfully developing human tissues and disease models for drug discovery and development that enable us to identify drug candidates;
• successfully outsourcing certain portions of our development efforts;
• entering into collaboration or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to further develop and conduct clinical trials for any drug candidates we identify;
• obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals for any drug candidates we identify; and
• raising sufficient funds to finance our activities and long-term business plan.
We might not succeed at any of these undertakings. If we are unsuccessful at one or more of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. We may never generate significant revenue, and even if we do generate significant revenue, we may never achieve profitability.
Our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
Our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as expenses related to:
• evaluating and implementing strategic alternatives, technology licensing opportunities, potential collaborations, and other strategic transactions;
• litigation;
• research and development expenditures, including commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials;
• the timing of the hiring of new employees, which may require payments of signing, retention or similar bonuses; and
• changes in costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic or the general global economy.
We believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
We may identify material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements.
Our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We cannot assure you that we will not have material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, and our stock price may decline materially as a result.
Future strategic investments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to achieve the desired returns on our investment.
Our ability to benefit from future external strategic investments depends on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, evaluate prospective opportunities, and buy the equity of our target investments at acceptable market prices. Our failure in any of these tasks could result in unforeseen losses associated with the strategic investments.
We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, product liabilities or other undisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our investment, which could result in us becoming subject
35
asset impairments, including potential loss of our investment capital. In addition, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an external investment as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may downgrade our stock.
We also expect to continue to carry out strategic investments that we believe are necessary to expand our business.
There are no assurances that such initiatives will yield favorable results for us. Accordingly, if these initiatives are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected. Any difficulties in such investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to retain our executive officers and other key personnel.
Our future success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, especially our executive officers. We do not currently have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers or our other key personnel, and there is no guarantee that our executive officers or key personnel will remain employed with us. Moreover, we have not obtained key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death, disability or incapacity of any of our executive officers or other key personnel. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for any executive officers and other key personnel we lose in the future would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. Additionally, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. Finally, certain of our executives also provide services to Viscient Biosciences, Inc. (“Viscient”). Executives that provide services to us and Viscient do not dedicate all of their time to us, as disclosed in our filings, and we may therefore compete with Viscient for the time commitments of our executive officers from time to time.
We may be subject to security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents that could compromise our information and expose us to liability.
We routinely collect and store sensitive data (such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information) for ourselves, our employees and our suppliers and customers. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer systems and networks and to protect this information. However, like other companies in our industry, our networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, foreign companies or competitors, or may be breached by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption. Any such breach could result in unauthorized access to (or disclosure of) sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours, our employees or our suppliers or customers, and/or loss or damage to our data. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of information could cause competitive harm, result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and/or cause reputational harm.
We may experience conflicts of interest with Viscient Biosciences, Inc. with respect to business opportunities and other matters.
Keith Murphy, our Executive Chairman, is the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and principal stockholder of Viscient, a private company that he founded in 2017 that is focused on drug discovery and development utilizing 3D tissue technology and multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics). Jeffrey N. Miner, our Chief Scientific Officer, is a co-founder, the Chief Scientific Officer and a significant stockholder of Viscient. In addition, Adam Stern, Douglas Jay Cohen and David Gobel (through the Methuselah Foundation and the Methuselah Fund), members of our Board, have invested funds through a convertible promissory note in Viscient, but do not serve as an employee, officer or director of Viscient. Additional members of our Research and Development organization also work at Viscient, and we expect that additional employees or consultants of ours will also be employees of or consultants to Viscient. We use certain Viscient-owned facilities and equipment and allow Viscient to use certain of our facilities and equipment. During fiscal 2022 and 2023, we provided services to Viscient, and Viscient has previously purchased primary human cell-based products from our former subsidiary, Samsara Sciences, Inc. We expect to continue to provide services to Viscient and enter into additional agreements with Viscient in the future.
In addition, we license, as well as cross-license, certain intellectual property to and from Viscient and expect to continue to do so in the future. In particular, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement with Viscient, dated November 6, 2019, as amended, we have provided a paid up, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive license to Viscient under certain of our patents and know-how to (a) make, have made, use, sell offer to sell, import and otherwise exploit the inventions and subject matter covered by certain patents regarding certain bioprinter devices and bioprinting methods, engineered liver tissues, engineered renal tissues, engineered intestinal tissue and engineered tissue for in vitro research use, (b) to use and internally repair the bioprinters, and (c) to make additional bioprinters for internal use only in connection with drug discovery and development research, target identification and validation, compound screening, preclinical safety, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) studies, and in vitro research to complement clinical development of a therapeutic compound. Although we have entered, and expect to enter, into agreements and arrangements that we believe appropriately govern the ownership of intellectual property created by joint employees or consultants of Viscient and/or using our or Viscient’s facilities or equipment, it is possible that we may
36
disagree with Viscient as to the ownership of intellectual property created by shared employees or consultants, or using shared equipment or facilities.
On December 28, 2020, we entered into an intercompany agreement with Viscient and Organovo, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Intercompany Agreement”). Pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement, we agreed to provide Viscient certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, which includes, but is not limited to, histology services, cell isolation, and proliferation of cells, and Viscient agreed to provide us certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, including bioprinter training, bioprinting services, and qPCR assays, in each case on payment terms specified in the Intercompany Agreement and as may be further determined by the parties. In addition, Viscient and we each agreed to share certain facilities and equipment and, subject to further agreement, to each make certain employees available for specified projects to the other party at prices to be determined in good faith by the parties. Under the Intercompany Agreement, each party will retain its own prior intellectual property and will obtain new intellectual property rights within their respectively defined fields of use.
Due to the interrelated nature of Viscient with us, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Viscient, potential acquisitions of businesses or products, the development and ownership of technologies and products, the sale of products, markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of Viscient. In addition, we and Viscient may disagree regarding the interpretation of certain terms of the arrangements we previously entered into with Viscient or may enter into in the future. We cannot guarantee that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor, or that, with respect to our transactions with Viscient, we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with another third-party. In addition, executives that provide services to us and Viscient may not dedicate all of their time to us and we may therefore compete with Viscient for the time commitments of our executive officers from time to time.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Liquidity Risks
We could fail to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction.
The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) has established continued listing requirements, including a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1 per share. If a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below such minimum closing bid price, it will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. Assuming it is in compliance with the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq would provide such company a period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price at least $1 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or other listing requirements necessary for us to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
A delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market and commencement of trading on the OTCBB would likely result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on stockholders:
• the liquidity of our common stock;
• the market price of our common stock (and the accompanying valuation of our Company);
• our ability to obtain financing or complete a strategic transaction;
• the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;
• the number of market markers or broker-dealers for our common stock; and
• the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock.
There is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future.
Our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, but there is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of our common stock on the timeline and at the volumes they desire. This factor limits the liquidity of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to raise additional capital.
37
The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.
The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:
• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
• continued macroeconomic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
• our ability to execute on our new strategic plan;
• reduced government funding for research and development activities;
• actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;
• adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;
• additions or departures of key personnel;
• sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;
• degree of coverage of securities analysts and reports and recommendations issued by securities analysts regarding our business;
• volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock; and
• other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.
The stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.
*Investors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock.
We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were an aggregate of 11,426,771 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and available for issuance on a fully diluted basis and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. That total for our common stock includes 2,652,746 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the vesting of restricted stock units, the exercise of outstanding stock options, or is available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, and 59,435 shares of common stock that may be issued through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
In the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities to raise funds to support our continued operations and to implement our business plan. We may also issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, or for other business purposes. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders may result. In addition, the future issuance of any such additional shares of capital stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Moreover, depending on market conditions, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We have paid no dividends on our common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of our business, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. As an investor, you should take note of the fact that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment.
38
Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
Our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (“Certificate of Incorporation”), and Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”) contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:
• authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;
• provide for a classified board of directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;
• provide that each director may be removed by the stockholders only for cause;
• prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent; and
• require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.
In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
*Our Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state or federal court located in the State of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.
Our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state or federal court located in the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholder; (iii) any direct action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers pursuant to any of the provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws; (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. However, our Bylaws do not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. Our Bylaws also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this choice of forum provision.
This choice of forum provision in our Bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
If we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.
Our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our technologies, intellectual property and products and service offerings in the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and gain a competitive advantage.
39
To protect our products and technologies, we, and our collaborators and licensors, must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and pursue other intellectual property protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Moreover, the patent positions of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, we cannot guarantee that:
• any patent applications filed by us will issue as patents;
• third parties will not challenge our proprietary rights, and if challenged that a court or an administrative board of a patent office will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable;
• third parties will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims;
• any patents issued to us will cover our technology and products as ultimately developed;
• we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;
• the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business; or
• as issued patents expire, we will not lose some competitive advantage.
As previously disclosed, we have recommenced certain historical operations and are now focusing our future efforts on developing highly customized 3D human tissues as living, dynamic models for healthy and diseased human biology for drug development. Previously, we focused our efforts on developing our in vivo liver tissues to treat end-stage liver disease and a select group of life-threatening, orphan diseases, for which there were limited treatment options other than organ transplant. We also explored the development of other potential pipeline in vivo tissue constructs. As we focus our business on developing highly customized 3D human tissues, we may sell, discontinue, adjust or abandon certain patents and patent applications relating to our historical operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful at such efforts or sell or otherwise monetize such assets on acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no guarantee that our remaining patents will be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
Certain foreign jurisdictions have an absolute requirement of novelty that renders any public disclosure of an invention immediately fatal to patentability in such jurisdictions. Therefore, there is a risk that we may not be able to protect some of our intellectual property in the United States or abroad due to disclosures, which we may not be aware of, by our collaborators or licensors. Some foreign jurisdictions prohibit certain types of patent claims, such as “method-of-treatment/use-type” claims; thus, the scope of protection available to us in such jurisdictions is limited.
Moreover, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our potential products and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not sought or obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.
Patents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.
40
The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and
inter partes
review (“IPR”), or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge our priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology or products. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
For example, our U.S. Patent Nos. 9,855,369 and 9,149,952, which relate to our bioprinter technology, were the subject of IPR proceedings filed by Cellink AB and its subsidiaries, MatTek Incorporated and Visikol, Inc. (collectively, “BICO Group AB”), one of our competitors. Likewise, U.S. Patent Nos. 9,149,952, 9,855,369, 8,931,880, 9,227,339, 9,315,043 and 10,967,560 (all assigned to Organovo, Inc.) and U.S. Patent Nos. 7,051,654, 8,241,905, 8,852,932 and 9,752,116 (assigned to Clemson University and the University of Missouri, respectively) were implicated in a declaratory judgment complaint filed against Organovo, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, by BICO Group AB and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. All of these matters were eventually settled in February 2022.
Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our inventions, patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.
In addition, if we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our products, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation, including through re-examination, post-grant review,
IPR, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.
Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors or our licensors may breach or otherwise prematurely terminate the provisions of our license agreements with them. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims or lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our collaborators or licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our other patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, our licensors may continue to retain certain rights to use technologies licensed by us for research purposes. Patent disputes can take years to resolve, can be very costly and can result in loss of rights, injunctions or substantial penalties. Moreover, patent disputes and related proceedings can distract management’s attention and interfere with running our business.
41
Furthermore, because of the potential for substantial discovery in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments which could harm our business.
As more companies file patents relating to bioprinters and bioprinted tissues, it is possible that patent claims relating to bioprinters or bioprinted human tissue may be asserted against us. In addition, the drug candidates we pursue may also be pursued by other companies, and it is possible that patent claims relating to such drug candidates may also be asserted against us. Any patent claims asserted against us could harm our business. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities, which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product shipment or delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, infringement and other intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and divert management’s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.
Our current and future research, development and commercialization activities also must satisfy the obligations under our license agreements. Any disputes arising under our license agreements could be costly and distract our management from the conduct of our business. Moreover, premature termination of a license agreement could have an adverse impact on our business.
In addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) to determine the priority of invention and opposition proceedings outside of the United States. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party.
Third parties may also attempt to initiate reexamination, post grant review or inter partes review of our patents or those of our collaborators or licensors in the PTO. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology.
We depend on license agreements with University of Missouri and Clemson University for rights to use certain patents, pending applications, and know how. Failure to comply with or maintain obligations under these agreements and any related or other termination of these agreements could materially harm our business and prevent us from developing or commercializing new product candidates.
We are party to license agreements with University of Missouri and Clemson University under which we were granted exclusive rights to patents and patent applications that are important to our business and to our ability to develop and commercialize our NovoGen Bioprinters and 3D tissue products fabricated using our NovoGen Bioprinters. Our rights to use these patents and patent applications and employ the inventions claimed in these licensed patents are subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of our license agreements. If we were to breach the terms of these license agreements and the agreements were terminated as a result, our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our NovoGen Bioprinters and 3D tissue products and to operate our business could be adversely impacted.
We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
In order to protect our proprietary and licensed technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.
42
We employ or engage individuals who were previously employed at other biopharmaceutical companies. Although we have no knowledge of any such claims against us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees’ former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. To date, none of our employees have been subject to such claims.
General Risk Factors
Compliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.
We are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). The costs of complying with the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial.
If we fail to comply with the rules of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act related to accounting controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities and our stock price could decline.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We believe our system and process evaluation and testing comply with the management certification requirements of Section 404. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be able to satisfy the requirements in Section 404 in all future periods. If we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors’ confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be required to incur significant additional financial and management resources to achieve compliance.
