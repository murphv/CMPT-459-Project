Organization and Basis of Presentation            Escalon Medical Corp. ("Escalon" or "Company") is a Pennsylvania corporation initially incorporated in California in 1987, and reincorporated in Pennsylvania in November 2001. Within this document, the “Company” collectively shall mean Escalon, which includes its division called "Trek" and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Sonomed, Inc. (“Sonomed”), Escalon Digital Solutions, Inc. (“EMI”), and Sonomed IP Holdings, Inc.
The Company operates in the healthcare market, specializing in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals in the area of ophthalmology. The Company and its products are subject to regulation and inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FDA and other government authorities require extensive testing of new products prior to sale and has jurisdiction over the safety, efficacy and manufacture of products, as well as product labeling and marketing.     The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information required herein. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Statements of America ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. While management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Security and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The results of operations fo r the three and
six months e nded December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year.
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As military activity proceeds and sanctions, export controls and other measures are imposed by many countries against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine, the war is increasingly affecting the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption. The Company has operations or activities in countries and regions outside the United States. As a result, its global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which the Company has business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, although the Company has not yet assessed that the war has had a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on macroeconomic conditions and continually assess the effect these matters may have on customer demand, suppliers’ ability to deliver products, cybersecurity risks and its liquidity and access to capital.     The Company’s common stock trades on the OTCQB Market under the symbol “ESMC.” 2 . Going Concern The Company’s operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect its operating results and financial condition. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the continuous enhancement of the current products, development of new products; changes in domestic and foreign regulations; ability of manufacture successfully; competition from products manufactured and sold or being developed by other companies; the price of, and demand for, the Company’s products and its ability to raise capital to support its operations. To date, the Company’s operations have not generated sufficient revenues to enable profitability. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 69.2
million, and incurred
recurring losses from operations and incurred negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 7 The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent on its future profitability and on the on-going support of its shareholders, affiliates and creditors. In order to mitigate the going concern issues, the Company is actively pursuing business partnerships, managing its continuing operations, implementing cost-cutting measures and seeking to sell certain assets. The Company may not be successful in any of these efforts. 3.
Summary of
Accounting Policies
Quarterly Reporting The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and have been consistently applied. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, but which are not required for interim reporting purposes, have been omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position as of December 31, 2022 and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2022. Operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending June 30, 2023. Principles of Consolidation The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral for accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses based on the Company’s historical trends, specific customer
issues and current economic trends. Accounts are written off against the allowance when they are determined to be uncollectible based on management’s assessment of individual accounts. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $ 256,000
and $ 236,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively . Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and include freight-in materials, labor and overhead costs.
Inventories are written down if the estimated net realizable value is less than the recorded value. The Company reviews the carrying cost of inventories by product to determine the adequacy of reserves for obsolescence. In accounting for inventories, the Company must make estimates regarding the estimated realizable value of inventory. The estimate is based, in part, on the Company’s forecasts of future sales and age of inventory. If actual conditions are less favorable than those the Company has projected, the Company may need to increase its reserves for excess and obsolete inventories. Any increases in the reserves will adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. The establishment of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory establishes a new cost basis in the inventory. Such reserves are not reduced until the product is sold. If the Company is able to sell such inventory any related reserves would be reversed in the period of sale. In accordance with industry practice, service parts inventory is included in current assets, although service parts are carried for established requirements during the serviceable lives of the products and, therefore, not all parts are expected to be sold within one year. PPP Loans
8      The Company's policy is to account for the PPP loan
(See Note 7)
as debt. The Company will continue to record the loan as debt until either (1) the loan is partially or entirely forgiven and the Company has been legally released ,
at which point the amount forgiven will be recorded as income or (2) the Company pays off the loan.
The full amount of the PPP loan and accrued interest were forgiven on August 13, 2021 and was included in other income in the unaudited condensed consolidated income statement for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021. Deferred Revenues
The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of its performance. The Company’s deferred revenues relate to payments received for the customer care plans for a 12-month period. The consideration received is recognized monthly over the service period.

Earnings (loss) Per Share
Earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. All outstanding stock options are considered potential common stock. All outstanding convertible preferred stock are considered common stock at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance, if later, pursuant to the if-converted method. The dilutive effect, if any, of stock options is calculated using the treasury stock method. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the average market prices for the three-month and six-month periods then ended are less than the exercise price of all the outstanding stock options and, therefore, the inclusion of the stock options would be anti-dilutive. In addition, since the effect of common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive with respect to losses, the convertible preferred stock has also been excluded from the Company’s computation of loss per common for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 and six-month period ended December 31, 2022. Therefore, basic and diluted loss per common share for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 are the same.

Under this method, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company has a fully recorded valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.     The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.     The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, no accrued interest or penalties were required to be included on the related tax liability line in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 4.

Related Party Transactions and Preferred Stock 11     On February 14, 2018, the Company entered into a Debt Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Richard DePiano, Sr., (Mr. DePiano Sr.), the Company's
former Chairman and DP Associates Inc. Profit-Sharing Plan of which Mr. DePiano Sr. is the sole owner and sole trustee (the “Holders”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, effective February 15, 2018, the Holders exchanged a total of $ 645,000
principal amount of debt related to the accounts receivable factoring program the Company owes the Holders for
2,000,000
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”).          Each share of Preferred Stock entitles the Holder thereof to 13 votes per share and will vote together with all other classes and series of stock of the Company as a single class on all actions to be taken by the Company’s stockholders.  As a result of this voting power, the Holders as December 31, 2022 beneficially own approximately
77.81 % of the voting power on all actions to be taken by the Company’s shareholders.     Subject to the terms and conditions of Preferred Stock, the holder of any share or shares of the Preferred Stock has the right, at its option at any time, to convert each such share of Preferred Stock (except that, upon any liquidation of the Company, the right of conversion will terminate at the close of business on the business day fixed for payment of the amounts distributable on the Preferred Stock) into
2.15
shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Ratio”).  The Conversion Ratio is subject to standard provisions for adjustment in the event of a subdivision or combination of the Company’s Common Stock and upon any reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company. If the Holders were to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock at the Conversion Ratio the Holders would receive a total of
4,300,000
shares of Common Stock, or approximately
36.70 % of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock assuming such conversion.
Each outstanding share of the Preferred Stock accrues dividends calculated cumulatively at the annual rate of $ .0258
per share (such amount subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reclassification other similar event), payable upon the earlier of (i) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or (ii) conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. Upon either of such events, all such accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or declared, to and until the date of such event, will become immediately due and payable and will be paid in full. The dividends payable to the holders of the Preferred Stock is payable in cash or, at the election of any such holder,
in a number of additional shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of the dividend expressed in dollars divided by the then applicable Conversion Ratio, described above. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 the cumulative dividends payable is $ 251,743
($ 0.1259
per share) a nd $ 225,731
($ 0.1129
per share), respectively.
Mr. DePiano Sr. passed away on October 3, 2019 and left a will by which he appointed Richard J. DePiano, Jr., the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as executor. Richard DePiano Jr. was elected to serve as chairman of the Company's board. Mr. DePiano, Jr. qualified as executor and has control over the listed shares in his capacity as executor of Mr. DePiano Sr.'s estate. 6. Line of Credit      On June 29, 2018 the Company entered a business loan agreement with TD bank receiving a line of credit evidenced by a promissory note of $ 250,000 .
The interest is subject to change based on changes in an independent index which the Wall Street Journal Prime. The index rate at the date of the agreement is
5.0 % per annum. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the note is calculated using a rate of
0.74
percentage points over the index, adjusted if necessary for any minimum and maximum rate limitations, resulting in an initial rate of
5.74 % per annum based on a year of 360 days. The interest rate was
8.24 % as of December 31, 2022. The Company was required to put $ 250,000
in the TD bank savings account as collateral. The Loan is guaranteed by Mr. DePiano Jr.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the line of credit balance was $ 201,575
with TD bank. The line of credit interest expense was approximately $ 4,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The line of credit interest expense was approximately $ 7,000
and
$ 5,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
7. Long-term debt Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loan     On April 27, 2020, the Company entered into a PPP loan for $ 500,000
in connection with the CARES Act related to COVID-19.
The full amount of the PPP loan and accrued interest were forgiven on August 13, 2021 a nd was included in other income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 . 12 Economic Injury Disaster Loan ("EIDL")     EIDL is designed to provide economic relief to businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. EIDL proceeds can be used to cover a wide array of working capital and normal operating expenses, such as continuation to health care benefits, rent, utilities, and fixed debt payments. The Company received a $ 150,000
EIDL loan. The annual interest rate is
3.75 %. The payment term is 30 years and the monthly payment of $ 731
started on July 1st, 2021. The EIDL loan is secured by the tangible and intangible personal property of the Company.
The future annual principal amounts to be paid as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: Year ending June 30, EIDL Payment 2023 (remainder of FY 2023) $ 2,631   2024 3,237   2025 3,376   2026 3,497   Thereafter 139,416   Total $ 152,157   Other short-term Liabilities     The CARES Act allows employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer share of Social Security tax that
would otherwise be due on or after March 27, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. The Company had deferred approximately $ 82,000
of the social security tax. 50% of the deferred employment taxes was paid before December 31, 2021. The remaining
$ 41,000
was paid before
December 31, 2022.
8. Concentration of Credit Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivables. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the United States and international. The Company routinely address the financial strength of its customer and, as a consequence, believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The Company does not require customers to post collateral.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements     Certain statements contained in, or incorporated by reference in, this report are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “possible,” “project,” “should,” “will,” and similar words or expressions. The Company's forward-looking statements include certain information relating to general business strategy, growth strategies, financial results, liquidity, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, discontinued operations, research and development, product development, the introduction of new products, the potential markets and uses for the Company's products, the Company's ability to increase its sales campaign effectively, the Company's regulatory filings with the FDA, acquisitions, dispositions, the development of joint venture opportunities, intellectual property and patent protection and infringement, the loss of revenue due to the expiration or termination of certain agreements, the effect of competition on the structure of the markets in which the Company competes, increased legal, accounting and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, information security, cybersecurity and data privacy risks, defending the Company in litigation matters and the Company's cost saving initiatives. The reader must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by assumptions that fail to materialize as anticipated, including risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, the ability to continue as a going concern including the ability to raise capital, manage operations
and pursue business partnerships and cost-cutting measures, and the other risks described in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors affecting the Company's forward-looking statements, and the reader therefore should not consider the list of such factors contained in its periodic report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 and this Form 10-Q quarterly report to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions. Executive Overview—six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
The following highlights are discussed in further detail within this Form 10-Q. The reader is encouraged to read this Form 10-Q in its entirety to gain a more complete understanding of factors impacting Company performance and financial condition. • Consolidated net revenue increased approximately $234,000 or 4.4%, to $5,610,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The increase in net revenue is attributed to an increase in Sonomed's ultrasound products of $361,000, offset by a decrease in Trek revenue of $40,000, a decrease in service plans revenue of $61,000 and a decrease in sales of AXIS products of $26,000. • Consolidated cost of goods sold totaled approximately $3,301,000, or 58.8%, of total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $3,203,000, or 59.6%, of total revenue of the same period of last fisc al year. The decrease of 0.8% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue is mainly due to changes in product sales mix and geographic differences. • Consolidated marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $316,000, or 17.0%, to $2,170,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The increase in marketing, general and administrate expenses is mainly due to increased network expense, increased consulting expense related to
15 a regulatory filing related to AXIS products, increased trade show and travel expense and the increased sales compensation. • Consolidated research and development expenses decreased $96,000, or 17.4%, to $456,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of last fiscal yea r. Research and development expenses were primarily expenses associated with the introduction of new or enhanced products. The decrease in research and development expense is mainly due to increased consulting expense during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Company Overview     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are set forth in Item 1 of this report.     The Company operates in the healthcare market specializing in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals in the area of ophthalmology. The Company and its products are subject to regulation and inspection by the FDA. The FDA requires extensive testing of new products prior to sale and has jurisdiction over the safety, efficacy and manufacture of products, as well as product labeling and marketing. The Company's Internet address is
www.escalonmed.com . Under the trade name of Sonomed-Escalon the Company develops, manufactures and markets ultrasound systems used for diagnosis or biometric applications in ophthalmology, develops, manufactures and distributes ophthalmic surgical products under the Trek Medical Products name, and
manufactures and markets image management systems. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates are based on management’s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
For a description of the accounting policies that, in management’s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes in our accounting policies and estimates to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 16 Results of Operations Three Months and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022, and 2021

On April 27, 2020, the Company entered into a PPP loan for $500,000 in connection with the CARES Act related to COVID-19. The promissory note has a fixed payment schedule.
The PPP loan is unsecured. A final payment for the unpaid principal and accrued interest will be payable no later than two years after the funding date. The note will bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Company submitted the loan forgiveness application on August 2, 2021. The full amount of the PPP loan and accrued interest of $6,305 were forgiven on August 13, 2021 and reported as other income during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021. Russia-Ukraine War
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As military activity proceeds and sanctions, export controls and other measures are imposed by many countries against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine, the war is increasingly affecting the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption. The Company has operations or activities in countries and regions outside the
18 United States. As a result, its global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which it does business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, although the Company has not yet assessed that the war has had a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our total cash on hand as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $313,000 of cash on hand and restricted cash of approximately $256,000 compared to approximately $594,000 of cash on hand and restricted cash of $256,000 as of June 30, 2022. Approximately $48,000 was available under our line of credit as of December 31, 2022.
Because the Company's operations have not historically generated sufficient revenues to enable profitability, we will continue to monitor costs and expenses closely and may need to raise additional capital or take other actions in order to fund operations.
The Company expects to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through capital raising sources if possible and available, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders, through revenues from the licensing of the Company's products, or through strategic alliances. Additionally, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt sec urities through one or more discrete transactions, or enter into a strategic alliance arrangement, but can provide no assurances that any such financing or strategic alliance arrangement will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. As of December 31, 2022 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $69.2 million, incurred recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and our ability to generate cash to meet our cash requirements for the following twelve months as of the date of this form 10-Q.
The following table presents overall liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2022
and June 30, 2022. Table amounts are in thousands:   December 31, June 30,   2022 2022 Current Ratio: Current assets $3,814 $4,186 Less: Current liabilities 2,962 3,002 Working capital $852 $1,184 Current ratio 1.29 to 1 1.39 to 1 Debt to Total Capital Ratio: Line of credit, note payable, lease liabilities, and EIDL loan $1,053 $1,205 Total debt

$2,204 $2,683 Total debt to total capital
47.8% 44.9% 19 Working Capital Position Working capital decreased approximately $332,000 as of December 31, 2022, and the current ratio decreased to 1.29 to 1 from 1.39 to 1 when compared to June 30, 2022. The decrease in working capital is due to a decrease in current liabilities of $40,000 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and a decrease in current assets of $372,000. Debt to total capital ratio was 47.8% and 44.9% as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase of debt to total capital ratio is due to operating loss.
