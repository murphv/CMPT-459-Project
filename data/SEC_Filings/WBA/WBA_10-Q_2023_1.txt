(UNAUDITED) Note 1.
Accounting policies Basis of presentation The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens Boots Alliance” or the “Company”) included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest and certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included herein are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Walgreens Boots Alliance Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, as amended by Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 filed on November 23, 2022. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ. In the opinion of management, the unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for the interim periods presented include all adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of the results for such interim periods. The impact of opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, COVID-19, the influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payor and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. Certain amounts in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for all periods presented.
Note 2.
Acquisitions and other investments Summit acquisition On January 3, 2023, Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”), through its parent company, following an internal reorganization, completed the acquisition of WP CityMD TopCo (“Summit”), a leading provider of primary, specialty and urgent care in exchange, for $ 7.0  billion aggregate consideration, consisting of $ 4.85  billion of cash consideration paid, $ 2.05  billion in preferred units of VillageMD issued to Summit equity holders and $ 100  million of cash to be paid one year following closing. The cash consideration includes $ 86  million of cash paid to fund acquisition-related bonuses to Summit Health-CityMD employees which is recognized as compensation expense of the Company. In addition, VillageMD paid off approximately $ 1.9  billion in net debt of Summit.

billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the “Transformational Cost Management Program”). The Company achieved this goal at the end of fiscal 2021. On October 12, 2021, the Company expanded and extended the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024 and increased its annual cost savings target to $ 3.3
billion by the end of fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2022, the Company increased its annual cost savings target from $ 3.3
billion to $ 3.5  billion, by the end of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently on track to achieve the savings target.

Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. Based on the analysis completed during fiscal 2022, as of the June 1, 2022 valuation date, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately
7 % to approximately
198 %. The Boots reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately
7 %, compared to
18 % as of June 1, 2021. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the carrying value of goodwill within the Boots reporting unit was $ 940  million and $ 906  million, respectively. The fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit approximate their carrying values. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $ 5.6  billion and $ 5.5
billion, respectively.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions, as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts and economic, industry and market trends, and the impact these may have on the reporting units.

Delayed Draw Term Loan
On December 19, 2022, the Company entered into a $ 1.0  billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “December 2022 DDTL”). Borrowings under the December 2022 DDTL bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, the alternate base rate, the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or the daily SOFR, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is in each case based on the rating of the Company’s corporate debt obligations as determined by Moody’s or S&P. The December 2022 DDTL was drawn for the purpose of funding the consideration due for the purchase of Summit and paying fees and expenses related to it. The December 2022 DDTL matures on January 3, 2026. As of February 28, 2023, there were $ 1.0  billion in borrowings outstanding under the December 2022 DDTL. Amounts borrowed under the December 2022 DDTL and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
June 17, 2022, Revolving Credit Agreements On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a $ 3.5  billion unsecured
five-year
revolving credit facility and a $ 1.5  billion unsecured
18 -month revolving credit facility, with designated borrowers from time to time party thereto and lenders from time to time party thereto (the “2022 Revolving Credit Agreements”). Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facilities accrues at applicable margins based on the Company's Index Debt Rating and ranges from
80
basis points to
150
basis points over specified benchmark rates for eurocurrency rate and SOFR loans, as applicable. Additionally, the Company pays commitment fees to maintain the availability under the revolving credit facility at applicable fee rates based upon certain criteria at an annual rate on the unutilized portion of the total credit commitment. The
five-year
facility’s termination date is June 17, 2027, or earlier, subject to the Company's discretion to terminate the agreement. The
18 -month facility’s termination date is December 15, 2023, or earlier, subject to the Company's discretion to terminate the agreement. As of February 28, 2023, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Credit Agreements. November 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan On November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a $ 5.0
billion senior unsecured multi-tranche delayed draw term loan credit facility, (the “November 2021 DDTL”) consisting of (i) a
364-day
senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.0
billion (the “ 364-day
loan”), (ii) a
two-year
senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.0
billion (the “ two-year
loan”) and (iii) a
three-year
senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.0
billion (the “ three-year
loan”). An aggregate amount of $ 3.0  billion or more of the November 2021 DDTL was drawn for the purpose of funding the consideration due for the purchase of the increased equity interest in VillageMD, and paying fees and expenses related to the foregoing, and the remainder can be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity dates on the
364
days loan, the
two-year
loan and the
three-year
loan are February 15, 2023, November 24, 2023 and November 24, 2024, respectively. On February 14, 2023, the Company repaid the
364
days loan. As of February 28, 2023, there were $ 3.0
billion in borrowings outstanding under the November 2021 DDTL. Amounts borrowed under the November 2021 DDTL and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
Borrowings under the November 2021 DDTL bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, the alternate base rate, eurocurrency rate or, from and after the date that daily SOFR becomes available, the daily SOFR, plus an applicable margin. For the
364-day
tranche, the applicable margin was approximately
0.75 %. For the
2 -year and
3 -year tranche, the applicable margin is
0.85 % and
1.00 %, respectively. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 21 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks, including interest rate and currency risks, arising from operating and financing risks. The Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.

(UNAUDITED) Net investment hedges The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
Cash flow hedges The Company may use foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in forecasted transactions and cash flows of certain floating-rate debt. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, and released to the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of foreign currency risks. The Company also utilizes total return swaps to economically hedge variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations.
The income (expenses) due to changes in fair value of the derivative instruments were recognized in Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings as follows (in millions):     Three months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28,   Location in Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings 2023 2022 2023 2022 Foreign currency forwards Selling, general and administrative expenses

Excludes remeasurement gains and losses on economically hedged assets and liabilities. Derivatives credit risk Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty. Derivatives offsetting The Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Note 9.
Fair value measurements
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.

See Note 8. Financial instruments, for additional information. 3 The fair value of forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. See Note 8. Financial instruments, for additional information. 4 Includes investments in Treasury debt securities. 5 Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. There were no transfers between Levels for the six months ended February 28, 2023. The carrying value of the Company's commercial paper and credit facilities approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Company’s debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. As of February 28, 2023 the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of long term notes outstanding including the current portion were $ 7.6
billion and $ 6.8
billion, respectively. The fair values of the notes outstanding are Level 1 fair value measures and determined based on quoted market price and translated at the February 28, 2023 rate, as applicable. The fair values and carrying values of these issuances do not include notes that have been redeemed or repaid as of February 28, 2023. See Note 7. Debt, for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.

Commitments and contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities in pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other areas. Some of these proceedings may be class actions, and some involve claims for large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and they may remain unresolved for several years. Legal proceedings in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. The Company’s business, compliance and reporting practices are subject to intensive scrutiny under applicable regulation, including review or audit by regulatory authorities. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described herein. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private parties. In such an action, a private party purports to act on behalf of federal or state governments, alleges that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if its claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on its own purporting to act on behalf of the government. The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. We describe below certain proceedings against the Company in which the amount of loss could be material. We accrue for legal claims when, and to the extent that, the amount or range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have meritorious defenses in each of these proceedings, and we intend to defend each case vigorously, but there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined a material loss is reasonably possible, except as otherwise disclosed, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that is reasonably possible above any accrued amounts in these proceedings, due to various reasons, including: we have factual and legal arguments that, if successful, will eliminate or sharply reduce the possibility of loss; we do not have sufficient information about the arguments and the evidence plaintiffs will advance with respect to their damages; some of the cases have been stayed; certain proceedings present novel and complex questions of public policy; legal and factual determinations and judicial and governmental procedure; the large number of parties involved; and the inherent uncertainties related to such litigations. Litigation Relating to 2016 Goals On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co. and Walgreen Co., as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. (Cutler v. Wasson et al., No. 1:14-cv-10408 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015 (Washtenaw County Employees’ Retirement System v. Walgreen Co. et al., No. 1:15-cv-3187 (N.D. Ill.). On November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the resolution of the securities class action. The securities class action was resolved and a final judgement order entered on October 13, 2022. On March 24, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of a settlement resolving the litigation. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 25 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED) On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. ( Washtenaw County Employees’ Retirement System v. Walgreen Co. et al. , No. 1:15-cv-3187 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The Company’s motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint filed on August 17, 2015 was granted in part and denied in part on September 30, 2016. The court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification on March 29, 2018, and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on December 19, 2018. A motion to dismiss the first amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part on September 23, 2019. Fact discovery and expert discovery have concluded. On November 2, 2021, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ cross motion. On March 2, 2022 the Court granted the Company’s motion to reconsider a portion of that ruling. On June 29, 2022 the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement in the amount of $ 105  million, which was paid in fiscal 2022. The Court issued a final judgment order approving the settlement on October 13, 2022. Securities Claims Relating to Rite-Aid Merger On December 11, 2017, purported Rite Aid shareholders filed an amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the “M.D. Pa. class action”) arising out of transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between the Company and Rite Aid. The amended complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the transactions. The Court denied the Company’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint on April 15, 2019. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses, and the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Fact and expert discovery have concluded and summary judgement briefing is complete. In October and December 2020, two separate purported Rite Aid Shareholders filed actions in the same court opting out of the class in the M.D. Pa. class action and making nearly identical allegations as those in the M.D. Pa. class action (the “Opt-out Actions”). The Opt-out Actions have been stayed until the earlier of (a) 30 days after the entry of an order resolving any pre-trial dispositive motions in the M.D. Pa. class action, or (b) 30 days after the entry of an order of final approval of any settlement of the M.D. Pa. class action. Claims Relating to Opioid Abuse
The Company is among an array of defendants in multiple actions in federal courts alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse, which have been commenced by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others. In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated many of these cases in a consolidated multidistrict litigation, captioned
In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation
(MDL No. 2804, Case No. 17-md-2804), which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (“N.D. Ohio”). The Company is a defendant in the following multidistrict litigation (MDL) bellwether cases: • One case remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( City and Cnty. of San Francisco, et al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. , Case No. 3:18-cv-07591-CRB). Following a bench trial, the court entered a liability finding against Walgreens in August 2022. The court scheduled a second trial regarding remedies for November 2022 to determine how much is to be paid, but that proceeding has been continued indefinitely. The Company has the right to appeal any judgment but is unable to predict the outcome relative to remedies or apportionment as well as the outcome of any appeal as the trial is ongoing.
• Two cases in N.D. Ohio ( Cnty. of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. , Case No. 18-op-45032;
Cnty. of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. , Case No. 18-op-45079). In November 2021, the jury in that case returned a verdict after trial in favor of the plaintiffs as to liability, and a second trial regarding remedies took place in May 2022. In August 2022, the court entered orders providing for injunctive relief and requiring the defendants to pay $ 650.6  million over a
15 -year period to fund abatement programs. The court found that the damages are subject to joint and several liability and as such made no determination as to apportionment. These decisions are currently on appeal.
• One case remanded to the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma ( The Cherokee Nation v. McKesson Corp., et al. , Case No. 18-CV-00056-RAW-SPS), which was then remanded to the District Court of Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. The matter is stayed pursuant to a joint request from the parties. • Five additional bellwether cases designated in April 2021: (1)
Cobb Cnty. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. , Case No. 18-op-45817 (N.D. Georgia); (2)

Cnty. of Cuyahoga, Ohio, et al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P. , Case No. 18-op-45004), previously scheduled for trial in November 2020 but postponed indefinitely. The Company also has been named as a defendant in numerous actions brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. Trial dates have been set in cases pending in state courts in the following states:
• Nevada ( State of Nevada v. McKesson Corporation, et al. , Case No. A-19-796755-B, Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada - July 2023).
• Missouri ( Jefferson County, Missouri v. Dannie E. Williams, M.D., et al. , Case No. 20JE-CC00029, Twenty-Third Judicial Circuit, Jefferson County, Missouri - July 2024). • Florida ( Florida Health Sciences Center, Inc.,
et al. v. Richard Sackler, et al. ,
Case No. CACE 19-018882, Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County, Florida - May 2025). The relief sought by various plaintiffs in these matters includes compensatory, abatement, restitution and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company has received from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Attorneys General of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and other requests concerning opioid-related matters. The Company continues to communicate with the DOJ regarding purported violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act in dispensing prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances at its pharmacies nationwide. On May 5, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. This settlement agreement is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by the state and government subdivisions in the State of Florida. The estimated settlement amount of $ 683  million includes $ 620  million in remediation payments, which will be paid to the State of Florida in equal installments over
18
years, and will be applied as opioid remediation, as well as a one-time payment of $ 63  million for attorneys’ fees. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a $ 683  million liability associated with this settlement. On November 2, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms as part of settlement frameworks (the “Settlement Frameworks”) that have the potential to resolve a substantial majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against the Company by the attorneys general of participating states and political subdivisions (the “Settling States”) and litigation brought by counsel for tribes. Under the Settlement Frameworks with the Settling States and counsel for tribes, the Company announced that it expected to settle all opioid claims against it by such Settling States, their participating political subdivisions, and participating tribes for up to approximately $ 4.8  billion and $ 155  million, respectively in remediation payments to be paid out over
15
years. The Settlement Frameworks provide for the payment of up to approximately $ 754  million in attorneys’ fees and costs over
6
years beginning in year two of the Settlement Frameworks. The Settlement Frameworks include no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company. As of November 30, 2022, the Company concluded that Settlement Framework discussions had advanced to a stage where a broad settlement of opioid claims by Settling States was probable, and for which the related loss was reasonably estimable. As a result of those conclusions and the Company’s ongoing assessment of other opioid-related claims, the Company recorded a $ 6.5
billion liability associated with the Settlement Frameworks and other opioid-related claims and litigation settlements during the three months ended November 30, 2022. The settlement accrual is reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings within Selling, general and administrative expenses as part of the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Loss contingencies are highly subjective, the Company cannot predict if any agreement will become effective, and unpredictable or unfavorable developments can occur. The amount of the actual loss may differ materially from the accrual estimate.
As of February 28, 2023, the Company has accrued a total $ 7.4  billion liability associated with the Settlement Frameworks and other opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, including $ 1.0  billion and $ 6.4  billion of the estimated settlement liability in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Accrued litigation obligations, respectively, in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. On December 9, 2022, the Company committed the Settlement Frameworks to a proposed settlement agreement (the “Proposed Settlement Agreement”) that is contingent on (1) a sufficient number of Settling States, including those that have not sued, agreeing to the Proposed Settlement Agreement following a sign-on period, and (2) following a notice period, a sufficient number of political subdivisions within Settling States, including those that have not sued, agreeing to the Proposed Settlement Agreement (or otherwise having their claims foreclosed).

(UNAUDITED) Should some states or their political subdivisions decline to participate in the Proposed Settlement Agreement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that sufficient participation exists to warrant going forward with the settlement, during both of the two sign-on periods, there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the entities that do not participate. Those non-participating Settling States or political subdivisions would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company. The Company cannot predict if or when the Proposed Settlement Agreement will become effective. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any litigation not covered by the Proposed Settlement Agreement, including private plaintiff litigation. The Company continues to believe it has strong legal defenses and appellate arguments in all of these cases. Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation
The Company is defending a number of claims, lawsuits and investigations that allege that the Company’s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions have been brought by different types of plaintiffs, including insurance companies, plan members, government and private payors, based on different legal theories. At least one of these cases was brought as a putative class action.
Note 11.
Income taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was
11.5 %, compared to
18.2 % for the three months ended February 28, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance and impact of the opioid-related claims and litigation settlements. The Company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current period against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen. See Note 5. Equity method investments for further information. This benefit was partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible opioid-related claims recorded in the three months ended February 28, 2023. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was a benefit of
29.5 %, primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance and impact of the opioid-related claims and litigation settlements.
The Company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and based on forecasted capital gains. This benefit was partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible opioid-related claims recorded in the six months ended February 28, 2023. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was
9.4 %, primarily due to lower tax expense on gains from consolidation of the Company’s investment in VillageMD and Shields, as a portion of these gains were not subject to tax. See Note 2. Acquisitions and other investments for further information. Income taxes paid for the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 were $ 131
million and $ 201
million, respectively. Note 12.
Retirement benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan.
Defined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans) The Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the U.S. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the “Boots Plan”), which covers certain employees in the UK. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.

Defined contribution plans The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Company’s contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is made pursuant to the applicable plan document approved by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors. Plan activity is reviewed periodically by certain Committees of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision is an expense of $ 60

Segment reporting The Company is aligned into
three
reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare.
The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. U.S. Retail Pharmacy The Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise. International The Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and a pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products. U.S. Healthcare The Company’s U.S. Healthcare segment is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets. The U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in VillageMD, a leading national provider of value-based primary, urgent and multi-specialty care services; Shields, a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals; a majority position in CareCentrix, a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors, and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members’ caregivers through both digital and physical channels.

New accounting pronouncements Adoption of new accounting pronouncements Disclosures by business entities about government assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) – Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This ASU requires disclosures that are expected to increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2022, and the adoption did not impact the Company's disclosures within these consolidated condensed financial statements.
New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Acquired contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). This ASU is expected to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024). The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This ASU requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. This ASU is expected to improve financial reporting by requiring new disclosures about the programs, thereby allowing financial statement users to better consider the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024), except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025). The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. Note 18.

INTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Walgreens Boots Alliance” or the “Company”), is an integrated healthcare, pharmacy and retail leader serving millions of customers and patients every day, with a 170-year heritage of caring for communities. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: • U.S. Retail Pharmacy, • International, and • U.S. Healthcare. FACTORS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY The Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: impact of opioid litigation settlements, the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payor and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including United States (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; adjustments to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare Advantage and Medicare rates; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, including changes that would negatively impact our access to capital markets. Specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. To better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in March 2017, the Company and Prime Therapeutics LLC (“Prime”), a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy, PBM, and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. On December 31, 2021, the Company purchased Prime's portion of the joint venture and now wholly owns the joint venture, which was renamed AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients of AllianceRx Walgreens are not obligated to contract through AllianceRx Walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through AllianceRx Walgreens which impacts gross sales. However, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, the Company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 37 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Opioid litigation settlements On November 2, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms as part of settlement frameworks (the “Settlement Frameworks”) that have the potential to resolve a substantial majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against the Company by the attorneys general of participating states and political subdivisions (the “Settling States”) and litigation brought by counsel for tribes. The Company recorded a $6.5 billion liability associated with the Settlement Frameworks and other opioid-related claims and litigation during the three months ended November 30, 2022. The settlement accrual is reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings within Selling, general and administrative expenses as part of the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment.
As of February 28, 2023, the Company has accrued a total $7.4 billion liability associated with the Settlement Frameworks and other opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, including $1.0 billion and $6.4 billion of the estimated settlement liability in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Accrued litigation obligations, respectively, in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. See Note 10. Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. U.S. Healthcare In fiscal 2022, the Company announced the launch of its new healthcare strategy. The Company plans to become a leading provider of local clinical care services by leveraging its consumer-centric technology and retail pharmacy network to deliver value-based care. The Company’s goal is to provide better consumer experiences, improve health outcomes and lower costs. The Company’s U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets. The U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”), a leading national provider of value-based primary, urgent and multi-specialty care services; Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (“Shields”), a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals, a majority position in CCX Next, LLC (“CareCentrix”), a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors; and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members’ caregivers through both digital and physical channels.
See Note 14. Segment reporting to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. These and other factors can affect the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

TRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the “Transformational Cost Management Program”). The Company achieved this goal at the end of fiscal 2021. On October 12, 2021, the Company expanded and extended the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024 and increased its annual cost savings target to $3.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2022, the Company increased its annual cost savings target from $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently on track to achieve the savings target. The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company’s information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program which focus on the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International reportable segments along with the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within the Company’s segments includes activities such as optimization of stores, including plans to close approximately 350 Boots stores in the UK and approximately 450 to 500 stores in the U.S. As of February 28, 2023, the Company has closed 252 and 403 stores in the UK and U.S., respectively. The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful. WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net earnings (GAAP) for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to three months ended February 28, 2022
Net earnings attributable to the Company for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was $703 million compared to $883 million for the year-ago quarter. Diluted net earnings per share was $0.81 compared to $1.02 for the year-ago quarter. The decreases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect lower operating income partially offset by a $454 million after-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.
Operating income (loss) in the quarter reflects significantly lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing lapping the year-ago quarter's Omicron surge, a
$306 million pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, Summit Health acquisition costs, planned payroll investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, investments in U.S. Healthcare segment, and higher costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment and the growth in International segment. Other income (expense), net for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was $552 million compared to other expense of $198 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the $492 million pre-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen during the three months ended February 28, 2023 and the impairment loss of $190 million for certain equity investments recorded for the three months ended February 28, 2022. Interest expense, net was $141 million for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to $100 million for the three months ended February 28, 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher short-term benchmark interest rates and incremental facility borrowings associated with the Summit Health transaction in the current period. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was 11.5 percent, compared to 18.2 percent for three months ended February 28, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance and impact of the opioid-related claims and litigation settlements. The Company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current period against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen. See Note 5. Equity method investments for further information. This benefit was partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible opioid-related claims recorded in the three months ended February 28, 2023. Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP measure) for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to three months ended February 28, 2022
Adjusted net earnings attributable to the Company for the three months ended February 28, 2023 decreased 27.4 percent to $1.0 billion compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended February 28, 2023 decreased 27.2 percent to $1.16 compared with the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for the three months ended February 28, 2023 primarily reflects significantly lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing compared with the Omicron surge in the year-ago quarter, planned payroll investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy, and investments in U.S. Healthcare. This was partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. and International growth. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 42 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Net earnings (GAAP) for the six months ended February 28, 2023 compared to six months ended February 28, 2022 Net loss attributable to the Company for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $3.0 billion compared to net earnings of $4.5 billion for the year-ago period. Diluted net loss per share was $3.50 compared to diluted net earnings per share of $5.15 for the year-ago period. The decreases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share is driven by $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements partly offset by
the $1.4 billion after-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen in the six months ended February 28, 2023, lapping $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields in the year-ago period, and lower operating income reflecting a COVID-19 headwind, planned payroll and IT investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment and investments in U.S. Healthcare segment, partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment and growth in the International segment. Operating income (loss) in the period reflects a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, significantly lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, planned payroll and IT investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy, and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare, partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment and growth in the International segment. Other income (expense), net for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $1.5 billion compared to $2.4 billion for the year-ago period. The decrease in other income is mainly due to the gains on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields in the year-ago period, partly offset by the $1.5 billion pre-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Interest expense, net was $252 million for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $186 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher short-term benchmark interest rates and incremental facility borrowings associated with the Summit Health transaction in the current period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was a benefit of 29.5 percent primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance and impact of the opioid-related claims and litigation settlements. The Company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and based on forecasted capital gains. This benefit was partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible opioid-related claims recorded in the six months ended February 28, 2023. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 9.4 percent, primarily due to lower tax expense on gains from consolidation of the Company's investment in VillageMD and Shields, as a portion of these gains were not subject to tax. See Note 2. Acquisitions and other investments for further information. Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP measure) for the six months ended February 28, 2023 compared to six months ended February 28, 2022 Adjusted net earnings attributable to the Company for the six months ended February 28, 2023 decreased 29.2 percent to $2.0 billion compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2023 decreased 29.0 percent to $2.32 compared with the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for the six months ended February 28, 2023 primarily reflects lower adjusted operating income due to a COVID-19 headwind of approximately 23.7 percent, planned payroll and IT investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, and investments in U.S Healthcare segment, partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, and growth in the International segment.

2 Includes vaccinations, including COVID-19. 3 Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 4 Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively.

Sales for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to three months ended February 28, 2022
Sales for the three months ended February 28, 2023 decreased by 0.3 percent to $27.6 billion. Comparable sales increased by 3.1 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023. Pharmacy sales increased by 0.3 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and represented 72.1 percent of the segment’s sales. Pharmacy sales were negatively impacted by a 3.5 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. For the three months ended February 28, 2022, pharmacy sales decreased 3.3 percent and represented 71.6 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.9 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023, benefiting from branded drug inflation, compared to an increase of 7.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs, reduced pharmacy sales by 0.6 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to a reduction of 0.2 percent in the year-ago quarter. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 0.4 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to a reduction of 0.1 percent in the year-ago quarter. Within comparable pharmacy sales, 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled during the three months ended February 28, 2023 increased by 0.2% compared to the year-ago quarter.

three months ended
February 28, 2023 compared to $6.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit decreased 10.2 percent, primarily driven by
lower COVID-19 vaccine and testing volumes, reimbursement pressure, net of procurement savings, partially offset by improved retail gross profit driven by gross margin expansion and strong underlying performance across categories. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 20.0 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 18.8 percent for the three months ended February 28, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by a
$306 million pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements and planned labor investments, partly offset by cost savings from reduced labor for lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program.

This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. These items may include but are not limited to merger integration expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, asset impairments and other significant items that currently cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the previously announced opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other opioid-related matters. 2 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities. 3 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 4 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock compensation and employee transaction success bonuses. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance. 5 Adjustments to equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 56 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 6 The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. 7 Includes significant gains on the sale of equity method investments. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, the Company recorded a gain of $492 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, in Other income (expense), net, due to a partial sale of its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.
8 Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income (expense), net. We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance. 9 Impairment of equity method investment and investment in equity securities includes impairment of certain investments. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business and it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis. Exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Other income (expense), net. 10 Includes significant gains on business combinations due to the remeasurement of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value. During the three months ended November 30, 2021, the Company recorded such pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively. 11 During the three months ended February 28, 2022, the Company finalized the working capital adjustments with AmerisourceBergen related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business, resulting in a $38 million charge recorded to Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. 12 Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax (benefit) provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit). 13 Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post-tax earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. 14 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the six months ended February 28, 2023. 15 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes. 16 The Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. Healthcare segment to Operating loss as the closest GAAP measure for the segment profitability. The Company does not measure Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for its segments. 17 Includes GAAP stock-based compensation expense excluding expenses related to acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs.
The Company considers certain metrics presented in this report, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of co-located VillageMD clinics and number of total VillageMD/Summit/CityMD locations, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this report, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 57 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year. The Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Item 1A, Risk factors in the 2022 10-K. The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, continuing obligations for recently completed acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements, debt offerings, sale of marketable securities and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds to meet the Company's needs for at least the next 12 months. See Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.
Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash were $2.0 billion (including $197 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) and $2.6 billion (including $188 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds. On October 11, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 45% equity interest of CareCentrix for approximately $392 million of cash consideration, less transaction expenses. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. See Note 2. Acquisitions and other investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.
As of February 28, 2023, the Company has recorded a $7.4 billion liability to resolve a substantial majority of opioid-related claims and litigation settlements and is expected to make payments for remediation and legal fees over the next 15 years. See Note 10. Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. On March 2, 2023,
the Company entered into a $900 million unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum. See Note 19. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. On March 3, 2023, the Company sold approximately 15.5 million shares of Option Care Health for a total consideration of approximately $469 million. See Note 5. Equity method investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. At February 28, 2023, the Company had no guarantees outstanding and letters of credit issued were not material. See Note 7. Debt, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s debt instruments and its recent financing actions. Cash provided by operations, incurrence of debt and our investments are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $1.2 billion, compared to $2.2 billion for the year-ago period.
WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 58 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by lower earnings due to lapping COVID 19 vaccine and testing volumes partially offset by net working capital. Improvements in net working capital are primarily driven by higher cash inflows from trade accounts payable and lower cash outflows from inventory, partially offset by lower cash inflows from accounts receivable. Changes in accounts payable, inventories, and accounts receivable are mainly driven by ongoing working capital optimization efforts and timing. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used for investing activities was $3.6 billion for the six months ended February 28, 2023 compared to $2.2 billion for the year-ago period.
Net cash used for investing activities for the six months ended February 28, 2023 includes the Summit business acquisition, net of cash acquired of $6.7 billion partially offset by sale proceeds of $3.0 billion related to the Company's sale of 19.2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock, and proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions of $942 million.
Net cash used for investing activities for the six months ended February 28, 2022 includes business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of VillageMD and Shields for $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, and proceeds from the sale and leaseback transactions of $475 million. See Note 2. Acquisitions and other investments and Note 5. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statement for further information. Capital Expenditure Capital expenditure includes information technology projects and other growth initiatives. Additions to property, plant and equipment were as follows (in millions):   Six months ended February 28,   2023 2022 U.S. Retail Pharmacy $ 756  $ 632  International 143  155  U.S. Healthcare 208  83  Total additions to property, plant and equipment $ 1,108   $ 870
The increase in capital expenditure represents investment in growth initiatives, including the VillageMD footprint expansion, the rollout of micro-fulfillment centers, and digital transformation initiatives. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $1.8 billion compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $769 million in the year-ago period.
In the six months ended February 28, 2023, the Company received $2.5 billion in proceeds from the issuance of preferred units in VillageMD to Cigna as part of the Summit acquisition. In the six months ended February 28, 2023, there were $2.8 billion in proceeds from debt, primarily from issuance of commercial paper and credit facilities, compared to $11.2 billion in proceeds from debt, primarily from revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and the issuance of notes, in the year-ago period. In the six months ended February 28, 2023 there were $1.5 billion in payments of credit facilities, compared to $7.3 billion, primarily for revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, in the year-ago period. See Note 7. Debt, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.
The Company acquired $1.0 billion of Shields non-controlling interests in the six months ended February 28, 2023. The Company acquired $2.1 billion of non-controlling interests, primarily related to VillageMD, in the year-ago period. See Note 2. Acquisitions and other investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. The Company repurchased shares to offset dilution from equity incentive plans totaling $150 million and $187 million in the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 59 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Company paid cash dividends of $829 million and $833 million in the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively, Stock repurchase program In June 2018, the Company's Board of Director's approved a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of February 28, 2023. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws. Debt covenants Each of the Company’s credit facilities described in Note 7. Debt, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of February 28, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants. Credit ratings As of March 27, 2023, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were: Rating agency Long-term debt rating Commercial paper rating Outlook Moody’s Baa3 P-3 Negative Standard & Poor’s BBB A-2 Stable In assessing the Company’s credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Company’s business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company’s credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see the Company's fiscal 2022 10-K. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits, legal contingencies, and income taxes.

WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 61 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S. treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, announced that it will cease publication of LIBOR by June 2023. Certain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market for alternative benchmarks. Such an alternative benchmark rate could include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Information regarding the Company's transactions and financial instruments are set forth in Note 8. Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As of February 28, 2023, the Company had $4.0 billion of debt obligations at floating interest rates. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions).
The Company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of February 28, 2023, by approximately $49 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 5. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and “Investment in AmerisourceBergen” within Item 2 above. WBA Q2 2023 Form 10-Q 62 Table of Contents WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Item 4.
Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company had completed the acquisition of a majority equity interest in Summit. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in consolidation within the U.S. Healthcare segment. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired businesses. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2023. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting In the ordinary course of business, the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls. As we transform our business processes, we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions. These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via third-party outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems. These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness. As these changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended February 28, 2023 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
