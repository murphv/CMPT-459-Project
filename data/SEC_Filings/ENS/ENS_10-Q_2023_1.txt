Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments except those otherwise described herein) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.
The Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 25, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). EnerSys (the “Company”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2023 end on July 3, 2022, October 2, 2022, January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2022 ended on July 4, 2021, October 3, 2021, January 2, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively. The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including, but not limited to, the potential impacts arising from the coronavirus pandemic including its variants (“COVID-19”) and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts of COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, the incremental borrowing rate for lease liabilities, the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. 9 Table of Contents     2.
Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 18 and are consistent with how we organize and manage our operations, as well as product line net sales information. Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 amounted to $ 100,770
and $ 87,958 , respectively. Service revenues for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 amounted to $ 301,584
and $ 260,588 , respectively. A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require combining both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 amounted to $ 55,283
and $ 49,058 , respectively. Revenues recognized over time for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 amounted to $ 168,489
and $ 133,569 , respectively.
On January 1, 2023, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $ 159,245 , of which, the Company estimates that approximately $ 76,200
will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2023, $ 67,002
in fiscal 2024, and $ 16,043
in fiscal 2025.
Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when recognition of revenue is expected. As of January 1, 2023, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $ 30,859
and $ 1,482 , respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $ 27,870
and $ 1,387 , respectively. Revenues recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the quarter, amounted to $ 7,382
and $ 4,890 , respectively.
Revenues recognized during the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year, amounted to $ 9,167
and $ 6,722 , respectively. Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $ 54,006
and $ 59,924
as of January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At January 1, 2023, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $ 4,608
and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $ 9,484 . 3.
Leases The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from
1
to
17
years.
Short term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not presented on the balance sheet and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 10 Table of Contents     The following table presents lease assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classification: Classification As of January 1, 2023 As of

Accounts Receivable January 1, 2023 March 31, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 591,784   $ 731,653   Allowance for doubtful accounts
10,031   12,219   Accounts receivable, net $ 581,753   $ 719,434   During the third quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA), under which the Company continuously sells its interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivables, at a discount, to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution ("unaffiliated financial institution") on a monthly basis.
The Company may sell certain US-originated accounts receivable balances up to a maximum amount of $ 150,000 . In return for these sales, the Company receives a cash payment equal to the face value of the receivables and is charged a fee of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 85 basis points against the sold receivable balance. The program is conducted through EnerSys Finance LLC ("EnerSys Finance"), an entity structured to be bankruptcy remote, and matures in December 2025. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of EnerSys Finance as the Company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivables into the special purpose entity.
Accordingly, EnerSys Finance is included in the Company’s consolidated condensed financial statements.
Receivables sold to unaffiliated financial institutions under the program are excluded from “Accounts receivable, net” on the Company’s consolidated condensed balance sheets, and cash receipts are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows. The purchase price is received in cash when the receivables are sold, and fees charged relating to this balance are recorded to other (income) expense. Certain unsold receivables held by EnerSys Finance serve as collateral to unaffiliated financial institutions. These unsold
receivables
are
included
in
“Accounts
receivable,
net”
in
the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues servicing the receivables which were sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee from EnerSys Finance under the program.
During the third quarter and nine months of 2023, the Company sold $ 150,000
of accounts receivables for approximately
$ 149,700
in net proceeds to an unaffiliated financial institution, of which $ 25,623
were collected as of January 1, 2023. Total collateralized accounts receivables of approximately $ 252,664 , were held by EnerSys Finance at January 1, 2023. Any accounts receivables held by EnerSys Finance would likely not be available to other creditors of the Company in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings relating to the Company until the outstanding balances under the RPA are satisfied. Additionally, the financial obligations of EnerSys Finance to the unaffiliated financial institutions under the program are limited to the assets it owns and there is no recourse to the Company for receivables that are uncollectible as a result of the insolvency of EnerSys Finance or its inability to pay the account debtors.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2022 Annual Report. The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded. Financial Instruments The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Third Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 13), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2. In fiscal 2020, the Company issued its
4.375 % Senior Notes due December 15, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), with an original face value of $ 300,000 . The Company's
5.00 % Senior Notes due April 30, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), with an original face value of $ 300,000 , were issued in fiscal 2016. The fair value of the 2027 Notes and 2023 Notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The 2027 Notes were trading at approximately
90 % and
95 % of face value on January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The 2023 Notes were trading at approximately
99 % and
101 % of face value on January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
14 Table of Contents     The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and Senior Notes at January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were as follows:   January 1, 2023 March 31, 2022   Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Financial assets: Derivatives

Non-recurring fair value measurements On June 29, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which focused on manufacturing flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for traditional motive power flooded cells will decrease as customers transition to maintenance free product solutions in lithium and Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL). As a result, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable and recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 a write-off of $ 7,300
of the fixed assets, for which there is expected to be no salvageable value. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of fixed assets was a combination of the income and market approaches. The inputs used to measure the fair value of these fixed assets under the income approach were largely unobservable and accordingly were classified as Level 3. 8.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company utilizes derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest, under established procedures and controls. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and the Company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected.
Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Lead Forward Contracts The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately
65.0
million pounds and
54.0
million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $ 60,025
and $ 56,768 , respectively. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond
one year . As of January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company had entered into a total of $ 48,769
and $ 29,676 , respectively, of such contracts. 15 Table of Contents     Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Net Investment Hedges The Company uses cross currency fixed interest rate swaps to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro. On September 29, 2022, the Company terminated its $ 300,000
cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts, originally entered into on December 23, 2021, and received a net settlement of $ 43,384 . The cash proceeds have been included in Proceeds from termination of net investment hedges in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $ 150,000 , maturing on December 15, 2027. The cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting as a net investment hedging instrument, which allows for them to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI (“Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”) to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the foreign currency translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of income (expense).
Impact of Hedging Instruments on AOCI In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $ 11,280
of pretax (gain) relating to lead, foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges will be reclassified from AOCI as part of cost of goods sold and interest expense. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which will change as market rates change in the future. This amount will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead, foreign exchange rates and interest costs resulting from variable lead cost, foreign exchange and interest rates hedged. Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships Foreign Currency Forward Contracts The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the notional amount of these contracts was $ 67,252
and $ 22,990 , respectively.

Income Taxes The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company’s effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions, in which the Company operates, change in tax laws and the amount of the Company's consolidated earnings before taxes.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were
23.2 % and
15.3 % and for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were
18.5 % and
14.2 %, respectively. The rate increase in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to taxes associated with a modification of the Company’s indefinite reinvestment position related to undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries and changes in mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be
80 % for fiscal 2023 compared to
87 % for fiscal 2022. The foreign effective tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were
15 % and
10 %, respectively. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income for both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and were taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately
9 % and
8 %, respectively.

Warranty The Company provides for estimated product warranty expenses when products are sold, with related liabilities included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. As warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily historical claims experience, costs of claims may ultimately differ from amounts provided.
An analysis of changes in the liability for product warranties is as follows:   Quarter ended Nine months ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 52,394   $ 56,222   $ 54,978   $ 58,962   Current period provisions 7,557   4,237   18,958   11,898   Costs incurred ( 5,948 ) ( 6,269 ) ( 17,005 ) ( 15,641 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 1,197   221   ( 1,731 ) ( 808 ) Balance at end of period $ 55,200   $ 54,411   $ 55,200   $ 54,411   19 Table of Contents     11.
Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation Litigation and Other Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their activities. European Competition Investigations
Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. For additional information regarding these matters, see Note 19 -
Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation
to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2022 Annual Report. As of January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company did not have a reserve balance related to these matters.
The precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate may change from time to time, and actual losses could vary. Environmental Issues As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves to satisfy its environmental liabilities. Lead, Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Swaps To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency and interest rate movements, the Company entered into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of lead and foreign currency contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. The Company also entered into a cross currency fixed interest rate swap agreement, maturing on December 15, 2027, to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro.

Restructuring and other Exit Charges Restructuring Programs As disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report, the Company committed to restructuring plans aimed at improving operational efficiencies across its lines of business. A substantial portion of these plans are complete with an estimated $ 871
remaining to be incurred by the end of fiscal 2023, mainly related to plans started in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
Restructuring and exit charges for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023 by reportable segments are as follows: Quarter ended January 1, 2023 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Restructuring charges $ 266   $ 124   $ —   $ 390   Exit charges ( 108 ) 526   ( 7 ) 411   Restructuring and other exit charges $ 158   $ 650   $ ( 7 ) $ 801   Nine months ended January 1, 2023 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Restructuring charges $ 1,205   $ 276   $ —   $ 1,481   Exit charges ( 108 ) 11,028   ( 7 ) 10,913   Restructuring and other exit charges $ 1,097   $ 11,304   $ ( 7 ) $ 12,394   A roll-forward of the restructuring reserve, excluding exit charges, is as follows: Balance as of March 31, 2022 $ 1,030   Accrued 1,481   Costs incurred ( 1,607 ) Foreign currency impact
( 33 ) Balance as of January 1, 2023 $ 871   Exit Charges Fiscal 2023 Program On June 29, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for traditional motive power flooded cells will decrease as customers transition to maintenance free product solutions in lithium and TPPL. The Company currently estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $ 18,500 .
Cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses are estimated to be $ 9,200
and non-cash charges from inventory and fixed asset write-offs are estimated to be $ 9,300 . These actions will result in the reduction of approximately
165
employees. The plan is expected to be completed in calendar 2023.
During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded cash charges relating to severance and manufacturing variances of $ 2,263
and non-cash charges of $ 7,261
relating to fixed asset write-offs. The Company also recorded a non-cash write off relating to inventories of $ 1,613 , which was reported in cost of goods sold. Fiscal 2022 Program Hagen, Germany In fiscal 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to close substantially all of its facility in Hagen, Germany, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for the motive power batteries produced at this facility was not sufficient, given the conversion from flooded to maintenance free batteries by customers, the existing number of competitors in the market, as well as the near term decline in demand and increased uncertainty from the pandemic. The Company plans to retain the facility with limited sales, service and administrative functions along with related personnel for the foreseeable future.
The Company currently estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $ 60,000 , of which cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses were estimated to be $ 40,000
and non-cash charges from inventory and equipment write-offs were estimated to be $ 20,000 . The majority of these charges were recorded as of January 1, 2023. These actions resulted in the reduction of approximately
200
employees.
During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded cash charges relating to severance of $ 23,331
and non-cash charges of $ 7,946
primarily relating to fixed asset write-offs. During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded cash charges primarily relating to severance of $ 8,069
and non-cash charges of $ 3,522
primarily relating to fixed asset write-offs. The Company also recorded a non-cash write off relating to inventories of $ 960 , which was reported in cost of goods sold. During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded cash charges of $ 1,525
relating to primarily to site cleanup and $ 419
of non-cash charges relating to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets.
Russia In February 2022, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic sanctions were imposed on Russian individuals and entities, including financial institutions, by countries around the world, including the U.S. and the European Union. On March 3, 2022, the Company announced that it was indefinitely suspending its operations in Russia in order to comply with the sanctions. As a result of this decision, the Company wrote off net assets of $ 3,999
relating to its Russian subsidiary. The Company also incurred cash charges of $ 1,284
relating to severance and exiting lease obligations.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company sold inventory previously written off resulting in the reversal of $ 932
in cost of goods sold and reversal of $739 of cash charges primarily relating to lease obligations.
Targovishte, Bulgaria During fiscal 2019, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria, which produced diesel-electric submarine batteries. Management determined that the future demand for batteries of diesel-electric submarines was not sufficient given the number of competitors in the market. Of the estimated total charges of $ 26,000
for this plan, the Company had recorded charges amounting to $ 20,242
in fiscal 2019, relating to severance and inventory and fixed asset write-offs and an additional $ 5,123
relating to cash and non-cash charges during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, in keeping with its strategy of exiting the manufacture of batteries for diesel-electric submarines, the Company completed further actions which resulted in $ 220
relating to cash and non-cash charges. During the nine months of fiscal 2022, the Company sold this facility for $ 1,489 . A net gain of $ 1,208
was recorded as a credit to exit charges in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Income. Zamudio, Spain During the nine months of fiscal 2022, the Company closed a minor assembling plant in Zamudio, Spain and sold the same for $ 1,779 . A net gain of $ 740
was recorded as a credit to exit charges in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Income.

The 2017 Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on September 30, 2022, initially comprised a $ 600,000
senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $ 150,000
senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”). The Company utilized the borrowings from the 2017 Credit Facility to repay its pre-existing credit facility.
In fiscal 2019, the Company amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to fund the Alpha acquisition. The Amended Credit Facility consisted of $ 449,105
senior secured term loans (the “Amended Term Loan”), including a CAD
133,050
($ 99,105 ) senior secured term loan and a $ 700,000
senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolver”). The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $ 299,105
and $ 100,000 , respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Second Amended Credit Facility”). The Second Amended Credit Facility, scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026, consists of a $ 130,000
senior secured term loan (the “Second Amended Term Loan”), a CAD
106,440
($ 84,229 ) senior secured term loan and an $ 850,000
senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Second Amended Revolver”). The second amendment resulted in a decrease of the Amended Term Loan by $ 150,000
and an increase of the Amended Revolver by $ 150,000 .
The quarterly installments payable on the Second Amended Term Loan are $ 2,607
beginning December 31, 2022, $ 3,910
beginning December 31, 2024 and $ 5,213
beginning December 31, 2025 with a final payment of $ 156,402
on September 30, 2026. Both the Second Amended Revolver and the Second Amended Term Loan bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) plus (i) LIBOR plus between
1.125 % and
2.25 % (currently
1.75 % and based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio) or (ii) the U.S. Dollar Base Rate plus between
0.125 % and
1.25 %, (currently
0.75 % and based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio) which equals, for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus
0.50 %, (b) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate plus
1 %; provided that, if the Base Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed zero (iii) the CDOR Base Rate equal to the higher of (a) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (b) average 30-day CDOR rate plus
0.50 %. The Third Amended Credit Facility (defined below) provides for alternate benchmark rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) to replace LIBOR when it is phased out.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Third Amended Credit Facility”). The Third Amended Credit Facility provides a new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to $ 300,000
(the “Third Amended Term Loan”), which shall be available to draw at any time until March 15, 2023.
Once drawn, the funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term loan and Second Amended Revolver. In connection with the agreement, the Company incurred $ 1,161
in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized $ 1,096
in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset.
The Third Amended Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate amount of $ 350,000
in revolving commitments and / or one or more new tranches of term loans, under certain conditions. The Third Amended Term Loan bears interest, at the Company's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus
10
basis points plus (i) SOFR plus between
1.375 % and
2.50 % or (ii) the U.S. Dollar Base Rate plus between
0.375 % and
1.50 %, which equals, for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus
0.50 %, (b) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (c) the Term SOFR plus
1 %; provided that, if the Base Rate shall be less than zero, such
21 Table of Contents     rate shall be deemed zero).
Until the funds are drawn, the Company must pay a commitment fee of
0.175 % to
0.35 % (currently
0.30 % and based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio) at a rate per annum on the unused portion.
Obligations under the Third Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future acquired assets, including substantially all of the capital stock of the Company’s United States subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Third Amended Credit Facility and up to
65 % of the capital stock of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that are owned by the Company’s United States subsidiaries. The Third Amended Credit Facility allows for up to two temporary increases in the maximum leverage ratio to
4.50 x from
4.00 x to
4.25 x for a four quarter period following an acquisition larger than $ 250,000 . Effective with the Third Amended Credit Facility, the maximum leverage ratio increased from
3.50 x to
4.25 x effective to the last day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and decreasing subsequently to
4.00 x.
As of January 1, 2023, the Company had $ 305,000
outstanding under the Second Amended Revolver, $ 205,929
under the Second Amended Term Loan, and none outstanding under the Third Amended Term Loan.
Current Portion of Debt The current portion of the Second Amended Term Loan and the 2023 Notes are $ 10,428
and $ 300,000 , respectively, and are classified as long-term debt, as the Company
expects to refinance the future quarterly payments with borrowings under the Second Amended Revolver and redemption of the 2023 Notes with borrowings under the Third Amended Term Loan. Short-Term Debt As of January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 32,019

of standby letters of credit, respectively. Debt Issuance Costs In connection with the Second Amended Credit Facility, the Company capitalized $ 2,952

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of EnerSys. EnerSys and its representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in EnerSys’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and its reports to stockholders. Generally, the inclusion of the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “plans,” or the negative of such terms and similar expressions identify statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments that EnerSys expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to sales growth, earnings or earnings per share growth, and market share, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. The forward-looking statements are and will be based on management’s then-current beliefs and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and on information currently available to management, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of uncertainties and risks, including the risks described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (our “2022 Annual Report”) and other unforeseen risks. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if subsequently made available by us on our website or otherwise, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We design, manufacture, and distribute energy systems solutions and motive power batteries, specialty batteries, battery chargers, power equipment, battery accessories and outdoor equipment enclosure solutions to customers worldwide. Energy Systems, which combine power conversion, power distribution, energy storage, and enclosures, are used in the telecommunication, broadband, data center and utility industries, uninterruptible power supplies, and numerous applications requiring stored energy solutions. Motive Power batteries and chargers are utilized in electric forklift trucks, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and other industrial electric powered vehicles. Specialty batteries are used in aerospace and defense applications, large over the road trucks, premium automotive and medical products. We also provide aftermarket and customer support services to over 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distributors, independent representatives and our internal sales force around the world. The Company's three reportable segments, based on lines of business, are as follows: • Energy Systems -
uninterruptible power systems, or “UPS” applications for computer and computer-controlled systems, as well as telecommunications systems, switchgear and electrical control systems used in industrial facilities and electric utilities, large-scale energy storage and energy pipelines. Energy Systems also includes highly integrated power solutions and services to broadband, telecom, data center, and renewable and industrial customers, as well as thermally managed cabinets and enclosures for electronic equipment and batteries. • Motive Power -
power for electric industrial forklifts used in manufacturing, warehousing and other material handling applications, AGVs, as well as mining equipment, diesel locomotive starting and other rail equipment; and • Specialty -
premium starting, lighting and ignition applications in transportation, energy solutions for satellites, military aircraft, submarines, ships and other tactical vehicles as well as medical devices and equipment. Economic Climate The economic climate in North America, China and EMEA slowed in calendar 2022 after experiencing strong growth during calendar 2021. All regions are experiencing a rise in inflation and are being negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. We expect interest rates to continue to increase in the U.S. and the Euro zone. China’s slowing economy is facing further headwinds caused by continued high COVID-19 infection rates.
EnerSys is experiencing supply chain disruptions and cost spikes in certain materials such as plastic resins and electronic components along with transportation and related logistics challenges and broad-based cost increases. In addition, certain locations are experiencing difficulty meeting hiring and labor retention goals. Generally, our mitigation efforts and ongoing lean initiatives, have tempered the impact of the pandemic-related challenges. The overall market demand remains robust. Volatility of Commodities and Foreign Currencies Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively. Historically, volatility of commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates have caused large swings in our production costs. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have experienced a range in lead prices from just above $1.10 per pound to approximately $0.85 per pound. We are experiencing elevated costs in some of our other raw materials such as plastic resins, steel, copper, acid, separator paper and electronics and elevated freight and increased energy costs. Customer Pricing Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities. Approximately 30% of our revenue is now subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead. Customer pricing changes generally lag movements in lead prices and other costs by approximately six to nine months. In fiscal 2023, customer pricing has increased due to certain commodity prices and other costs having increased throughout the year. Based on current commodity markets, we expect to see continued headwinds from inflated commodity prices, labor and energy costs with related increases in our selling prices in the upcoming year. As we concentrate more on energy systems and non-lead chemistries, the emphasis on lead is expected to continue to decline.
35 Table of Contents     Primary Operating Capital As part of managing the performance of our business, we monitor the level of primary operating capital, and its ratio to net sales. We define primary operating capital as accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary operating capital percentage. We believe these three elements included in primary operating capital are most operationally driven, and this performance measure provides us with information about the asset intensity and operating efficiency of the business on a company-wide basis that management can monitor and analyze trends over time. Primary operating capital was $1,071.7 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 29.1%) at January 1, 2023, $1,042.0 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 28.7%) at March 31, 2022 and $989.9 million at January 2, 2022 (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 29.3%). The primary operating capital percentage of 29.1% at January 1, 2023 worsened by 40 basis points compared to March 31, 2022 and improved 20 basis points compared to January 2, 2022. The changes in the ratio are a result of the continued supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures across our business that have outweighed benefits received from the sale of $150.0 million in accounts receivables through a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA) entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Primary operating capital and primary operating capital percentages at January 1, 2023, March 31, 2022 and January 2, 2022 are computed as follows: ($ in Millions) January 1, 2023 March 31, 2022 January 2, 2022 Accounts receivable, net $ 581.8  $ 719.4  $ 636.0  Inventory, net 835.2  715.7  671.4  Accounts payable (345.3) (393.1) (317.5) Total primary operating capital $ 1,071.7  $ 1,042.0  $ 989.9  Trailing 3 months net sales $ 920.2  $ 907.0  $ 844.0  Trailing 3 months net sales annualized $ 3,680.8  $ 3,628.1  $ 3,376.0  Primary operating capital as a % of annualized net sales 29.1  % 28.7  % 29.3  % Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future, with $298 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn committed credit lines of approximately $843 million at January 1, 2023, availability subject to credit agreement financial covenants. A substantial majority of the Company’s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA). The RPA provides for EnerSys to sell up to $150 million of accounts receivable based on a borrowing base calculation. In December 2022 EnerSys sold $150.0 million of accounts receivables for approximately $149.7 million in net proceeds to an unaffiliated financial institution, of which $25.6 million were collected as of January 1, 2023.
Total collateralized accounts receivables of approximately $252.7 million were held by EnerSys Finance at January 1, 2023. The RPA is for a three-year term and matures on December 20, 2025. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Third Amended Credit Facility”). The Third Amended Credit Facility provides a new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to $300 million, which shall be available to draw at any time until March 15, 2023.
Once the Company draws the funds, they will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and Second Amended Revolver.
Our 5% Senior Notes mature on April 30, 2023, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. We expect to refinance the redemption of the 2023 Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with borrowings under the Third Amended Term Loan. During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 358,365 shares of common stock for approximately $22.9 million.
36 Table of Contents     We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisitions, stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments. Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales increased $76.2 million or 9.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This increase was the result of an 8% increase in pricing and a 5% increase in organic growth, partially offset by a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $268.3 million or 11.0% in the nine months of fiscal 2023 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2022. This increase was due to an 8% increase in both pricing and organic volume, partially offset by a 5% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Segment sales   Quarter ended

This increase was due to a 9% in pricing and 8% increase in organic growth, partially offset by a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales of our Energy Systems segment in the nine months of fiscal 2023 increased $153.7 million or 13.6% compared to the nine months of fiscal 2022. This increase was due to a 9% increase in both organic volume and pricing, partially offset by a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. This increase in sales was driven by improvement in pricing and organic volume primarily from the higher volume sales in battery sales in the Americas and improved power product sales in broadband and telecom. Net sales of our Motive Power segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased by $22.3 million or 6.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in pricing and a 3% increase in organic volume, partially offset by a 5% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales of our Motive Power segment in the nine months of fiscal 2023 increased by $71.4 million or 7.2% compared to the nine months of fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in pricing and 4% increase in organic volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.
We continue to benefit from continued improved pricing and favorable sales mix. Net sales of our Specialty segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased by $4.8 million or 4.1% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in pricing and a 1% increase in organic volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation. Net sales of our Specialty segment in the nine months of fiscal 2023 increased by $43.2 million or 13.2% compared to the nine months of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to a 10%
37 Table of Contents     increase in organic volume and a 6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. This increase in net sales was primarily driven by improved pricing and strong demand in primarily the transportation sector, which is restrained by our capacity growth in our Missouri plants.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 140 basis points and decreased 80 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. The increase in the gross profit margin in the current quarter reflects a strong performance in our price/mix, which more than offset year on year and sequential cost increases.
This step forward has helped to offset full year higher freight costs and component shortages from supply chain constraints along with other inflationary pressures in raw materials, labor, supplies and utilities, which still exceed pricing recoveries on a year to date basis, as well as adverse foreign currency translation impact. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased sequentially 150 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to impressive product price and mix improvements, representing the second sequential increase in gross profit margin since the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Restructuring and Other Exit Charges Restructuring Programs Included in our third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023 operating results of Energy Systems were restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Included in our third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023 operating results of Motive Power were restructuring charges of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Included in our third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022 operating results of Energy Systems were restructuring charges of $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Included in our third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022 operating results of Motive Power were restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
Exit Charges Fiscal 2023 Program On June 29, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for traditional motive power flooded cells will decrease as customers transition to maintenance free product solutions in lithium and TPPL. The Company currently estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $18.5 million.
Cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses are estimated to be $9.2 million and non-cash charges from inventory and fixed asset write-offs are estimated to be $9.3 million. These actions will result in the reduction of approximately 165 employees. The plan is expected to be completed in calendar 2023.
During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded cash charges relating primarily to severance and manufacturing variances of $2.3 million and non-cash charges of $7.3 million relating to fixed asset write-offs. The Company also recorded a non-cash write-off relating to inventories of $1.6 million, which was reported in cost of goods sold. Fiscal 2022 Programs Hagen, Germany In fiscal 2021, we committed to a plan to close substantially all of our facility in Hagen, Germany, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for the motive power batteries produced at this facility was not sufficient, given the conversion from flooded to maintenance free batteries by customers, the existing number of competitors in the market, as well as the near term decline in demand and increased uncertainty from the pandemic. We plan to retain the facility with limited sales, service and administrative functions along with related personnel for the foreseeable future.
We currently estimate that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $60.0 million of which cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses were estimated to be $40.0 million and non-cash charges from inventory and equipment write-offs were estimated to be $20.0 million. The majority of these charges have been recorded as of October 2, 2022. These actions resulted in the reduction of approximately 200 employees.
During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded cash charges relating to severance of $23.3 million and non-cash charges of $7.9 million primarily relating to fixed asset write-offs.
During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded cash charges, primarily relating to severance of $8.1 million and non-cash charges of $3.5 million primarily relating to fixed asset write-offs. The Company also recorded a non-cash write off relating to inventories of $1.0 million, which was reported in cost of goods sold.
During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded cash charges of $1.5 million relating primarily to site cleanup and $0.4 million of non-cash charges relating to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets.
39 Table of Contents     Russia In February 2022, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic sanctions were imposed on Russian individuals and entities, including financial institutions, by countries around the world, including the U.S. and the European Union. On March 3, 2022, the Company announced that it was indefinitely suspending its operations in Russia in order to comply with the sanctions. As a result of this decision, the Company wrote off net assets of $4.0 million relating to its Russian subsidiary. The Company also incurred cash charges of $1.3 million relating to severance and exiting lease obligations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company sold inventory previously written off resulting in the reversal of $0.9 million in cost of goods sold and reversal of $0.7 million of cash charges primarily relating to lease obligations.
Targovishte, Bulgaria During fiscal 2019, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria, which produced diesel-electric submarine batteries. Management determined that the future demand for batteries of diesel-electric submarines was not sufficient given the number of competitors in the market. During the nine months of fiscal 2022, the Company sold this facility for $1.5 million. A net gain of $1.2 million was recorded as a credit to exit charges in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Income.
Zamudio, Spain During the nine months of fiscal 2022, the Company closed a minor assembling plant in Zamudio, Spain and sold the same for $1.8 million. A net gain of $0.7 million was recorded as a credit to exit charges in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Income.

The percentages shown for the segments are computed as a percentage of the applicable segment’s net sales. Operating earnings increased $27.4 million or 53.5% and increased $21.2 million or 13.1% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased 240 basis points and 10 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022.
The Energy Systems operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, increased 380 basis points and 200 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. This increase in operating earnings was primarily as a result of higher volumes, price increases, and product mix improvement.
This improvement was offset by higher inflationary costs in raw materials, increasing freight costs, higher utility costs driving unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) costs, and adverse foreign currency translation impact.
The Motive Power operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, increased 150 basis points and decreased 100 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. This increase was driven by pricing actions and improved product mix offsetting inflationary pressure on costs and adverse foreign currency translation impact, whereas in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 inflation pressures were not fully mitigated by price increases. The Specialty operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, decreased 50 basis points and 260 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. Despite our efforts to mitigate inflationary pressure on costs with price increases, the decrease in operating earnings was driven by higher manufacturing costs, operating expenses and adverse foreign currency translation impact.

Interest expense of $44.5 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023 (net of interest income of $1.1 million) was $16.1 million higher than the interest expense of $28.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2022 (net of interest income of $1.7 million).
The increase in interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and nine months of fiscal 2023 is primarily due
to higher borrowing levels, higher short term interest rates, and an additional $1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees related to the Third Amended Credit Facility, partially offset by the benefit from the $300 million and $150 million cross currency fixed interest rate swaps. Our average debt outstanding was $1,300.2 million and $1,361.6 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, compared to $1,184.0 million and $1,105.8 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022. In connection with the Second Amended Credit Facility, we capitalized $3.0 million in debt issuance costs and wrote off $0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.5 million and $1.5 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared to $0.5 million and $1.6 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2022.
In connection with the Third Amended Credit Facility, we incurred $1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized $1.1 million in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset.

The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. Our effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions, in which we operate, change in tax laws and the amount of our consolidated earnings before taxes.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 23.2% and 15.3%, respectively, and were 18.5% and 14.2% for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The rate increase in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to taxes associated with a modification of the Company’s indefinite reinvestment position related to undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries and changes in mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 43 Table of Contents     Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 80% for fiscal 2023 compared to 87% for fiscal 2022. The foreign effective tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 14.5% and 10.2%, respectively. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income for both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and were taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 9% and 8%, respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2022 Annual Report.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow and Financing Activities Operating activities provided cash of $135.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to $78.0 million of cash used in the nine months of fiscal 2022, with the increase in operating cash resulting mainly due to activity in accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. Accounts receivable decreased or provided cash of $123.4 million due to sale of $150.0 million accounts receivable under the RPA entered into December 21, 2022. Inventory increased or used cash of $135.9 million. All components of inventory increased due to strategic investment, supply chain delays, new products and higher inventory costs from higher raw material costs, manufacturing and freight costs and to address the high backlog of customer orders. Accounts payable decreased or used cash of $31.6 million due to seasonal reduction.
In the nine months of fiscal 2023, net earnings were $109.9 million, depreciation and amortization $69.0 million, stock-based compensation $18.8 million, non-cash charges relating to exit charges $8.4 million, primarily relating to the Ooltewah, Tennessee plant closure, derivative losses of $1.4 million, non-cash interest of $1.5 million, and allowance for doubtful debts of $0.7 million. Prepaid and other current assets were a use of funds of $8.3 million, primarily from an increase of $13.6 million in other prepaid expenses, such as taxes, insurance and other advances, partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in contract assets. Accrued expenses were a use of funds of $17.1 million primarily from payroll related payments of $10.4 million net of accruals, tax payments net of accruals of $10.4 million, interest payments net of accruals of $6.2 million, partially offset by deferred income and contract liabilities of $3.9 million, freight charges of $3.5 million, warranty accruals of $1.2 million, other miscellaneous accruals of $1.3 million.
In the nine months of fiscal 2022, operating activities used cash of $78.0 million primarily from the activity in accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.
Inventory and accounts receivable increased or used cash of $163.7 million and $40.3 million, respectively, and accounts payable decreased or used cash of $9.1 million. In the nine months of fiscal 2022, net earnings were $115.8 million, depreciation and amortization $72.3 million, stock-based compensation $15.8 million, non-cash charges relating to exit charges $3.9 million, primarily relating to the Hagen, Germany plant closure, allowance for doubtful debts of $1.9 million and non-cash interest of $1.6 million. Prepaid and other current assets were a use of funds of $18.3 million, primarily from an increase of $14.4 million in other prepaid expenses, such as taxes, insurance and other advances, as well as an increase of $3.9 million of contract assets. Accrued expenses were a use of funds of $58.2 million primarily from payroll related payments of $23.1 million, income tax payments of $20.4 million, Hagen severance payments of $19.6 million and interest payments net of accrual of $7.0 million, partially offset by customer advances of $11.7 million. Investing activities used cash of $13.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023, which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $57.5 million relating to plant improvements, partially offset by proceeds from termination of a net investment hedge of $43.4 million.
Investing activities used cash of $47.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2022, which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $52.4 million relating to plant improvements. We also received $3.3 million from the sale of our facilities in Europe. Financing activities used cash of $202.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023. During the nine months of fiscal 2023, we borrowed $291.1 million under the Second Amended Revolver and repaid $422.1 million of the Second Amended Revolver and $1.6 million of the Second Amended Term loan. Net repayments on short-term debt were $20.3 million. Treasury stock open market purchases were $22.9 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $21.4 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $6.4 million. Payments for financing costs for debt modification were $1.1 million. Proceeds from stock options were $1.1 million. 44 Table of Contents     Financing activities provided cash of $76.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2022. During the nine months of fiscal 2022, we borrowed $424.8 million under the Second Amended Revolver and repaid $39.8 million of the Second Amended Revolver. Repayment on the Second Amended Term Loan was $161.4 million and net payments on short-term debt were $0.3 million. Treasury stock open market purchases were $114.5 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $22.2 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $9.1 million. Debt issuance costs relating to the refinancing of the 2017 Credit Facility was $3.0 million. Proceeds from stock options were $1.3 million.
Currency translation had a negative impact of $23.8 million on our cash balance in the nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the negative impact of $5.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2022. In the nine months of fiscal 2023, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Polish zloty, Swiss Franc and British pound generally weakened versus the U.S. dollar.
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $104.4 million to $298.1 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease by $54.7 million to $397.1 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2022. Compliance with Debt Covenants On July 15, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to our 2017 Credit Facility that resulted in the extension of the maturity date for the Second Amended Credit Facility to September 30, 2026, resetting of the principal amortization with respect to the Second Amended Term Loan, refinancing and reducing the existing Amended Term Loan, increasing the existing Amended Revolver, and certain other modifications. On September 8, 2022, we entered into a third amendment to our 2017 Credit Facility. The Third Amended Credit Facility provides a new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to $300,000 (the “Third Amended Term Loan”), which shall be available to draw at any time until March 15, 2023. Once drawn, the funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and the Second Amended Revolver.
All obligations under our Third Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Third Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility. We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our Third Amended Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe that we will continue to comply with these covenants and conditions, and that we have the financial resources and the capital available to fund the foreseeable organic growth in our business and to remain active in pursuing further acquisition opportunities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Annual Report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of our debt.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations of our 2022 Annual Report. As of January 1, 2023, we had no significant changes to our contractual obligations table contained in our 2022 Annual Report. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed. 45 Table of Contents     Counterparty Risks We have entered into lead forward purchase contracts, foreign exchange forward and purchased option contracts and cross currency fixed interest rate swaps to manage the risk associated with our exposures to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. Those contracts that result in a liability position at January 1, 2023 are $15.7 million (pre-tax). Those contracts that result in an asset position at January 1, 2023 are $9.9 million (pre-tax). The impact on the Company due to nonperformance by the counterparties has been evaluated and not deemed material. We hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. On September 29, 2022, we terminated our cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and executed cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $150 million, maturing on December 15, 2027. Depending on the movement in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro at maturity, the Company may owe the counterparties an amount that is different from the notional amount of $150 million. Excluding our cross currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, the vast majority of these contracts will settle within one year. Interest Rate Risks We are exposed to changes in variable U.S. interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreements as well as short-term borrowings in our foreign subsidiaries.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased annual interest expense, by approximately $5.4 million on the variable rate portions of our debt. Commodity Cost Risks – Lead Contracts We have a significant risk in our exposure to certain raw materials. Our largest single raw material cost is for lead, for which the cost remains volatile. In order to hedge against increases in our lead cost, we have entered into forward contracts with financial institutions to fix the price of lead. A vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. We had the following contracts outstanding at the dates shown below:   Date $’s Under Contract (in millions) # Pounds Purchased (in millions) Average Cost/Pound Approximate % of Lead Requirements  (1) January 1, 2023 $ 60.0  65.0  $ 0.92  10  % March 31, 2022 56.8  54.0  1.05  8  January 2, 2022 49.9  48.0  1.04  8  (1)
Based on the fiscal year lead requirements for the periods then ended. For the remaining quarter of this fiscal year, we believe approximately 100% of the cost of our lead requirements is known. This takes into account the hedge contracts in place at January 1, 2023, lead purchased by January 1, 2023 that will be reflected in future costs under our FIFO accounting policy, and the benefit from our lead tolling program.
We estimate that a 10% increase in our cost of lead would have increased our cost of goods sold by approximately $17 million and $60 million in the third quarter and in the nine months of fiscal 2023. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks We manufacture and assemble our products globally in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Approximately 40% of our sales and related expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Our sales revenue, production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Additionally, as we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars, our financial results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. 46 Table of Contents     We quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures. Our largest foreign currency exposure is from the purchase and conversion of U.S. dollar based lead costs into local currencies in Europe. Additionally, we have currency exposures from intercompany financing and intercompany and third party trade transactions. On a selective basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase option contracts to reduce the impact from the volatility of currency movements; however, we cannot be certain that foreign currency fluctuations will not impact our operations in the future. We hedge approximately 5% - 10% of the nominal amount of our known foreign exchange transactional exposures. We primarily enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. We also selectively hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, to hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. At January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% movement in the exchange rates would have adversely changed our hedge valuations by approximately $11.0 million and $42.2 million, respectively.
