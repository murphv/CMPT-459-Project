Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statement Preparation
The unaudited consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2023, and for the quarters ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, have been prepared by Starbucks Corporation under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, the financial information for the quarters ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 reflects all adjustments and accruals, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“10-Q”), Starbucks Corporation is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Certain prior period information on the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The financial information as of October 2, 2022 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) included in Item 8 in the Fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K”). The information included in this 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the footnotes and management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements in the 10-K. The results of operations for the quarter ended January 1, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending October 1, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”).
The novel coronavirus, known as the global COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in December 2019 before spreading to markets where we have company-operated or licensed stores. We have since established the necessary protocols to operate safely, and in many of our markets, our businesses demonstrated powerful momentum beyond recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, our China market continued to experience pandemic-related business interruptions, including escalating COVID outbreaks that suppressed customer mobility. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business and results of operations; however, we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its future impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Restructuring In fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the investments in partner wages and trainings will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the quarter ended January 1, 2023. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material. As of January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statement s. Note 2:
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents Note 3:
Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates
From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. Treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to  Note 8 , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency
To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in
Note 5,
Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. 10 Table of Contents Gains and losses on derivative contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedging instruments included in AOCI and expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months, net of tax ( in millions ): Net Gains/(Losses)

Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of January 1, 2023, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 333.3
million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 773.2
million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See
Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. 15 Table of Contents Note 6:

Debt Revolving Credit Facility Our $ 3.0
billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $ 150
million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on
September 16, 2026 . The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 1.0
billion. Borrowings under the 2021 credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus
0.500 %, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus
1.000 %. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
No
amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of January 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022. Short-term Debt Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $ 3.0
billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed
397
days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of January 1, 2023, we had
no
borrowings outstanding under the program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $ 175.0
million in borrowings outstanding under this program. Additionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market: • A ¥ 5
billion, or $ 37.6
million, credit facility is currently set to mature on
January 4, 2024 . Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR") plus an applicable margin of
0.400 %.
• A ¥ 10
billion, or $ 75.2
million, credit facility is currently set to mature on
March 27, 2023 . Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of
0.350 %.
As of January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we had
no
borrowings outstanding under these Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities. 18 Table of Contents Long-term Debt Components of long-term debt including the associated interest rates and related estimated fair values by calendar maturity ( in millions, except interest rates) : Jan 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Stated Interest Rate Effective Interest Rate (1) Issuance Amount Estimated Fair Value Amount Estimated Fair Value March 2023 notes $ 1,000.0   $ 996.6   $ 1,000.0   $ 996.5   3.100   % 3.107   % October 2023 notes (2) 750.0   745.0   750.0   744.8   3.850   % 2.859   % February 2024 notes (3) 500.0   496.8   500.0   497.3   4.590   % 4.821   % March 2024 notes (4) 639.0   653.5   588.4   584.7   0.372   % 0.462   % August 2025 notes 1,250.0   1,225.3   1,250.0   1,209.6   3.800   % 3.721   % June 2026 notes 500.0   465.6   500.0   458.3   2.450   % 2.511   % March 2027 notes 500.0   447.5   500.0   437.9   2.000   % 2.058   % March 2028 notes 600.0   565.2   600.0   554.8   3.500   % 3.529   % November 2028 notes 750.0   713.8   750.0   704.7   4.000   % 3.958   % August 2029 notes (2) 1,000.0   924.7   1,000.0   900.3   3.550   % 3.840   % March 2030 notes 750.0   625.2   750.0   607.7   2.250   % 3.084   % November 2030 notes 1,250.0   1,052.7   1,250.0   1,017.9   2.550   % 2.582   % February 2032 notes 1,000.0   857.8   1,000.0   827.1   3.000   % 3.155   % June 2045 notes 350.0   296.4   350.0   281.5   4.300   % 4.348   % December 2047 notes 500.0   381.5   500.0   369.6   3.750   % 3.765   % November 2048 notes 1,000.0   866.6   1,000.0   824.6   4.500   % 4.504   % August 2049 notes 1,000.0   857.0   1,000.0   817.8   4.450   % 4.447   % March 2050 notes 500.0   356.1   500.0   342.0   3.350   % 3.362   % November 2050 notes 1,250.0   906.3   1,250.0   874.9   3.500   % 3.528   % Total 15,089.0   13,433.6   15,038.4   13,052.0   Aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized premium/(discount), net ( 114.0 ) ( 117.2 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment (2) ( 49.0 ) ( 52.3 ) Total $ 14,926.0   $ 14,868.9   (1) Includes the effects of the amortization of any premium or discount and any gain or loss upon settlement of related treasury locks or forward-starting interest rate swaps utilized to hedge interest rate risk prior to the debt issuance.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings In 2010 and 2011, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed lawsuits in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and other companies who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee. The suits were later consolidated into a single action. Plaintiff alleged that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. Plaintiff sought equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per alleged violation of Proposition 65, which the Plaintiff claimed was every day coffee is sold without a compliant warning. The Company denied the claims. During the pendency of the litigation, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65. The regulation was approved by the Office of Administrative Law and became effective on October 1, 2019. In 2020, the trial court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, ruling that the coffee exemption regulation is a complete defense to the Plaintiff’s complaint. On October 26, 2022, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff’s subsequent request for a rehearing before the California Court of Appeals was denied. On December 2, 2022 Plaintiff filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court and Starbucks filed a response brief on December 22, 2022. Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a material loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2023, no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter. 23 Table of Contents Starbucks is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Introduction and Overview Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 84 markets. As of January 1, 2023, Starbucks had more than 36,100 company-operated and licensed stores, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Additionally, we sell a variety of consumer-packaged goods, primarily through the Global Coffee Alliance established with Nestlé and other partnerships and joint ventures. During the quarter ended January 1, 2023, our global comparable store sales
25 Table of Contents grew 5%, primarily driven by 10% growth in the U.S. market, partially offset by COVID-19 pandemic-related business conditions in China, leading to a 29% decrease in China comparable store sales. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada, 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. We believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics: • New store openings and store count • Comparable store sales growth • Operating margin Comparable store sales growth represents the percentage change in sales in one period from the same prior year period for company-operated stores open for 13 months or longer and exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We analyze comparable store sales growth on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of store closures, unless otherwise noted.
Starbucks results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand, despite continued COVID-19 pandemic related disruptions in our China market and continued inflationary pressures. Consolidated net revenues increased 8% to $8.7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $8.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by COVID-19 pandemic related disruptions in China and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated operating margin decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 14.4%, primarily driven by previously committed investments in labor including enhanced store partner wages and benefits, inflationary pressures and sales deleverage in China, partially offset by strategic pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. For both the North America segment and our U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 10% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of 18% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Average ticket for both the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 9%, primarily driven by strategic pricing. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits, as well as increased supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. For the International segment, comparable store sales declined 13% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by comparable store sales decline of 29% in our China market, which experienced suppressed customer mobility and store closures due to pandemic-related restrictions and a spike in infections. These contributed to a decline in both revenue and operating margin for the segment. The unfavorable impacts were partially offset by strong growth in our major international markets outside of China. Net revenues for our Channel Development segment increased $61 million, or 15%, when compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This was due to higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our ready-to-drink business. Despite COVID-19 induced business interruptions in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. While we anticipate continued inflationary pressure, albeit to a lesser extent than in fiscal 2022, and COVID-related interruptions in the China market, we expect improved financial performance in the second half of fiscal 2023, driven by sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from Reinvention, as well as recovery in China. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, we believe our strategy will result in sustainable and profitable growth over the long-term. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations

Total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $664 million, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($361 million). The growth of company-operated stores revenue was driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($328 million), attributable to a 7% increase in average ticket offset by a 2% decrease in comparable transactions. Also contributing was incremental revenues from 1,005 net new Starbucks ®
company-operated stores, or a 6% increase, over the past 12 months ($259 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($225 million). Licensed stores revenue increased $269 million contributing to the increase in total net revenues, driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($299 million). Partially offsetting this increase was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($35 million). Other revenues increased $34 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance.

Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher supply chain costs driven by inflationary pressures. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated stores revenue increased 110 basis points, primarily due to enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 350 basis points) and increased spend on new partner training (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage. Other operating expenses increased $28 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher support costs for our growing licensed markets ($8 million) and strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($8 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to lapping amortization expenses of acquisition-related intangibles assets. 27 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses increased $55 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($28 million) and increased support costs to address labor market conditions and leadership training ($17 million). Income from equity investees increased $18 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 20 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Other Income and Expenses

Interest income and other, net increased $12 million, primarily due to lower net losses from certain investments. Interest expense increased $14 million, primarily due to rising interest rates on floating rate debt and additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2022. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended January 1, 2023 was 24.6% compared to 23.2% for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation excess tax benefits (approximately 150 basis points). 28 Table of Contents Segment Information Results of operations by segment

Also contributing to these increases were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($183 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($160 million). Operating Margin North America operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 12% to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 18.5%, primarily due to investments in labor, including enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 390 basis points), inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 210 basis points), as well as increased spend on new partner training (approximately 70 basis points). These were partially offset by strategic pricing (approximately 510 basis points) and sales leverage. 29 Table of Contents International   Quarter Ended   Jan 1, 2023 Jan 2, 2022 $ Change Jan 1, 2023 Jan 2, 2022 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 1,212.9  $ 1,508.3  $ (295.4) 72.2  % 80.4  % Licensed stores 439.5  334.9  104.6  26.2  17.9  Other 27.7  32.7  (5.0) 1.6  1.7  Total net revenues 1,680.1   1,875.9   (195.8) 100.0   100.0   Product and distribution costs 593.6  615.8  (22.2) 35.3  32.8  Store operating expenses 633.9  697.6  (63.7) 37.7  37.2  Other operating expenses 50.7  39.2  11.5  3.0  2.1  Depreciation and amortization expenses 81.5  133.1  (51.6) 4.9  7.1  General and administrative expenses 80.5  91.3  (10.8) 4.8  4.9  Total operating expenses 1,440.2  1,577.0  (136.8) 85.7  84.1  Income from equity investees 0.5  0.7  (0.2) —  —  Operating income $ 240.4   $ 299.6   $ (59.2) 14.3   % 16.0   % Store operating expenses as a % of company-operated stores revenue 52.3  % 46.3  % For the quarter ended January 1, 2023 compared with the quarter ended January 2, 2022

This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($28 million) and increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($9 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance based compensation ($12 million). 32 Table of Contents Quarterly Store Data Our store data for the periods presented is as follows:   Net stores opened/(closed) and transferred during the period       Quarter Ended Stores open as of Jan 1, 2023 Jan 2, 2022 Jan 1, 2023 Jan 2, 2022 North America Company-operated stores 40  39  10,256  9,900  Licensed stores 46  23  7,125  6,988  Total North America 86  62  17,381  16,888  International Company-operated stores 97  213  8,134  7,485  Licensed stores 276  209  10,655  9,944  Total International 373  422  18,789  17,429  Total Company 459   484   36,170   34,317   Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion as of January 1, 2023 and $3.5 billion as of October 2, 2022. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of January 1, 2023, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investment were held in foreign subsidiaries.
Borrowing Capacity Revolving Credit Facility Our $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the 2021 credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 1.000%. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of January 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022. Commercial Paper Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of January 1, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding
33 Table of Contents under this program. Our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2023. Credit facilities in Japan Additionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities for the use of our Japan subsidiary. These are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market. • A ¥5 billion, or $37.6 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.
• A ¥10 billion, or $75.2 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2023. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.350%. As of January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities. See
Note 8,
Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q for details of the components of our long-term debt. Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. While we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity requirements, any foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.53 per share to be paid on February 24, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2023. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we resumed our share repurchase program which was temporarily suspended in April 2022. During the quarter ended January 1, 2023, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $191.4 million. As of January 1, 2023, 50.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2023 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.
34 Table of Contents In the MD&A included in the 10-K, we disclosed that we had $33.2 billion of current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 2, 2022. There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements during the period covered by this 10-Q outside of the normal course of our business. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $1.9 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to the timing of payments, lower non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses in current year, and net cash used by changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $279 million, compared to cash used in investing activities of $401 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in maturities and calls of investments, partially offset by higher spend on capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $1.0 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of $4.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities. Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions Commodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality
arabica
coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details, see Product Supply in Item 1 of the 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 10-K. Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that result in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Additionally, as our stored value cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from our stored value cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.

Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our interim chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (January 1, 2023). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 36 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
