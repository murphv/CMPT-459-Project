with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted as allowed by
such rules and regulations, and management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
These financial statements include all of the adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to a fair presentation of
financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto on December 31, 2019, as presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes these estimates using the best information
available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to
such estimates and assumptions include valuation of inventory, and recoverability of carrying amount, and the estimated useful lives
of long-lived assets.
Income
taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” . Under FASB ASC 740, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. FASB ASC 740-10-05,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
prescribes
a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities.
The
amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
50
percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. The Company assesses the validity of its conclusions regarding uncertain tax positions quarterly to determine if facts or
circumstances have arisen that might cause it to change its judgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position’s sustainability
under audit.
Net
Loss per Share
Net
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined
by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”)
calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.

GOING CONCERN
As
of September 30, 2020, the Company had $ 1,539,946
in cash and cash equivalents. The Company had a net loss of $ 16,315
for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, and has negative working capital of $ 5,337,989
and an accumulated deficit of $ 5,521,910
on September 30, 2020.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as financial support from
related parties. The Company’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if
the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase
revenue and/or manage operating expenses in line with revenue forecasts, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The
Company will focus on improving operational efficiency and cost reduction, developing core cash-generating business, and enhancing marketing
function. Actions include developing more customers, as well as creating synergy using the Company’s resources.
The
Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, the cash provided by its receiver, should enable the Company to meet presently
anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months after the date that the financial statements are issued and the Company has prepared
the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. If the Company encounters unforeseen circumstances that place constraints
on its capital resources, management will be required to take various measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily
be limited to, obtaining financial support from related parties, and controlling overhead expenses. Management cannot provide any assurance
that the Company’s efforts will be successful. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Organizational
History of the Company and Overview
No
Current Operations
Plan
of Operation
The
Company has no operations from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company and has no revenue from
continuing operations as of the date of this Report.
Management
intends to explore and identify business opportunities within the U.S., including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through
a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction. Our previous Chief Executive Officer has experience in business consulting,
although no assurances can be given that he can identify and implement a viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result
in profits. Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties
which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and
global economies.
We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12-month period we anticipate incurring
costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating
an acquisition of an operating business.
Given
our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or
is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets.
As
of the date of this Report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential
business combination. Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such
event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early-stage entity.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our
management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
Our
management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification
will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent
we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographical region.
We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions,
including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages
of available capital, management believes that there are a number of firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted
rates with which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different
industries or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. Once we have developed and begun to implement our business
plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of
debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan
and commencement of operations.
9
Based
upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able
to close a reverse merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties,
we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with
a reverse merger, we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target’s shareholders which will be
very dilutive.
Additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports
with the SEC. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in
their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition
of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully
execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.” The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.
Our
significant accounting policies are fully described in
Note 2
to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report, and we believe those accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation
of our financial statements.

3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer
or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
●
pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets;
●
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and
●
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has
concluded that as of September 30, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses:
●
The
Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one officer and limited resources.
●
The
Company does not have an independent board of directors or an audit committee.
●
The
Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures.
●
All
of the Company’s financial reporting is carried out by a financial consultant.
We
plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors, establishing written policies and procedures for
our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger
or similar business acquisition.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
There
have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year September 30, 2020 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
