Forw ard-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” with respect to the financial conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC (the “Fund”). Statements preceded by, followed by or that include words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify some of the forward-looking statements. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this Quarterly Report that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in market prices and conditions, the Fund’s operations, the plans of Grayscale Investments, LLC (the “Manager”) and references to the Fund’s future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially from such statements. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Manager made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Manager’s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein. Forward-looking statements are made based on the Manager’s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and neither the Fund nor the Manager is under a duty or undertakes an obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, other than as required by applicable laws. Investors are therefore cautioned against relying on forward-looking statements.
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” in this Quarterly Report refer to the Manager acting on behalf of the Fund.
A glossary of industry and other defined terms is included in this Quarterly Report, beginning on page

This Quarterly Report supplements, and where applicable amends, the Memorandum, as defined in the Fund’s Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, for general purposes.
Industry and
Market Data
Although we are responsible for all disclosure contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in some cases we have relied on certain market and industry data obtained from third-party sources that we believe to be reliable. Market estimates are calculated by using independent industry publications in conjunction with our assumptions regarding the digital asset industry and market.

GRAYSCALE digital large cap fund llc
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC (the “Fund”) was constituted as a Cayman Islands limited liability company on January 25, 2018 (the inception of the Fund) and commenced operations on February 1, 2018. In general, the Fund will hold digital assets. Historically, and through the period ending June 30, 2022, a digital asset had been eligible for inclusion in the Fund’s portfolio if it satisfied market capitalization, liquidity and coverage criteria as determined by the Manager (as defined below). Effective July 1, 2022, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Fund’s digital assets consist of digital assets that comprise the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index (the “DLCS”), as rebalanced from time to time, subject to the Manager’s discretion to exclude individual digital assets in certain cases. The DLCS is designed and managed by CoinDesk Indices, Inc. (in this capacity, the “Index Provider”) as discussed in Note 5. As of December 31, 2022 , the digital assets included in the Fund’s portfolio were: Bitcoin (“BTC”), Ethereum (“ETH”), Solana (“SOL”), Cardano (“ADA”), Avalanche (“AVAX”), and Polygon (“MATIC”) (collectively, the “Fund Components”). On a quarterly basis beginning on the second business day of January, April, July and October of each year, the Manager performs an analysis and may rebalance the Fund’s portfolio based on these results in accordance with policies and procedures as set forth in the Fund’s Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”). The Fund is authorized under the LLC Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of equal, fractional, undivided interests in the profits, losses, distributions, capital and assets of, and ownership of, the Fund (“Shares”) (in minimum baskets of
100
Shares, referred to as “Baskets”) in connection with creations. The redemption of Shares is not currently contemplated and the Fund does not currently operate a redemption program. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Manager in its sole discretion, the Fund may in the future operate a redemption program. The Fund currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program. The Fund’s investment objective is to hold the top digital assets by market capitalization and for the value of the Shares to reflect the value of such Fund Components at any given time, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities.
From time to time, the Fund may hold cash in U.S. dollars and positions in digital assets as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar event through which the Fund becomes entitled to another digital asset or other property by virtue of its ownership of one or more of the digital assets it then holds (each such new asset, a “Forked Asset”).
Grayscale Investments, LLC (“Grayscale” or the “Manager”) acts as the Manager of the Fund and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. (“DCG”). The Manager is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Fund pursuant to the provisions of the LLC Agreement. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing annual and quarterly reports on behalf of the Fund to investors and is also responsible for selecting and monitoring the Fund’s service providers. As partial consideration for the Manager’s services, the Fund pays Grayscale a Manager’s Fee as discussed in Note 8. The Manager also acts as the sponsor and manager of other investment products including Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust (BAT) (OTCQB: GBAT), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTCQX: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Chainlink Trust (LINK) (OTCQB: GLNK), Grayscale Decentraland Trust (MANA) (OTCQX: MANA), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (OTCQX: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), Grayscale Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTCQB: FILG), Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (OTCQX: HZEN), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC) (OTCQX: LTCN), Grayscale Livepeer Trust (LPT) (OTCQB: GLIV), Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL), Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM), Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZEC) (OTCQX: ZCSH), Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund LLC (OTCQB: DEFG), and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex Ethereum (ETH) Fund LLC, each of which is an affiliate of the Fund. The following investment products sponsored or managed by the Manager are also SEC reporting companies with their shares registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC), Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC), Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM), and Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZEC). Grayscale Advisors, LLC, a Registered Investment Advisor and an affiliate of the Manager, is the advisor to the Grayscale Future of Finance (NYSE: GFOF) product. Authorized Participants of the Fund are the only entities who may place orders to create or, if permitted, redeem Baskets. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (“Genesis” or, in such capacity, an “Authorized Participant”), a registered broker dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, was the only Authorized Participant prior to October 3, 2022, and was party to a participant agreement with the Manager and the Fund. Effective October 3, 2022, Grayscale Securities, LLC (“Grayscale Securities” or, in such capacity, an “Authorized Participant”), a registered broker-dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of the Manager, is the only Authorized Participant, and is party to a participant agreement with the Manager and the Fund. As a result, since October 3, 2022, Genesis has no longer acted as an Authorized Participant of the Fund, but serves as a Liquidity Provider to Grayscale Securities. Additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Manager. The Authorized Participant(s) may engage additional Liquitiy Providers at any time.
The custodian of the Fund is Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the “Custodian”), a third-party service provider. The Custodian is responsible for safeguarding the Fund Components and Forked Assets held by the Fund, and holding the private key(s) that provide access to the Fund’s digital wallets and vaults.
8
The transfer agent for the Fund (the “Transfer Agent”) is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The responsibilities of the Transfer Agent are to maintain creations, redemptions, transfers, and distributions of the Fund’s Shares which are primarily held in book-entry form.
On October 14, 2019, the Fund received notice that its Shares were qualified for public trading on the OTCQX U.S. Marketplace of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTCQX”). The Fund’s trading symbol on OTCQX is “GDLC” and the CUSIP number for its Shares is G40705108. The Fund’s previous trading symbol was “GDLCF” on OTCQX and was changed to “GDLC” on April 14, 2020.
On July 21, 2020, the Fund registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (reference number: 1688783). The Fund is registered and regulated as a private fund under the Private Funds Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the “Private Funds Act”).
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies In the opinion of management of the Manager of the Fund, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 and results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been made. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the full year. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Fund’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund:
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Fund qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946,
Financial Services—Investment Companies . The Fund uses fair value as its method of accounting for digital assets in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Fund is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.
The Fund conducts its transactions in Fund Components, including receiving Fund Components for the creation of Shares and delivering Fund Components for the redemption of Shares and for the payment of the Manager’s Fee. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Since its inception, the Fund has not held cash or cash equivalents.
Principal Market and Fair Value Determination
To determine which market is the Fund’s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”), the Fund follows ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for each Fund Component in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Fund to assume that each Fund Component is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. The Fund only receives Fund Components in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or its Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Fund looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Fund, through its Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant(s), may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets, each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, “Digital Asset Markets”). In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Fund’s principal market, the Fund reviews these criteria in the following order: First, the Fund reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that follow anti-money laundering (“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) procedures, and non-Digital Asset Exchange Markets that the Fund or Authorized Participant(s) reasonably believe are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. Second, the Fund sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of each Fund Component traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months.
9
Third, the Fund then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market.
Fourth, the Fund then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Fund, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the Fund Components. The Fund therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market for each Fund Component. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component.
The Fund determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Fund has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Fund’s determination of its principal market.
The cost basis of each Fund Component received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Fund at the fair value of such Fund Component at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Fund may differ from proceeds collected by an Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.
Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition
The Fund considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Fund Components for Share creations and the delivery of Fund Components for Share redemptions, the payment of expenses in Fund Components or the sale of Fund Components when the Manager rebalances the Fund’s portfolio. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Fund records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Manager’s Fee and selling Fund Component(s) when the Manager rebalances the Fund’s portfolio.
Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the ‘exit price’) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
GAAP utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Fund. Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
• Level 1—Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment.
• Level 2—Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3—Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment. To the extent that valuations are based on sources that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the Fund.

4. Distributions When a proposed modification to the Ethereum Network is accepted by the vast majority of validators, miners and users but is nonetheless not accepted by an other than insignificant population of participants in the network, a “fork” in the blockchain occurs, resulting in two separate Ethereum Networks. Holders of ETH on the original Ethereum Network, at the time the block is mined and the fork occurs, may also receive an identical amount of new tokens on the new network. Ethereum Fork on September 15, 2022 (ETHPoW) Background and Measurement The Ethereum Network completed the final stages of an upgrade referred to as the “Merge,” on September 15, 2022, and the Ethereum Network transitioned to a proof-of-stake model. Following the Merge, a hard fork of the Ethereum Network occurred, as certain ETH miners and network participants planned to maintain the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that was removed as part of the Merge. This version of the Ethereum Network was rebranded as Ethereum Proof-of-Work.
Immediately following the hard fork on September 15, 2022, holders of ETH passively received rights to an equal number of Ethereum Proof-of-Work tokens (“ETHPoW”) (referred to as a “right to the Forked Asset”). At that time, the Fund held approximately
40,653
ETH and the newly created ETHPoW was inaccessible to the Fund. On the date of the hard fork, the rights to the Forked Asset were determined to have no value as there were insufficient observable market inputs to determine the fair value of ETHPoW and the ETHPoW assets were not supported by the Custodian. Furthermore, on September 16, 2022, the Manager of the Fund announced that it had declared a distribution and established a record date for the distribution of the rights to the Forked Asset to the shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 26, 2022 (“Record Date Shareholders”). Subsequent Measurement and Distribution of Rights to ETHPoW On September 26, 2022 (the “Record Date”), the Fund distributed the rights to the Forked Asset to obtain approximately
40,653
ETHPoW tokens held by the Fund to the Record Date Shareholders as of the close of business on September 26, 2022. The right to acquire, or otherwise establish dominion and control over, any ETHPoW as a result of the aforementioned fork in the Ethereum blockchain is referred to as a “right to the Forked Asset” and any such ETHPoW acquired through such a right to the Forked Asset is referred to as the “Forked Asset.” On the Record Date, the Fund, acting on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders and pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement governing the Fund, appointed Grayscale Investments, LLC as agent (in this capacity, the “Agent”) on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders and transferred the rights to the Forked Assets held by the Fund to the Agent on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders. The Fund has no ownership interest in the distributed rights to the Forked Assets, no ability to control the actions of the Agent and no right to receive any information about the rights to the Forked Assets or the disposition thereof or of the underlying Forked Assets from the Record Date Shareholders, their Agent or any other person. As of the Record Date, the Fund determined such rights to the Forked Assets to have a fair value of $ 0
and
no
gain or loss was recognized as part of the rights to the Forked Assets distribution, due to the lack of a trading venue accessible to the Authorized Participant of the Fund and uncertainty regarding the ability to safely access and custody the ETHPoW.

5 . Portfolio Rebalancing
From inception through June 30, 2022, the Fund sought to hold digital assets with market capitalizations that collectively constituted at least
70 % of the market capitalization of the entire digital asset market (the “Target Coverage Ratio”) and determined the Fund Components by reference to fund construction criteria that consisted of market capitalization, liquidity and coverage criteria established by the Manager (the “Target Coverage Ratio Methodology”). Through the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology, the Fund sought to (i) provide large-cap coverage of the digital asset market; (ii) minimize transaction costs through low turnover of the Fund’s portfolio; and (iii) create a portfolio that could be replicated through direct purchases in the Digital Asset Market.
Effective July 1, 2022, the Manager replaced the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology as the fund construction criteria and no longer seeks to hold Fund Components meeting the Target Coverage Ratio. Instead, the Fund Components consist of the digital assets that make up the DLCS, as rebalanced from time to time, subject to the Manager’s discretion to exclude individual digital assets in certain cases. The DLCS is designed and managed by the Index Provider, a subsidiary of DCG and an affiliate of the Manager, which is also a subsidiary of DCG. The process followed by the Index Provider to determine the digital assets included in the DLCS and their respective weightings in the DLCS is referred to as the “DLCS Methodology.”
Effective July 1, 2022, the Index Provider reviews the DLCS for rebalancing according to the DLCS Methodology quarterly during a period beginning 14 days before the end of each March, June, September and December (each such period, an “Index Rebalancing Period”). At the start of each Index Rebalancing Period, the Index Provider applies the DLCS Methodology to determine any changes to the Index Components and the Index Weightings, after which the Manager rebalances the Fund’s portfolio accordingly, subject to application of the Exclusion Criteria. In order to rebalance the Fund’s portfolio, the Manager will (i) determine whether any Fund Components have been removed from the DLCS and should therefore be removed as Fund Components, (ii) determine whether any new digital assets have been added to the DLCS and should therefore be included as Fund Components, and (iii) determine how much cash and Forked Assets the Fund holds. If a Fund Component is no longer included in the DLCS, the Manager will adjust the Fund’s portfolio by selling such Fund Component in the Digital Asset Markets in proportion to their respective weightings in the Fund (“Weightings”) and using the cash proceeds to purchase additional tokens of the remaining Fund Components and, if applicable, any new Fund Component in proportion to their respective Weightings. The Weightings of each Fund Component are generally expected to be the same as the weighting of each digital asset in the DLCS except when the Manager determines to exclude one or more digital assets included in the DLCS from the Fund Components. If a digital asset not then included in the Fund’s portfolio is newly eligible for inclusion in the Fund’s portfolio because it was added to the DLCS and not excluded through the Exclusion Criteria, the Manager will adjust the Fund’s portfolio by selling tokens of the then-current Fund Components in the Digital Asset Markets in proportion to their respective Weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase tokens of the newly eligible digital assets.
The Manager will rebalance the Fund’s portfolio quarterly during a period beginning on the second business day of each January, April, July and October (each such period, a “Fund Rebalancing Period”). The Manager expects each Fund Rebalancing Period to last between
one
and
five
business days. The DLCS, and therefore the Fund, may also be rebalanced mid-quarter, prior to the Index Rebalancing Period under extraordinary circumstances, if, for example, a digital asset is removed from the Index.
On April 6, 2021, the Manager of the Fund announced the updated Fund Component weightings for the Fund in connection with its quarterly review. Effective April 2, 2021, the Manager adjusted the Fund’s portfolio by selling the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase LINK in accordance with the Fund’s construction criteria. On April 2, 2021, the Fund recognized a realized gain of $ 4,398,884

On October 4, 2022, the Index Provider completed the quarterly rebalancing of the DLCS and determined that BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, MATIC and AVAX met the inclusion criteria of the DLCS Index. On October 4, 2022 following the rebalancing of the Index, the Manager completed its quarterly review of the Fund’s portfolio and initiated the process of rebalancing the Fund. The Manager adjusted the Fund’s portfolio by selling the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective Weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase SOL, AVAX and MATIC. As a result, MATIC was added to the Fund. No tokens were removed from the Fund. On October 5, 2022, following the rebalancing, the Fund recognized a realized gain of $ 1,133,040

6 . Creations and Redemptions of Shares
At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were an unlimited number of Shares authorized by the Fund. The Fund creates (and, should the Fund commence a redemption program, redeems) Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets on behalf of investors are made by the Authorized Participant in exchange for the delivery of tokens of each Fund Component to the Fund, or the distribution of tokens of each Fund Component by the Fund, plus cash representing the Forked Asset portion, if any, and the U.S. Dollar portion, if any. The number of tokens of each Fund Component required for each creation Basket or redemption Basket is determined by dividing (x) the total number of tokens of such Fund Component held by the Fund at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date of a creation or redemption order, after deducting the number of tokens of each Fund Component payable as the Manager’s Fee and the number of tokens of such Fund Component payable as a portion of Additional Fund Expenses (as defined in Note 7), by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by 100. Each Share represented approximately
0.0004
of one BTC,
0.0025
of one ETH,
0.7041
of one ADA,
0.0073
of one SOL,
0.0061
of one AVAX and
0.1804
of one MATIC at December 31, 2022. Each Share represented approximately
0.0004
of one BTC,
0.0025
of one ETH,
0.6880
of one ADA,
0.0070
of one SOL,
0.0207
of one DOT,
0.0056
of one AVAX,
0.0015
of one LTC,
0.0147
of one UNI,
0.0100
of one LINK, and
0.0004
of one BCH at June 30, 2022.
The cost basis of investments in each Fund Component recorded by the Fund is the fair value of each Fund Component, as determined by the Fund, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Fund by the Authorized Participant based on the creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Fund may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and, if permitted, redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or each Fund Component. In addition, the Authorized Participant may realize significant profits through the sale of digital assets during a Fund Rebalancing Period.
At this time, the Fund is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Manager in its sole discretion, the Fund may in the future operate a redemption program. The Fund currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program. Further, the Fund is registered and regulated as a private fund under the Private Funds Act. The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority has supervisory and enforcement powers to ensure the Fund’s compliance with the Private Funds Act. Before the Fund is able to effect open redemptions as an open-ended Fund, it will be required to meet the requirements of, and register with, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and be regulated as a mutual fund under the Mutual Funds Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands .
7. Income Taxes The Government of the Cayman Islands does not, and will not, under existing Cayman law, impose any income, corporate or capital gains tax, estate duty, inheritance tax, gift tax or withholding tax upon the Fund or the shareholders. Interest, dividends and gains payable to the Fund and all distributions by the Fund to shareholders will be received free of any Cayman Islands income or withholding taxes.
The
Fund has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Manager believes that the Fund will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and thus will not derive income that is treated as “effectively connected”
17
with
the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (“effectively connected income”) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and corresponding tax regulations (e.g., including under Sections 861 through 865). There can, however, be no complete assurance in this regard. If the Fund were treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, at the rates applicable to U.S. corporations (currently, at the rate of
21 %), on its net effectively connected income. Any such income might also be subject to U.S. state and local income taxes. In addition, the Fund would be subject to a 30% U.S. branch profits tax in respect of its “dividend equivalent amount,” as defined in Section 884 of the Code, attributable to its effectively connected income (generally, the after-tax amount of certain effectively connected income that is not treated as reinvested in the trade or business).
If the Fund were treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States during any taxable year, it would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for that year, regardless of whether it recognized any effectively connected income. If the Fund did not file U.S. federal income tax returns and were later determined to have engaged in a U.S. trade or business, it would generally not be entitled to offset its effectively connected income and gains against its effectively connected losses and deductions (and, therefore, would be taxable on its gross, rather than net, effectively connected income). If the Fund recognizes any effectively connected income, the imposition of U.S. taxes on such income may have a substantial adverse effect on the return to shareholders.
Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and a general absence of clearly controlling authority with respect to digital assets, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets (including with respect to the amount, timing, and character of income recognition) are uncertain. The Manager believes that, in general, gains and losses recognized by the Fund from the sale or other disposition of digital assets will be treated as capital gains or losses. However, it is possible that the IRS will not agree with the Fund’s U.S. federal tax treatment of digital assets.
In accordance with GAAP, the Fund has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax positions in the financial statements as “more-likely than-not” to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the “more-likely than-not” threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the “more-likely than-not” threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of and during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Manager’s conclusions concerning its determination of “more likely than not” tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.
The Manager of the Fund has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022 .
8. Related Parties
The Fund considers the following entities, their directors and certain employees to be related parties of the Fund: DCG, Genesis, Grayscale,
Grayscale Securities and CoinDesk Indices, Inc. As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
1,370,846
Shares of the Fund were held by related parties of the Fund.
The Manager’s parent, an affiliate of the Fund, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than
1.0 % of Coinbase, Inc.’s ownership.
In accordance with the LLC Agreement governing the Fund, the Fund pays a fee to the Manager, calculated as
2.5 % of the aggregate value of the Fund’s digital asset holdings, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Manager or its delegates (the “Manager’s Fee”). The Manager’s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in Fund Components then held by the Fund in proportion to their respective Fund Component’s Weighting. The U.S. dollar amount of the Manager’s Fee will be converted into Fund Components on a daily basis by multiplying such U.S. dollar amount by the Weighing for each Fund Component and dividing the resulting product for each Fund Component by the U.S. dollar value for such Fund Component on such day. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of Fund Components is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Exchange Market that the Fund considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date.
No
Forked Assets have been distributed in payment of the Manager’s Fee during the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
As partial consideration for receipt of the Manager’s Fee, the Manager shall assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Fund in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fee, the administrator fee, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any Secondary Market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to $ 600,000
in
any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares
18
under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and fees relating to registration and any other regulatory requirements in the Cayman Islands; printing and mailing costs; costs of maintaining the Fund’s website and applicable license fees (together, the “Manager-paid Expenses”).
The Fund may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Manager-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Manager (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Fund to protect the Fund or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Forked Assets), any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Fund, the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) to the extent exceeding $ 600,000
in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively, “Additional Fund Expenses”). In such circumstances, the Manager or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the digital asset accounts Fund Components in proportion to their respective Weightings at such time and in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Fund Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Fund (or its delegate) to convert such Fund Components into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the price per single unit of such asset (determined net of any associated fees) at which the Fund is able to sell such asset or (y) when the Manager incurs such expenses on behalf of the Fund, cause the Fund (or its delegate) to deliver such Fund Components, and/or Forked Assets in kind to the Manager in satisfaction of such Additional Fund Expenses.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Fund incurred Manager’s Fees of
$ 1,108,018
and
$ 3,760,774 , respectively. For six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Fund incurred Manager’s Fees of
$ 2,429,296
and
$ 6,593,989 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 , there were
no
accrued and unpaid Manager’s Fees. In addition, the Manager may pay Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund, which are reimbursable by the Fund to the Manager. For the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Manager did
no t pay any Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund.
On March 2, 2022, the board of the Manager approved the purchase by DCG, the parent company of the Manager, of up to an aggregate total of $ 200
million worth of Shares of the Fund and shares of any of the following five investment products the Manager also acts as the sponsor and manager of, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTCQX: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (OTCQX: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), and Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM). Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. The Share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any specific number of Shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. From March 2, 2022 through
December 31, 2022 , DCG did not purchase any Shares of the Fund under this authorization.
9. Risks and Uncertainties The Fund is subject to various risks including market risk, liquidity risk, and other risks related to its concentration in digital assets. Investing in digital assets is currently highly speculative and volatile.
The net asset value of the Fund relates primarily to the value of the Fund Components, and fluctuations in the prices of such Fund Components could materially and adversely affect an investment in the Shares of the Fund. The prices of the Fund Components have a very limited history. During such history, the market prices of such Fund Components have been volatile, and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity. If the Digital Asset Markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations, the Fund may experience losses. Several factors may affect the market price of the Fund Components, including, but not limited to, global supply and demand of such Fund Components, theft of such Fund Components from global exchanges or vaults, competition from other forms of digital assets or payments services, global or regional political, economic or financial conditions, and other unforeseen market events and situations.
The digital asset networks relevant to the Fund Components are decentralized to an extent, meaning no single entity owns or operates them. Some digital asset networks, such as the BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, AVAX, and MATIC networks, are collectively maintained by a decentralized user base.
The Fund Components are commingled, and the Fund’s shareholders have no specific rights to any specific Fund Component. In the event of the insolvency of the Fund, its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders.
There is currently no clearing house for the Fund Components, nor is there a central or major depository for the custody of such Fund Components. There is a risk that some or all of the Fund Components could be lost or stolen. There can be no assurance that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to the Fund Components. Further, transactions in the Fund Components are irrevocable. Stolen or incorrectly transferred Fund Components may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed Fund Component transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.
19
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has stated that certain digital assets may be considered “securities” under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a “security” is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities. Further, Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple”), the company that retains a key role in stewarding the development of XRP, is currently a defendant in a federal class-action lawsuit filed by certain XRP holders that alleges that XRP is a security issued by Ripple. In addition, in 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the issuer of XRP, Ripple Labs, Inc., and two of its executives, alleging that they raised more than $ 1.3
billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. If a Fund Component is determined to be a “security” under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for such Fund Component. For example, it may become more difficult for such Fund Component to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other digital assets that are not considered to be securities, which could in turn negatively affect the liquidity and general acceptance of such Fund Component and cause users to migrate to other digital assets. As such, any determination that a Fund Component is a security under federal or state securities laws may adversely affect the value of such Fund Component and, as a result, an investment in the Shares.
To the extent that a Fund Component is determined to be a security, the Fund and the Manager may also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Manager may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. If the Manager determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Manager will terminate the Fund. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Fund’s digital assets at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.
As with any computer network, digital asset networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks and disruptions. For example, each digital asset network of the Fund Components, for which it is relevant, is vulnerable to a “51% attack” where, if a malicious actor were to gain control of more than 50% of a network’s hash rate, it would be able to gain full control of the network and the ability to manipulate the relevant blockchains on which the respective Fund Components settle. In May 2019, the Bitcoin Cash network experienced a 51% attack when two mining pools combined their hash rates to reverse a block of transactions that rewarded tokens to an unknown actor who had taken advantage of an unrelated vulnerability in the Bitcoin Cash network. The Fund did not suffer any direct losses as a result of the attack. Although this particular attack could be interpreted as reversing a separate attack on the Bitcoin Cash network, the Bitcoin Cash network may be vulnerable to future 51% attacks that could result in a loss of confidence in the Bitcoin Cash network.
Additionally, as an example of a network disruption, the Solana network experienced a significant disruption on September 14, 2021, later attributed to a type of denial of service attack, and was offline for 17 hours, only returning to full functionality 24 hours later. While persons associated with Solana Labs and/or the Solana Foundation are understood to have played a key role in bringing the network back online, the broader community also played a key role, as Solana validators coordinated to upgrade and restart the network. Furthermore, like any smart contract platform that utilizes bridge technology, digital assets transferred to or from other blockchains are vulnerable to certain types of exploits. For example, on February 3, 2022, hackers were able to manipulate the Wormhole bridge smart contract code which enables the transfer of certain digital assets to the Solana Network, to divert approximately
120,000
Ethereum from the Wormhole bridge to the attacker’s Ethereum wallet. While Jump Crypto, the creators of the Wormhole bridge, replenished the stolen ETH, effectively backstopping user losses, they or other creators may not be able to do so again in the future. The development of bridges on digital asset networks is ongoing and further attacks on bridges compatible with a digital asset network of a Fund Component could have a material adverse effect on the value of such Fund Component and an investment in the Shares. To the extent a private key required to access a Fund Component address is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the Fund may be unable to access the relevant Fund Component controlled by the private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the network of such Fund Component. The processes by which the Fund Component transactions are settled are dependent on the peer-to-peer network of such Fund Component, and as such, the Fund is subject to operational risk. A risk also exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of the Fund Component.
The Fund relies on third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to its operations. Any disruptions to the Fund’s service providers’ business operations, resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Fund.

Ratios of net investment loss and expenses to average net assets have been annualized. An individual shareholder’s return, ratios, and per Share performance may vary from those presented above based on the timing of Share transactions. Total return is calculated assuming an initial investment made at the net asset value at the beginning of the period and assuming redemption on the last day of the period. The amount shown for a Share outstanding throughout the period may not correlate with the Statement of Operations for the period due to the number of Shares issued in Creations occurring at an operational value derived from an operating metric as defined in the LLC Agreement.
11. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into certain contracts that provide a variety of indemnities, including contracts with the Manager and affiliates of the Manager, DCG and its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, and the Custodian as well as others relating to services provided to the Fund. The Fund’s maximum exposure under these and its other indemnities is unknown. However, no liabilities have arisen under these indemnities in the past and, while there can be no assurances in this regard, there is no expectation that any will occur in the future. Therefore, the Manager does not consider it necessary to record a liability in this regard.
12. Subsequent Events On January 4, 2023, the Index Provider completed the quarterly rebalancing of the DLCS and determined that BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and MATIC met the inclusion criteria of the DLCS Index. On January 4, 2023, following the rebalancing of the Index, the Manager completed its quarterly review of the Fund’s portfolio and initiated the process of rebalancing the Fund. The Manager adjusted the Fund’s portfolio by selling AVAX and using the cash proceeds to purchase the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective Weightings. As a result, AVAX has been removed from the Fund. No new tokens were added from the Fund. As of January 5, 2023, following the rebalancing, the Fund Components consisted of
65.02 % BTC,
30.73 % ETH,
1.86 % ADA,
1.39 % MATIC, and

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report, or in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” or other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Fund Overview
The Fund is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Manager and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Fund holds Fund Components and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Fund Components. As a passive investment vehicle, the Fund’s investment objective is for the value of the Shares to reflect the value of the Fund Components held by the Fund, determined by reference to the Digital Asset Reference Rates and weightings within the Fund, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities, but have instead traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Fund is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle.
Prior to July 1, 2022, the Fund determined which Fund Components to hold pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology. Effective July 1, 2022, the Manager replaced the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology as the fund construction criteria and adopted the DLCS Methodology. Prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components were Index Prices or Old Indicative Prices. In connection with the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Manager changed the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components and as of the date of this Quarterly Report, each of the Digital Asset Reference Rates are Indicative Prices.

Ethereum Fork on September 15, 2022 (ETHPoW)
Background and Measurement
A “hard fork” of a Digital Asset Network occurs when there is a disagreement among users and validators or miners over modifications to a Digital Asset Network, which are typically made through software upgrades and subsequently accepted or rejected through downloads or lack thereof of the relevant software upgrade by users. If less than a substantial majority of users and validators or miners consent to a proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, a fork in the blockchain results, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork is the existence of two versions of the relevant Digital Asset Network running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability. After a fork, holders of the original digital asset typically end up holding equal amounts of the original digital asset and the new digital asset.
The Ethereum Network completed the final stages of an upgrade referred to as the “Merge,” on September 15, 2022, and the Ethereum Network transitioned to a proof-of-stake model. Following the Merge, a hard fork of the Ethereum Network occurred, as certain ETH miners and network participants planned to maintain the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that was removed as part of the Merge. This version of the Ethereum Network was rebranded as Ethereum Proof-of-Work.
Immediately following the hard fork on September 15, 2022, holders of ETH passively received rights to an equal number of ETHPoW (referred to as a “right to the Forked Asset”). At that time, the Fund held approximately 40,653 ETH and the newly created ETHPoW was inaccessible to the Fund. On the date of the hard fork, the rights to the Forked Asset were determined to have no value as there were insufficient observable market inputs to determine the fair value of ETHPoW and the ETHPoW assets were not supported by the Custodian.
22
Furthermore, on September 16, 2022, the Manager of the Fund announced that it had declared a distribution and established a record date for the distribution of the rights to the Forked Asset to the shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 26, 2022 (“Record Date Shareholders”).
Subsequent Measurement and Distribution of Rights to ETHPoW
On September 26, 2022 (the “Record Date”), the Fund distributed the rights to the Forked Asset to obtain approximately 40,653 ETHPoW tokens held by the Fund to the Record Date Shareholders as of the close of business on the Record Date. The right to acquire, or otherwise establish dominion and control over, any ETHPoW as a result of the aforementioned fork in the Ethereum blockchain is referred to as a “right to the Forked Asset” and any such ETHPoW acquired through such a right to the Forked Asset is referred to as the “Forked Asset.”
On the Record Date, the Fund, acting on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders and pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement governing the Fund, appointed Grayscale Investments, LLC as agent (in this capacity, the “Agent”) on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders and transferred the rights to the Forked Assets held by the Fund to the Agent on behalf of the Record Date Shareholders. The Fund has no ownership interest in the distributed rights to the Forked Assets, no ability to control the actions of the Agent and no right to receive any information about the rights to the Forked Assets or the disposition thereof or of the underlying Forked Asset from the Record Date Shareholders, the Agent or any other person. As of the Record Date, the Fund determined such rights to the Forked Assets to have a fair value of $0 and no gain or loss was recognized as part of the rights to the Forked Assets distribution, due to the lack of a trading venue accessible to the Authorized Participant of the Fund and uncertainty regarding the ability to safely access and custody the ETHPoW.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition
The Fund considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Fund Components for Share creations and the delivery of Fund Components for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in Fund Components. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Fund records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Manager’s Fee in the Fund Components.
Principal Market and Fair Value Determination
To determine which market is the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”), the Fund follows FASB ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for each Fund Component in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Fund to assume that each Fund Component is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.
Effective October 3, 2022, the Manager entered into a Participant Agreement with Grayscale Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Manager and an affiliate and related party of the Fund, pursuant to which Grayscale Securities has agreed to act as an Authorized Participant of the Fund. The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation of Shares of the Fund through the Authorized Participant, which are substantially similar to the procedures for the creation of Shares set forth in the Fund’s
prior participant agreement with Genesis, except that the Authorized Participant may engage a Liquidity Provider to source Fund Components on behalf of the Authorized Participant in connection with the creation of Shares. Since October 3, 2022, Grayscale Securities is the only acting Authorized Participant of the Fund. Grayscale Securities has engaged Genesis as a Liquidity Provider. Additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Manager.
The Fund only receives Fund Components in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or its Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Fund looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Fund, through its Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant(s), may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets, each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary. In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component, the Fund reviews these criteria in the following order:
• First, the Fund reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that follow anti-money laundering (“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) procedures, and non-Digital Asset Exchange Markets that the Fund or Authorized Participant(s) reasonably
23
believe are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market.
• Second, the Fund sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and activity of each Fund Component traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months.
• Third, the Fund then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market.
• Fourth, the Fund then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market for such Fund Component based on the highest market volume, activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Fund, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the Fund Components. The Fund therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market for each Fund Component. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component.
The Fund determines its principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Fund has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Fund’s determination of its principal market for each Fund Component.
The cost basis of each Fund Component received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Fund at the fair value of such Fund Component at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Fund may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.
Investment Company Considerations
The Fund is an investment company for GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946,
Financial Services —Investment Companies . The Fund uses fair value as its method of accounting for digital assets in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Fund is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

Net assets decreased to $158,755 at December 31, 2022, a 9% decrease for the six month period. The decrease in net assets primarily resulted from the decrease in the price of BTC, as well as certain other Fund Components, and from the withdrawal of approximately 80 BTC, 509 ETH, 1,455 SOL, 96 UNI, 3 BCH, 10 LTC, 65 LINK, 141,864 ADA, 1,202 AVAX, 135 DOT, and 17,305 MATIC to pay the foregoing Manager’s Fee for the period ended December 31, 2022.
Net realized and unrealized gain on investments in digital assets for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $135,298, which includes a realized gain of $4,938 on the transfer of digital assets to pay the Manager’s Fee, a realized gain of $26,632 as a result of the quarterly rebalance of digital assets, and net change in unrealized appreciation on investments in digital assets of $103,728. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $128,704 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized gain on investments in digital assets, less the Manager’s Fee of $6,594. Net assets increased to $496,947 at December 31, 2021, a 35% increase for the six month period. The increase in net assets resulted from the contribution of approximately 13 BTC, 77 ETH, 13 BCH, 47 LTC, 310 LINK and 20,953 ADA, with a total value of $935 to the Fund in connection with Share creations during the period, partially offset by the withdrawal of approximately 86 BTC, 519 ETH, 666 SOL, 143,630 ADA, 1,340 UNI, 311 LTC, 2,062 LINK and 90 BCH to pay the foregoing Manager’s Fee.
Cash Resources and Liquidity
The Fund has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling Fund Components and/or Forked Assets to pay Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund, the Manager endeavors to sell the exact number of Fund Components and/or Forked Assets needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Fund’s holdings of assets other than the Fund Components. As a consequence, the Manager expects that the Fund will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Fund is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.
In exchange for the Manager’s Fee, the Manager has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Fund. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Fund during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report was the Manager’s Fee. The Fund is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

The Fund currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.

Historical Fund Component Prices
As movements in the price of each Fund Component will directly affect the price of the Shares, investors should understand recent movements in the price of each Fund Component. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in each of the Fund Component prices are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world.
The following chart illustrates the movement in the Fund's Digital Asset Holdings per Share, based on the Digital Asset Reference Rate of each Fund Component, versus the Fund's net asset value per Share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP from February 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Prior to July 1, 2022, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share was calculated based on the Fund Components held by the Fund pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology and using Index Prices or Old Indicative Prices. Effective July 1, 2022, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share is calculated based on the Fund Components held by the Fund pursuant to the DLCS Methodology and using Indicative Prices. As a result, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share for periods subsequent to July 1, 2022 are not directly comparable to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share in periods prior to July 1, 2022.

Ri sk Factors
There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors last reported under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below.
Recent developments in the digital asset economy have led to extreme volatility and disruption in digital asset markets, a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem, significant negative publicity surrounding digital assets broadly and market-wide declines in liquidity.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, digital asset prices began falling precipitously. This has led to volatility and disruption in the digital asset markets and financial difficulties for several prominent industry participants, including digital asset exchanges, hedge funds and lending platforms. For example, in the first half of 2022, digital asset lenders Celsius Network LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. and digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital each declared bankruptcy. This resulted in a loss of confidence in participants in the digital asset ecosystem, negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly and market-wide declines in digital asset trading prices and liquidity.
Thereafter, in November 2022, FTX, the third largest Digital Asset Exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals amid rumors of the company’s liquidity issues and likely insolvency. Shortly thereafter, FTX’s CEO resigned and FTX and several affiliates of FTX filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently brought criminal charges, including charges of fraud, violations of federal securities laws, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses, against FTX’s former CEO and others. FTX is also under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as by various regulatory authorities in the Bahamas, Europe and other jurisdictions. In response to these events, the digital asset markets have experienced extreme price volatility and declines in liquidity, and regulatory and enforcement scrutiny has increased, including from the DOJ, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress. In addition, several other entities in the digital asset industry filed for bankruptcy following FTX’s bankruptcy filing, such as BlockFi Inc. and Genesis Global Holdco, LLC (“Genesis Holdco”), both of which are digital asset lenders. The SEC also brought charges against Genesis Global Capital, LLC, a subsidiary of Genesis Holdco, and Gemini Trust Company, LLC on January 12, 2023 for their alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors.
Genesis Holdco, together with certain of its subsidiaries, filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January 2023. While Genesis Holdco is not a service provider to the Fund, it is an affiliate of Genesis Global Trading, Inc., which acts as a Liquidity Provider to the Authorized Participant of the Fund, is a wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, and is an affiliate of the Fund and the Manager. The Liquidity Provider sources digital assets on behalf of the Authorized Participant in connection with the creation of Shares. As such, if Genesis Holdco’s bankruptcy, including the potential sale or transfer of the Liquidity Provider’s equity and/or assets as part of the bankruptcy negotiations, has a negative impact on the Liquidity Provider’s ability to act in such capacity, the Authorized Participant may be required to replace the Liquidity Provider, which could negatively impact the Fund’s ability to create new Shares.
These events have led to significant negative publicity around digital asset market participants including DCG, Genesis and DCG's other affiliated entities. This publicity could negatively impact the reputation of the Manager and have an adverse effect on the trading price and/or the value of the Shares. Moreover, sales of a significant number of Shares of the Fund as a result of these events could have a negative impact on the trading price of the Shares.
These events are continuing to develop at a rapid pace and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to the Manager, the Fund, their affiliates and/or the Fund’s third party service providers, or on the digital asset industry as a whole. Continued disruption and instability in the digital asset markets as these events develop, including further declines in the trading prices and liquidity of the Fund Components, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value.
37
The Fund relies on third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to the affairs of the Fund and the replacement of such service providers could pose a challenge to the safekeeping of the Fund’s digital assets and to the operations of the Fund.
The Fund relies on the Custodian, the Authorized Participant and other third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to managing the affairs of the Fund. In addition, the Authorized Participant relies on the Liquidity Provider to source the Fund Components in connection with the creation of Shares. Any disruptions to such service providers’ business operations, resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Fund and require the Manager to replace such service provider. Moreover, the Manager could decide to replace a service provider to the Fund, or the Authorized Participant may decide to replace the Liquidity Provider for other reasons.
If the Manager decides, or is required, to replace Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC as the custodian of the Fund’s digital assets, transferring maintenance responsibilities of the Digital Asset Account to another party will likely be complex and could subject the Fund’s digital assets to the risk of loss during the transfer, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Shares or result in loss of the Fund’s assets.
Moreover, the legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain. The Custody Agreement contains an agreement by the parties to treat the digital assets credited to the Fund’s Digital Asset Account as financial assets under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“Article 8”), in addition to stating that the Custodian will serve as fiduciary and custodian on the Fund’s behalf. The Custodian’s parent, Coinbase Global Inc., has stated in its most recent public securities filings that in light of the inclusion in its custody agreements of provisions relating to Article 8 it believes that a court would not treat custodied digital assets as part of its general estate in the event the Custodian were to experience insolvency. However, due to the novelty of digital asset custodial arrangements courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied digital assets and it is not possible to predict with certainty how they would rule in such a scenario. If the Custodian became subject to insolvency proceedings and a court were to rule that the custodied digital assets were part of the Custodian’s general estate and not the property of the Fund, then the Fund would be treated as a general unsecured creditor in the Custodian’s insolvency proceedings and the Fund would be subject to the loss of all or a significant portion of its assets.
To the extent that Manager is not able to find a suitable party willing to serve as the custodian, the Manager may be required to terminate the Fund and liquidate the Fund’s digital assets. In addition, to the extent that the Manager finds a suitable party and must enter into a modified Custodian Agreement that is less favorable for the Fund or Manager and/or transfer the Fund’s assets in a relatively short time period, the safekeeping of the Fund’s digital assets may be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect value of the Shares. Likewise, if the Manager and/or the Authorized Participant is required to replace any other service provider, they may not be able to find a party willing to serve in such capacity in a timely manner or at all. If the Manager decides, or is required, to replace the Authorized Participant and/or if the Authorized Participant decides, or is required, to replace the Liquidity Provider, this could negatively impact the Fund’s ability to create new Shares, which would impact the Shares’ liquidity and could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares.
