CAVITATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Note 1 -
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein,
unless otherwise indicated, as “the Company,” “CTi,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Nevada
corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. CTi has developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary technology
that may be used in liquid processing applications.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as promulgated in the United
States of America (“U.S.”) and with instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, these condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, we have included all adjustments considered necessary (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) for a
fair presentation. Operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not indicative of the results that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. You should read these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2022 filed on October 13, 2022. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial
statements included in the Form 10-K for that year.
Going Concern
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplates continuation of the Company
as a going concern. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss of $( 372,000 ), 372,000
used cash in operations
of $ ( 98,000 )
and at December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $( 373,000 ). These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in their
report on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
As of December, 31 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents
on hand of $ 343,000
and are not generating sufficient funds to cover operations. In addition to the cash on hand, management believes
we may require additional funds to continue to operate our business. Management's plan is to generate income from operations by continuing
to license our technology globally through our strategic partners, including the extension or renewal of our existing global R and D,
Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet), agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc (ABI), and agreement
with Enviro Watertek, LLC (EWT).
We may also attempt to raise additional debt and/or
equity financing to fund operations and provide additional working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing will be
consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet the Company's needs, that the Company will be able to achieve profitable
operations or that the Company will be able to meet its future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain such financing,
the Company may curtail its operations.
7
Covid-19
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company believes the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact its operating results due to the nature of the Company’s business
and its operations. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a significant change in the fair value of its assets
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results
of the outbreak and its effects on the Company’s business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has been
following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees, including the temporary closure
of its corporate office and having employees work remotely. Most vendors have transitioned to electronic submission of invoices and payments.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement
date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used in allowance for bad debts,
reserve for inventory obsolescence, impairment analysis for fixed assets, accrual of potential liabilities, deferred tax assets and valuing
our stock options, warrants, and common stock issued for services, among other items. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”).
Revenue from the sale of the Company’s Nano
Reactors is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities as this is our sole performance obligation under these
contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer.
Revenue from the Company’s share of gross
profit to be earned from distributors, as defined, which the Company treats as variable consideration, is recognized using the most likely
amount method. Estimates are available from our distributor which are considered in the determination of the most likely amount.
Revenue from usage fees is recognized by the Company
based on actual usage by the customer.
The Company provides a limited warranty with every
set of reactors sold, typically 2 to 5 years. The Company has not experienced significant claims under its warranty policy, and management
determined
no
accrual for warranty reserve was necessary at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
Equity Method Investment
The Company accounts for investments in entities
in which the Company has significant influence over the entity’s financial and operating policies, but does not control, using the
equity method of accounting. The equity method investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently increased for capital contributions
and allocations of net income, and decreased for capital distributions and allocations of net loss. Equity in net income (loss) from the
equity method investment is allocated based on the Company’s economic interest. The Company assesses its investment in equity method
investments for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, the Company writes
down the investment to its fair value.
8
Management reviews the equity method investment
for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and when circumstances indicate that
their carrying values may not be recoverable.
At December 31, 2022, management concluded that
there were no impairment indicators. If economic uncertainty increases and/or the global economy worsens, the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations may be sufficiently impacted to result in future impairment charges in the short-term.  Management
will continue to monitor the effects that macroeconomic conditions have on its business and operations, and will review impairment indicators
to the extent necessary in the upcoming months.
Loss Per Share
The Company’s computation of loss per share
(EPS) includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Shares of restricted stock subject to vesting are included in basic
weighted average common shares outstanding from the time they vest. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock
method that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted
in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net loss of the Company. In computing diluted EPS, the treasury stock method assumes
that outstanding options and warrants are exercised, and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price and
there were no instruments that would result in issuance of additional shares during the period.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
1,250,000
stock options and
53,927,834
stock warrants outstanding to purchase shares of common stock that were not included in the diluted net
loss per common share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Concentrations
Cash - cash is deposited in one financial institution.
The balances held at this financial institution at times may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
insurance limits of up to $250,000.
Accounts Receivable – accounts receivable
at June 30, 2022, were due from Desmet (see Note 2).
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses –
three vendors accounted for
41 %,
26 %, and
20 % of accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Three vendors
accounted for
32 %,
29 % and
24 % of accounts payable and accrued expenses as of June 30, 2022.
Revenues –
during the three and
six months periods ended December 31, 2022 were
100 % and
95 % of revenues, respectively, were from Desmet. Revenue during the three and six
months periods ended December 31, 2021 were
96 % and
99 % of revenues, respectively, were from Desmet.
Fair Value Measurement
FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
820-10 requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized
on the balance sheet for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as
the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
9
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
as follows:
·
Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
·
Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
·
Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
On December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the fair
values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying
values due to their short-term nature.
Segments
The Company operates in one segment, its nano
reactor technology business.  In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief
operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions
about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach
to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures
about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material
operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in:
economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company
operates in one segment, all financial information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU
2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses (“CECL”)
to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition
of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The Company
does not believe the potential impact of the new guidance and related codification improvements will be material to its financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated
financial statements.

Note 2 -
Contracts with Desmet Ballestra Group
In October 2021, the Company executed a three-year
agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet) that is a continuation of the October 2018 agreement for the sale of the Company’s
reactors. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of reactors at the time of shipment of the Nano reactor
hardware as shipment is deemed to be the Company’s only performance obligation and the Company had no more continuing obligation
other than the reactor’s two-year standard warranty. Desmet pays for such reactors on credit terms and the amount of a sale is recorded
as a receivable upon acceptance by Desmet. In addition, Desmet agreed to provide the Company monthly advances of $40,000 through October
1, 2024 to be applied against future sales of reactors.
This agreement replaced an earlier agreement which provided the Company a share of gross profit from the sale of the reactors and also
provided the Company monthly advances of $50,000 through October 1, 2021 that was applied against the Company’s gross profit share.
During the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded total revenue from Desmet of $ 58,000
and $ 303,000  from reactor sales, respectively.
During the three
and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded total revenue from Desmet of $ 109,000
and $ 660,000
from reactor sales, respectively.
As of June 30, 2022, outstanding balance of monthly
advances received from Desmet amounted to $ 80,000 . During the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company received advances in the aggregate
of $ 480,000
and applied a total of $ 303,000
to the sales of reactors. As of December, 31, 2022, outstanding balance of the advances amounted
to $ 257,000 .
Note 3 -
Investment in equity method investment
In 2019, the Company and Delaware Water Company,
LLC (Delaware) formed a limited liability company called Enviro WaterTek LLC (“Enviro”). Enviro is owned 50% by the Company
and 50% by Delaware, and the Company accounts for its investment in Enviro under the equity method. From 2019 to 2021, Enviro had no operations.
In September 2021, the Company and Delaware entered
into a separate agreement under Enviro for a specific project (referred to as “Ameredev”). Delaware has certain contracts
in place to provide recycled water to operators of certain active oil and gas wells. Under the agreement, the Company contributed $1.2
million that was used by Ameredev to increase the capacity of certain pipelines and water treatment facilities operated by Delaware. Pursuant
to the agreement, for each barrel of recycled water that Ameredev sells, Delaware will receive $0.10 per barrel, and the Company will
receive $0.05 per barrel (referred to as usage fees), with the balance of net income (loss) from Ameredev being allocated 70% to Delaware
and 30% to the Company. The Ameredev agreement will terminate the earlier of three years (unless extended by unanimous agreement of the
Board and Members of Ameredev) from the date of the agreement or by unanimous agreement of the Board and Members of Ameredev.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company recorded total revenues from Ameredev of $ 17,000  from usage fees. There was
no
usage fee recorded during the three months
ended December 31, 2022.
During the three and six months ended December
31, 2022, the Company recognized a loss of $ 11,000
and $ 29,000 , respectively, to account for the Company’s 30% share in the
net loss from the equity method investment.

Operating Lease
The Company leases certain warehouse and corporate
office space under operating lease agreement. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets are presented as operating
lease right-of-use assets and the related liabilities are presented as lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in lease arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes
its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a
hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments
made and excludes lease incentives.

Commitments and Contingencies
Royalty Agreements
On July 1, 2008, the Company entered into Patent
Assignment Agreements with two parties, our President and Technology Development Supervisor, where certain devices and methods involved
in the hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by the President and the Technology Development Supervisor have been assigned to the
Subsidiary. In exchange, the Subsidiary agreed to pay a royalty of 5% of gross revenues to each of the President and Technology Development
Supervisor for licensing of the technology and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently
assumed by Cavitation Technologies on May 13, 2010 from its subsidiary. The Company's President and Technology Development Supervisor
both waived their rights to receive royalty payments that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through December
31, 2018.
On April 30, 2008 and as amended on November 22,
2010, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into an employment agreement with our former Director of Chemical and Analytical Department
(the "Inventor") to receive an amount equal to 5% of actual gross royalties received from the royalty stream in the first year
in which the Company receives royalty payments from the patent which the Inventor was the legally named inventor, and 3% of actual gross
royalties received by the Company resulting from the patent in each subsequent year. As of December 31, 2022 no patents have been granted
in which this person is the legally named inventor.

developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary technology.
CTi has developed, patented, and commercialized
proprietary technology that can be used for processing of industrial fluids. CTi's patented
Nano Reactor®
is the critical components
of
the CTi Nano Neutralization®
System which is commercially proven to reduce operating costs and increase yields in processing
oils and fats. CTi has two issued patents relating to our Nano
Reactor®
systems and has filed several national and international
patents to employ its proprietary technology in applications including, vegetable oil refining, biodiesel production, waste water treatment,
algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement.
We are engaged in manufacturing our Nano-Reactors,
which are designed to help refine vegetable oils, biodiesel transesterification and treatment of produced and frack water. Our near-term
goal is to continue to sell our systems through our partners, Desmet Ballestra and EW.
During the past several years we have developed
a number of new applications utilizing the core principal of our technology. Our low pressure non-reactors (LPN) can be utilized in multiple
industries that process large volumes of fluids and we anticipate accelerated commercial sales in our fiscal 2020. Further, we have miniaturized
our non-reactors to be utilized in various consumer oriented products, such as, processing and enhancing spirits and wines, drinking water
with infusion of vitamins, minerals and cannabidiol (CBD) oil.
We have agreements to license our technology globally
through our strategic partners, Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet) and Enviro Watertek, LLC (EW) and Alchemy Beverages, Inc (ABI). Desmet
have been providing monthly advances of $50,000. We may need additional funding, and may attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity
financing to fund operations and additional working capital. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such
financing or obtained sufficient amounts necessary to meet our business needs, or that we will be able to meet our future contractual
obligations.
In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared
coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces,
customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.
This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our product and harm our business and results of operations. It is
not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business or results
of operations at this time.
17
Inflation
Global inflation also
increased during 2021 and in 2022. The Russia and Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as related international
response, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, including causing increases in the price for goods and services and global supply chain
disruptions, which have resulted and may continue to result in shortages in food products, materials and services. Such shortages have
resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, food products, materials and services, and could continue
to cause costs to increase as well as result in the scarcity of certain materials. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of
inflation or other negative economic factors or associated increases in our operating costs and how that may impact our business. To the
extent we and our customers we service are unable to recover higher operating costs resulting from inflation or otherwise mitigate the
impact of such costs on our and their business, our revenues and gross profit could decrease, and our financial condition and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

Revenue
The Company generates revenues from the sale of
the
Nano Reactor®
to customers/distributor as well as share in gross profit from the sale of such reactors by our distributors
to their customers. Additionally, the Company generates revenues from its equity method investment.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022
we recorded $303,000 in revenue compared to $660,000 for months ended December 31, 2021. Revenues decreased since the Company received
four purchase orders from Desmet in during the current period compared five purchase order in the prior period. In addition, the Company
also recognized usage fees of $4,000 during the prior period compared to $17,000 during the current period.
Cost of Revenue
During the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, our cost of sales amounted to $62,000 and $26,000 respectively during the same period in prior year, which was the result of
the revenue transactions described above.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 amounted to $598,000 compared with $852,000 for the same period in 2021, a decrease of $254,000 or 30%. Decrease in
general and administrative expense due to decrease in salary and professional expenses.
Research and development (R&D) expenses for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0 and $2,000, respectively. R&D expenses remained relatively low as we continued
to rely on Desmet and for support in R&D and development of new applications for our technology. It is our intention to pursue R&D
as our cash position permits.
Other income (expense)
Other income (expense) for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, amounted to $(32,000) and $101,000, respectively. The decrease in other income (expense) of $(132,000) was
the result of a $29,000 loss from an equity method investment in 2022, offset by a gain on forgiveness of PPP note payable of $104,000
in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resource
During the six months
ended December 31, 2022 the Company incurred a net loss of $372,000 and used cash from operations of $98,000 and had a working capital
deficit of $373,000 as of December 31, 2022. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s June 30, 2022 financial statements, has expressed substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2022
we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $343,000 and are not generating sufficient revenues to fund operations. In addition, management
believes we may require additional funds to continue to operate our business. Management's plan is to generate income from operations
by continuing to license our technology globally through our strategic partners, Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet), Enviro Watertek (EW)
and Alchemy Beverages, Inc. (ABI). Pursuant to our contract with Desmet, Desmet has been providing us monthly advances of $40,000 through
October 1, 2024 to be applied against from future reactor sales.
20
We may also attempt to
raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and provide additional working capital. However, there is no assurance
that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet the Company's needs, that the Company will
be able to achieve profitable operations or that the Company will be able to meet its future contractual obligations. Should management
fail to obtain such financing, the Company may curtail its operations.
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities during the
six months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $98,000 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $131,000 for the same
period in fiscal 2021. Funding for the operating activities was provided primarily by sales of our systems to Desmet, advances from distributor
and cash reserve.
Net cash used in investing
activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0 and $1,179,000 respectively. In 2021, the Company had a capital
contribution from an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
Net cash provided by
financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0 and $785,000, respectively. In 2021, the Company received
proceeds from the sale of common stock with warrants.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement
date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used for allowance for doubtful
accounts, reserve for inventory obsolescence, impairment analysis for property and equipment, accrual of potential liabilities, valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets, and assumption in valuing our stock options, warrants, and common stock issued for services, among
other items. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606.
Revenue from the sale of the Company’s Nano
Reactors is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities as this is our sole performance obligation under these
contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer.
The Company also recognized
revenue from its share of gross profit to be earned from distributors, as defined, which we treated as variable consideration and recognized
using the most likely amount method.
In addition, the Company
also recognizes revenues from usage fees of certain reactors. Usage fees are recognized based on actual usage by the customer.

rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) and (c), management
must also evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure control and procedures at the end of each fiscal year. As of September 30, 2022
