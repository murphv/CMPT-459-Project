NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2023, AND 2022   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   GPO Plus, Inc. (the “Company”) is a corporation originally established under the name of Koldeck, Inc. under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016.   On April 2, 2018, the Company changed our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. and merged with our wholly owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd.
On June 19, 2020, the Company changed our corporate name from Global House Holdings Ltd. to GPO Plus, Inc. and merged with our wholly owned subsidiary GPO Plus, Inc. Global House Holdings Ltd. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name GPO Plus, Inc   Effective May 5, 2020, Brett H. Pojunis acquired
5,000,000
(post-split) of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from Jian Han Chen. As a result of the transaction, Mr. Pojunis had voting and dispositive control over
53.67 % of our outstanding voting securities. Mr. Pojunis’s ownership has since been diluted to 21%, and Mr. Chen no longer holds any equity interest in the Company.
On June 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with DEV Distribution LLC, which appoints GPOX as a master distributor for the best-efforts sale of Branded Products, Bulk Products and White Label Products within a specific Territory.   We are a start-up company engaged in the business of organizing, promoting, and operating industry-specific group purchase organizations (GPOs). A GPO is an entity created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors.   NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN   The Company’s financial statements as of January 31, 2023, have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative deficit of $ 33,120,867 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.   In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2023. Notes to the unaudited interim financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2022 have been omitted. This report should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, included in the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 14, 2022.     8 Table of Contents   Use of Estimates   Preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.   Reclassifications   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The reclassification had no impact on net loss and financial position.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company had cash of $ 224,224
and $ 2,877 , respectively.   Accounts Receivable   Accounts receivable are recorded in accordance with ASC 310, “Receivables.” Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company does not currently have any amount recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on management’s estimate and based on all accounts being current, the Company has not deemed it necessary to reserve for doubtful accounts at this time.   As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company had accounts receivable of $ 7,995
and $ 1,104 , respectively.   Prepaid Expense .
Prepaid expenses relate to security deposit for office premise and prepayment made for future services in advance that will be expensed over time as the benefit of the services is received in the future expected within one year. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, prepaid expense was $ 146,296
and $ 445,633 , respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, $ 144,296
was a prepayment for common shares issued to consultants and $ 2,000
is related to a security deposit for office premise. As of April 30, 2022, $ 443,633
was a prepayment for common shares issued to consultants and $ 2,000
is related to a security deposit for office premise.
January 31,     April 30,       2023     2022   Security Deposit   $ 2,000     $ 2,000   Prepayment for shares issued to consultants     144,296       443,633   Total   $ 146,296     $ 445,633     Inventory   Inventory is stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method.   No reserves are considered necessary for slow moving or obsolete inventory as inventory on hand at quarter-end was purchased near the end of the quarter. The Company continuously evaluates the adequacy of these reserves and makes adjustments to these reserves as required.   As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company had inventory of $ 23,071
and $ 0 , respectively. (Note 4)     9 Table of Contents   Intangible Assets   The Company accounts for intangible assets (including trademarks and formula) in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.”
ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.   The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. (Note 4)   Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.   Property, Plant and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The depreciation and amortization methods are designed to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in years, of the respective assets as follows:   Furniture and Equipment 3 - 5
years Computer Equipment
2
years   Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements of a major nature are capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in income.   The long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, no impairment losses have been identified.     10 Table of Contents   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products in accordance with ASC 606, “ Revenue Recognition ” following the five steps procedure:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers - The invoice has been generated and provided to the customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract - The performance obligations of delivery of products are stated in the invoice. Step 3: Determine the transaction price - The transaction price has been identified in the invoice. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations - The Company has allocated the transaction price to performance obligation in the invoice. Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation - The Company has shipped out the product and, therefore, satisfied the performance obligation. The risk of loss passed to the customers at the point of shipment.    The Company engages in the business of organizing, promoting, and operating industry-specific group purchase organizations (GPOs). A GPO is an entity created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors. The Company identifies underserved markets, segments, and industries where there is little to no competition and develops specific GPOs around them. The Company develops industry specific GPOs that leverage the aggregated purchasing power of its members. The GPOs use collective buying power to obtain and negotiate discounts on products and services from vendors. The discounted rates are then shared with its members saving them money and time by also improving supply chain efficiencies.   The Company is comprised of HealthGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the Healthcare industry, cbdGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the hemp industry, DISTRO+, our distribution division and GPO for specialty retailers, and Nutriumph® Supplements. In addition, GPOPlus offers professional services through GPOPRO Services.   During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized $ 186,425
and $ 990,753
of revenues related to merchandise and product sales, and $ 516
and $ 5,060
of revenues related to shipping recovered on merchandise sales, respectively, resulting in total revenue of $ 186,941
and $ 995,813 , respectively. The Company incurred cost of revenue of $ 122,473
and $ 752,812
and generated gross profit of $ 64,468
and $ 243,001
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In regard to the sales that occurred during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, there are no unfulfilled obligations related to the merchandise and product sales.   Segments   Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment and all of the Company’s revenues and operations are currently in the United States.   Financial Instruments   The carrying values of our financial instruments comprised of our current assets and liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments.   Related Party Balances and Transactions   The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “ Related Party Disclosures ,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (Note 7)   Convertible Financial Instruments   The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable US GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable US GAAP.     11 Table of Contents   When the Company has historically determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts have been recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. On May 1, 2021, the Company chose to early adopt ASU 2020-06 and did not record a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) discount on the issuance of convertible notes with the conversion rate below the Company’s market stock price on the date of note issuance.   Share-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all such compensation to employees and non-employees to be calculated based on its fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date and recognized in the earnings over the requisite service or vesting period.   During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $ 1,603,287
stock-based compensation expense and $ 28,230,643
stock-based compensation expense, which includes stock payable of $ 0
and $ 6,336,505 , respectively, and amortization of stock issued for prepaid services of $299,337 and $0 respectively. The stock-based compensation incurred from common stock awarded to consultants and executives was reported under professional fees and professional fees - related parties in the statements of operation.       Nine months ended       January 31,
2022     2022   Common stock award to consultants   $ 917,089     $ 7,230,055   Common stock award to management and executives - related parties     686,198       21,000,588       $ 1,603,287     $ 28,230,643     Basic and Diluted Loss per Share   Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.   For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Series A preferred stock, convertible notes, warrants and common stock payable were potentially dilutive instruments and were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.        January 31,     January 31,       2023     2022       (Shares)     (Shares)   Series A Preferred Shares     1,000,000       1,000,000   Convertible Notes     263,000       348,731   Warrants     168,000       448,000   Common Stock Payable     -       381,500         1,431,000       2,178,231     The Company had

As of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, the convertible notes were $ 263,000
and $ 348,731
net of note discount of $ 0
and $ 84,269 , respectively. As of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, the convertible shares from the convertible notes were
263,000
shares and
348,731

448,000
three-year attached warrants from the convertible notes of $ 448,000
to purchase the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $ 1.25

280,000
shares of common stock through the exercise of warrant shares from the convertible note of $ 280,000
issued on June 16, 2021, for proceeds of $ 42,000

168,000
and
448,000 , respectively. (Note 6)   As of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, the Company had stock payable of $ 0
and $ 376,925  for outstanding

Net loss per share for each class of common stock is as follows:       Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended       January 31,      January 31,

Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a CCF and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). With the adoption of ASU 2020-06, entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature these debts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company chose to early adopt this standard on May 1, 2021, financial statements and did not record BCF on the issuance of convertible notes with conversion rate below the Company’s market stock price on the date of note issuance.   Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.   NOTE 4 – ASSETS PURCHASE   On July 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Assets Purchase Agreement to acquire inventory and intangible assets from Orev LLC.

In addition, unlike major GPOs, GPO Plus has low MOQ’s (minimum order quantities) which enable small and mid-sized companies to participate with larger corporations.

We generated revenues of $186,941 and gross profit of $64,468 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, incurred net loss of $2,654,267 during the period and have accumulated a net loss of $33,120,867 since our inception. We expect to generate additional losses for the foreseeable future while we establish our business.   We will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources.   Contractual Obligations   Not required for smaller reporting companies   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.     34 Table of Contents   Critical Accounting Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    As a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of January 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2023.
C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   Our management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements, due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.     35 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings    On August 14, 2020, the Company was included in what it believes to be a non-material litigation filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Hernando County, Florida Case No. 20-CA-0652, MNP Industries, LLC (“Plaintiff”) vs Smeal et al. The complaint, which alleges the breach of certain non-compete agreements by multiple defendants, attempts to implicate the Company on the mistaken belief that the Company had acquired another defendant, Miracle Products, LLC. There is not, however, any common ownership or affiliate relationship among the Company and the co-defendants, and the Company is not party to any non-compete agreement with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff amended its complaint to allege breach of NDA and Trade Secret violations which the Company believes to be groundless. The Company has instructed counsel to file a motion to dismiss the complaint as it relates to the Company on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. On December 17, 2020, the court issued an order, denying the Plaintiff’s request, and so all of the defendants in the case are now free to work for a competitor of Plaintiff and can service current and former customers of Plaintiff, use the customer list, and can even solicit customers and or the customer list. This was a huge victory for GPOX. The Company has instructed counsel to file a motion to dismiss the complaint as it relates to the Company on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. The latest update on this litigation is the case was referred to non-binding arbitration, the Company’s legal counsel feels the outcome will be favorable for the Company and intends in the interim to file Motions for Summary Judgement and has advised the Company there is a reasonable likelihood the Company will prevail. Judgement was entered in favor of GPOX on all counts of MNP’s amended complaint against GPOX, but MNP filed a notice to appeal. This matter was settled on November 8, 2022, in which the parties have agreed to resolve their differences and terminate the litigation.   With the exception of the above-described complaint, which we believe to be non-material, we are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party, and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.   Item 1A. Risk Factors    As a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    None.   Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities    None.   Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures    Not applicable.   Item 5. Other Information    None      36 Table of Contents   Item 6. Exhibits    Exhibit Number   Exhibit 31   Certification of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002       32   Certification of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer) pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C.
