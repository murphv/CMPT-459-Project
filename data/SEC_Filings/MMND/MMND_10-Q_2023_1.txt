6 Table of Contents   Mastermind, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   1. Business   Mastermind, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or the “organization”) is an involvement marketing service agency that designs, creates and develops branding and marketing campaigns, primarily for large corporate clients with well-known brands. We specialize in customer conversion initiatives that we believe facilitate the involvement of more of the “right customers” with the brands of our clients. We focus on converting prospects to customers. Our programs can take on various forms, including creating and managing content marketing, influencer marketing, social marketing/community management, digital issues management communications, promotions, Augmented Reality Marketing, and UX Analytics & Digital Intelligence.   2. Interim Financial Statements and Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information pursuant to Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which we consider necessary, for a fair presentation of those financial statements. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2022, may not necessarily be indicative of results that may be expected for any succeeding period or for the entire fiscal year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, and that affect the amounts reported in our unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments. In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives and valuation of property and equipment.   There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.   Reclassifications   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.   3. Related Party Transactions   On January 3, 2012, we entered into a perpetual license agreement (the “Perpetual License”) with Mastermind Marketing, Inc. (the “Licensor”), which provides for licenses of trademarks, internet domains, and certain intellectual property as defined in the Perpetual License. The Licensor is one of our members and its chief executive officer is also our chief executive officer. The Perpetual License, which may be terminated at any time by either party, is effective January 3, 2012 and provides for aggregate payments of $ 2,100,000
over the calendar years from 2019 through 2039 with no further payments required after December 31, 2039. The Company has recorded expenses related to the license of $ 15,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (Note 5).
On January 3, 2014, we entered into a commercial lease agreement (the “Lease”) with 1450 West Peachtree, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (the “Landlord”), for the lease of our corporate facility in Atlanta, Georgia. The manager of the Landlord is also our chief executive officer. The term of the original lease was for
10
years from the date of the agreement. During the period ended December 31, 2022 the Company gave notice to our landlord for our leased office space to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2022 with no payments due thereafter. The landlord agreed to the termination of the lease with no penalties and no additional payments required. The Company has adopted a fully remote work environment and no replacement office space is planned for.  During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we made lease payments of $ 41,422
and $ 30,000 , respectively, in satisfaction of our obligation pursuant to the Lease (Note 6).   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we made payments to our three members pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement, as amended, for services rendered to us. The Company recorded expenses to our three
members during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, aggregating $ 274,840
and $ 161,224 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we owed $ 0
to our three majority stockholders for consulting services.     7 Table of Contents   4. Property and Equipment   Property and equipment consist of the following:       December 31,     September 30,       2022     2022   Furniture, fixtures and office equipment   $ 165,060     $  161,640   Leasehold improvements     -       73,795   Property and equipment, gross     165,060       235,435   Less: accumulated depreciation     ( 124,215 )     ( 183,431 ) Property and equipment, net   $ 40,845     $ 52,004     Depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 5,970

included in other income (expense).
5. Licensing Agreements   On January 3, 2012, we entered into a perpetual license agreement (the “Perpetual License”) with Mastermind Marketing, Inc. (the “Licensor”), which provides for licenses of trademarks, internet domains, and certain intellectual property as defined in the Perpetual License. The Licensor is one of our members and its chief executive officer is also our chief executive officer. The Perpetual License, which may be terminated at any time by either party, is effective January 3, 2012 and provides for aggregate payments of $ 2,100,000
over the calendar years from 2019 through 2039 with no further payments required after December 31, 2039. The Company has recorded expenses of $ 15,000
and $ 15,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   In consideration for the Perpetual License, we agreed to pay the following fees through fiscal year 2040 (calendar year 2039):   Fiscal Years Ending September 30,   Amount   2023   $ 60,000   2024     60,000   2025     60,000   2026     120,000       2027                         120,000   Thereafter     1,440,000       $ 1,860,000       8 Table of Contents   6. Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities   Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is our incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be  5.5 %, as the interest rate implicit in our lease is not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized pursuant to ASC Topic 842 Leases (Topic 842) over the lease term. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded rent expense of $ 41,422
and $ 30,000 , respectively.   In adopting Topic 842, the Company has elected the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permit it not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter is not applicable to the Company. In addition, the Company elected not to apply ASC Topic 842 to arrangements with lease terms of 12 month or less. During the year ended September 30, 2020, upon adoption of ASC Topic 842 for the 10-year commercial lease with 1450 West Peachtree, LLC for our leased office space, the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $ 461,740 .   During the period ended December 31, 2022 the Company gave notice to our landlord for our leased office space to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2022 with no payments due thereafter. The landlord agreed to the termination of the lease with no penalties and no additional payments required. The Company has adopted a fully remote work environment and no replacement office space is planned for.   The Right-of-use assets are summarized below:
December 31,     September 30,       2022     2022   Office Lease   $ -     $ 461,740   Less accumulated amortization     -       ( 307,924 ) Right-of-use, net   $ -     $ 153,816     Amortization on the right-of-use asset is included in general and administrative expense on the statements of operations.   Operating lease liabilities are summarized below:       December 31,     September 30,       2022     2022   Lease liability   $ -     $ 153,816   Less: current portion     -       ( 114,389 ) Long term portion   $ -     $ 39,427       9 Table of Contents   7. Commitments and Contingencies                  Litigation   On February 11, 2022, a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (the “Complaint”) was filed by a plaintiff (the “Plaintiff”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Complaint named Mastermind, Inc. (“the Company”) and Daniel Dodson, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, (the “CEO”). The Company and the CEO are collectively referred to herein as “Defendants”. The Complaint includes alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of implied contract by the Defendants related to the Plaintiff’s allegations that he was entitled to
3,000,000
shares of common stock of the Company from the reverse merger transaction completed on February 14, 2018. The Defendants successfully got the Complaint transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.  The Defendants will contest the complaint and believe they will prevail.   Other than the above we are not a party to any other legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, which we believe will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.    8. Income Taxes
Prior to February 14, 2018, the effective date of the Business Combination, no provision for income taxes was made since we were treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and the income or loss was passed through to our members.   We are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States. The preparation of these tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by us. In consultation with our tax advisors, we base our tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various federal and state taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we file tax returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the income tax positions taken by us (“uncertain tax positions”) and, therefore, may require us to pay additional taxes. As required under applicable accounting rules, we accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability, including interest and penalties, which we could incur as a result of the ultimate or effective resolution of the uncertain tax positions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.   There were no unrecognized material tax benefits at December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. There were no accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest expense recognized during the periods presented. We have determined we have no uncertain tax positions.   Tax returns are subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities for generally three years after filed. There are no income tax examinations currently in process.   The Company files it’s income tax returns on the cash basis of accounting utilizing a December 31 tax year end. Deferred tax assets relating to current liabilities result from accounts payable and accrued expenses and unearned revenues which are not currently deductible for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities relating to current assets result from accounts receivables, unbilled receivables and prepaid expenses which are not currently recognized as income for tax reporting purposes.   As of December 31, 2022, the Company has no net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.   On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate
decrease from 35% to 21%
for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing.     10 Table of Contents   9. Stockholders ’

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions.   In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act, we are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. For example, we may encounter competitive, technological, financial and business challenges making it more difficult than expected to continue to develop and market our products; the market may not accept our existing and future products; we may not be able to retain our customers; we may be unable to retain existing key management personnel; and there may be other material adverse changes in our operations or business. Certain important factors affecting the forward-looking statements made herein also include, but are not limited to (i) continued downward pricing pressures in our targeted markets, (ii) the continued acquisition of our customers by certain of our competitors, and (iii) continued periods of net losses, which could require us to find additional sources of financing to fund operations, implement our financial and business strategies, meet anticipated capital expenditures and fund research and development costs. In addition, assumptions relating to budgeting, marketing, product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing, capital expenditure or other budgets, which may in turn affect our financial position and results of operations. For all of these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law. For further information, you are encouraged to review our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2018, as amended on April 20, 2018, and risk factors as discussed therein under Item 2.01.   Overview   Mastermind, Inc. is a digital marketing agency that plans, executes and analyzes digital marketing initiatives for clients in numerous industries including Fashion, Automotive, Spirits & Beer, Business-to-business, Consumer Electronics, Banking & Financial Services, Consumer Packaged Goods, Food & Beverage, Healthcare, Home Improvement, Restaurants, Retail, Technology, and Communications.

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon these financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the past, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates. However, results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   Results of Operations   Three Months Ended

The increase is attributable to the timing of project work being completed, and also the revenue being recognized for direct expenses (media, influencer fees, etc.) attributable to jobs. These fluctuations in work accomplished and revenue being recognized for direct expenses are normal occurrences in our business.   Gross Profit   Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $621,255 or 59.6% of revenues, compared with $533,457 or 62.2% of revenues, for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross profit dollars was a result of higher revenues in the current period. The decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily a result of the Company having fewer projects with lower direct expenses achieving billing milestones in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to same period of last year. Direct cost includes expenses for media, sponsorship fees, etc. Gross margin will fluctuate from year to year based on the types of work assigned to the Company by its clients.     13 Table of Contents   Operating Expenses   Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $577,092 as compared with $471,246 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $105,846 or 22.5%. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in management consulting of $114,500 due to distribution to three members of $110,000 in current period as compared to $0 distribution for the comparable prior year period. The distribution is usually decided based on a combination of the Company’s operation results and performance of the Company's management group and their respective member companies. There was also a decrease in wages and benefits of $9,048 and an increase of other general and administrative costs of $394. Professional fees (including public company expenses), as part of general and administrative costs, remained relatively consistent increasing by $1,862.      Income
from Operations   Income from Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $18,048 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the increase in management consulting of $114,500, offsetting by the increase in gross profit dollars of $87,798.      Other
Income
and
Expense   Other income and expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was an expense of $7,344 as compared to income of $607 for the comparable prior year period.  The expense was primarily due to the loss on disposition of the leasehold improvements upon the early termination of the lease.
Income Before Provision for Income Taxes    Income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $36,819 as compared to $62,818 for the comparable prior year period.    Provision for Income Taxes   Provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $50,477 as compared to $16,383 for the comparable prior year period.  The increase is primarily due to changes in unbilled receivables, unearned revenues, updates for disposition of leasehold improvements and other capital asset updates. Provision for income taxes is estimated quarterly applying both federal and state tax rates.   Liquidity and Capital Resources       December 31,     September 30,                   2022     2022     Change     %   Cash   $ 1,712,771     $ 1,735,140     $ (22,369 )   (1.3 )%                                  Current assets   $ 3,391,908     $ 3,326,379     $ 65,529       2.0 % Current liabilities   $ 454,895     $ 551,733     $ (96,838 )   (17.6 )%  Working capital

Our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; costs incurred in connection with performance on client projects; facility and facility-related costs, material, management consulting and professional fees. The sources of our cash flows from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from clients in connection with the performance on contractually agreed-upon projects. Net cash flows from operating activities for the current period were a result of the net loss, loss on disposition of assets, depreciation expense, change of deferred tax and changes in current assets and liabilities of $70,347.      14 Table of Contents   During the three months ended December 31, 2021, $65,882 was provided by operating activities, which were a result of the net income, stock compensation expense, depreciation expense, change of deferred tax and changes in current assets and liabilities of $6,954.    During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we purchased $3,420 in computer equipment, and during the three months ended December 31, 2021, there were no investing activities.   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any cash flow activity from financing activities.   The ability to attract additional capital investments for more rapid expansion in the future will depend on many factors, including the availability of credit, rate of revenue growth, ability to acquire new client opportunities, the timing of new service product introductions and enhancements to existing services/products, and the opportunities to acquire complimentary businesses that may be made available to us from time-to-time. We believe that as of December 31, 2022, our cash position and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and planned strategic activities, excluding acquisitions, if any, for at least the next twelve months.   Any potential future sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are required to raise additional financing, but are unable to obtain such financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our operations or business development activities.   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation Reform Act”). These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.   Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   Not applicable.   Item 4.
Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of December 31, 2022, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to (i) insufficient segregation of duties in the finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel; and (ii) inadequate corporate governance policies. In the future, subject to working capital limitations, we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     15 Table of Contents   Part II. Other Information   Item1.
Legal Proceedings   On February 11, 2022, a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (the “Complaint”) was filed by a plaintiff (the “Plaintiff”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Complaint named Mastermind, Inc. (“the Company”) and Daniel Dodson, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, (the “CEO”). The Company and the CEO are collectively referred to herein as “Defendants”. The Complaint includes alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of implied contract by the Defendants related to the Plaintiff’s allegations that he was entitled to 3,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company from the reverse merger transaction completed on February 14, 2018. The Defendants successfully got the Complaint transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Defendants will contest the complaint and strongly believe they will prevail.   Other than the above, we are not a party to any legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, which we believe will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.   Item 1A.
