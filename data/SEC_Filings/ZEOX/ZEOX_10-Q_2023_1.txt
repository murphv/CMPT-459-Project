NOTE 1 –
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organicell Regenerative Medicine, Inc. f/k/a Biotech Products Services and Research, Inc. (“Organicell” or the “Company”) was incorporated on August 9, 2011 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company principally focusing on the development of innovative biological therapeutics for the treatment of degenerative diseases and the provision of other related services. The Company’s proprietary products are derived from perinatal sources and manufactured to retain the naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, hyaluronic acid, and proteins without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent. Our proprietary products are principally used in the health care industry administered through doctors and clinics (collectively, “Providers”).
On May 21, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change the Company’s name from Biotech Products Services and Research, Inc. to Organicell Regenerative Medicine, Inc., effective June 20, 2018 (the “Name Change”) and during November 2021 the Name Change was effectuated in the marketplace by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company principally operated through General Surgical of Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary, which was formed to sell the Company’s therapeutic products to Providers.
The Company’s leading product, Zofin™ (also known as Organicell TM
Flow), is an acellular, biologic therapeutic derived from perinatal sources and is manufactured to retain naturally occurring microRNAs, without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent.
In June 2021, the Company announced that it was launching a service platform for its first autologous product called Patient Pure X TM
(PPX TM ). PPX TM
is a non-manipulated biologic containing the nanoparticle fraction from a patient’s own peripheral blood. The Company began to accept minimal orders for this service in October 2021 and to date revenues from PPX TM
continue to be immaterial.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Balances in accounts are insured up to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits of $ 250,000
per institution. At January 31, 2023, the Company held $ 1,152,448
of cash balances in one financial institution in excess of FDIC insurance coverage limits.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from the estimates.
5
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions.
The policy for determining past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer, which are generally net 30 or net 60 days. Once collection efforts by the Company and its collection agency are exhausted, the determination for charging off uncollectible receivables is made. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did
no t record any bad debt expense.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. The Company provides reserves for potential excess, dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand and any firm purchase orders, as well as product shelf life. At January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that there were not any reserves required in connection with our inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment range from 3 to 15 years. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred.
Leasehold Improvements
Leasehold improvements in excess of $ 1,000
that are made in connection with leases having a term of more than 12 months are capitalized by the Company and amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the remaining lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Costs associated with leasehold improvements that do not exceed $ 1,000
are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” which requires the Company to recognize revenue in amounts that reflect the prorata completion of the performance obligations of the Company required under the contracts.
The Company recognizes revenue only when it transfers control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for the good or service. Our performance obligations are satisfied and control is transferred at a point-in-time, which is typically when the transfer and title to the product sold has taken place and there is evidence of our customer’s satisfactory acceptance of the product shipment or delivery except in those instances when the customer has made prior arrangements with the Company to store the product purchased by the customer at the Company’s facilities that is to be delivered at a later date to be designated by the customer.
6
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of fully vested common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of fully vested shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments.
At January 31, 2023, the Company had
408,800,000
common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants that were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive for the three months ended January 31, 2023. At January 31, 2022, the Company had
9,500,000
common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and unpaid Original Base Salary and Incremental Salary that could be convertible into approximately
39,836,000
common shares that were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive for the three months ended January 31, 2022.
Stock-Based Compensation
All stock-based payments are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with the development of the Company’s technologies. These costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expenses were approximately $ 194,700
and $ 276,300
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The research and development costs primarily relate to the filing and approval of IND applications and the performance of clinical trials.
Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated tax return that includes all of its subsidiaries.
Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year taxable income for federal and state income tax reporting purposes and deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of the operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Topic 740 – Income Taxes. This pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on recognition, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company incurred operating losses, and therefore, there was not any income tax expense amount recorded during those periods. There is a full valuation allowance established for the tax benefit associated with the net losses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
7
Valuation of Derivatives
The Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.
Sequencing
The Company has adopted a sequencing policy whereby, in the event that reclassification of contracts from equity to assets or liabilities is necessary pursuant to ASC 815 due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient authorized shares, shares will be allocated on the basis of the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments, with the earliest grants receiving the first allocation of shares.
The Company currently has
2,500,000,000
authorized shares of common stock of which
1,490,677,642
shares are issued and outstanding as of March 16, 2023. The Company expects that it will continue to issue common stock in the future in connection with debt and/or equity financings, transactions with third parties, performance incentives and as compensation to its employees. Currently the amount of authorized shares is sufficient to provide for the additional shares that the Company may be contingently obligated to issue under existing arrangements.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company includes fair value information in the notes to financial statements when the fair value of its financial instruments is different from the book value. When the book value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made.
The Company follows FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. It defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and convertible debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820 with respect to its financial instruments. As required by ASC 820, assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.
Level one
— Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level two
— Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
Level three
— Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter.
The Company did not have any convertible instruments outstanding at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 that qualify as derivatives.
8
Operating Lease Obligations
Under the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), the Company recognizes a right of use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability for all operating leases upon commencement of the lease. The Company applies the modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients on leases that commenced before the effective date of ASC 842, including continuing to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified and the inclusion of amounts pertaining to the maintenance portion of the leased assets.
The Company’s policy is to treat operating leases that have a term of one year or less at lease commencement date and do not include a purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise, consistent with the lease recognition approach as previously outlined under ASC 840. In addition, month to month leases which do not involve additional financial commitments on the part of the Company are also treated consistent with the lease recognition approach as previously outlined under ASC 840. The Company has established a capitalization threshold of $ 15,000
in determining whether any future operating leases will be capitalized.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events that occurred after January 31, 2023 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.
NOTE 3 –
GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has had limited revenues since
its inception. The Company incurred net losses of $ 2,176,305 2,286,656 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. In addition, the
Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 52,807,962
at January 31, 2023. The Company had a working capital deficit of $ 773,385
at
January 31, 2023.
United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
regulations which were announced in November 2017 and which became effective beginning in May 2021 (postponed from November 2020
due to the COVID-19 pandemic) require that the sale of products that fall under Section 351 of the Public Health Services Act pertaining
to marketing traditional biologics and human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”) can only be
sold pursuant to an approved biologics license application (“BLA”). The Company has not obtained any opinion or ruling regarding
the Company’s operations and whether the processing, sales and distribution of the products it currently produces would be subject
to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s.
In addition to the above, the adverse public health developments associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic combined with the downturn in the overall United States and global economies have adversely affected the demand for our products and services by our customers and from patients of our customers and which currently still continue to have a negative impact to our business and the economy.
As a result of the above, the Company’s efforts to establish a stabilized source of sufficient revenues to cover operating costs has yet to be achieved and ultimately may prove to be unsuccessful unless (a) the Company’s ability to process, sell and distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are not restricted; (b) the United States economy returns to pre-COVID-19 conditions; and/or (c) additional sources of working capital through operations or debt and/or equity financings are realized. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management anticipates that the Company will remain dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund ongoing operating expenses and research and development costs related to development of new products and to perform required clinical studies in connection with the sale of its products. The Company does not have any assets to pledge for the purpose of borrowing additional capital. In addition, the Company relies on its ability to produce and sell products it manufactures that are subject to changing technology and regulations that it currently sells and distributes to its customers. The Company’s current market capitalization, common stock liquidity and available authorized shares may hinder its ability to raise equity proceeds. The Company anticipates that future sources of funding, if any, will therefore be costly and dilutive, if available at all.
9
In view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs, recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet assumes that (a) the Company is able to continue to produce products or obtain products under supply arrangements which are in compliance with current and future regulatory guidelines; (b) the United States economy returns to pre-COVID-19 market conditions; (c) the Company will be able to establish a stabilized source of revenues, including efforts to expand sales internationally and the development of new product offerings and/or designations of products; (d) obligations to the Company’s creditors are not accelerated; (e) the Company’s operating expenses remain at current levels and/or the Company is successful in restructuring and/or deferring ongoing obligations; (f) the Company is able to continue its research and development activities, particularly in regards to remaining compliant with the FDA and ongoing safety and efficacy of its products; and/or (g) the Company obtains additional working capital to meet its contractual commitments and maintain the current level of Company operations through debt or equity sources.
There is no assurance that the products we currently produce will not be subject to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s and/or the Company will be able to complete its revenue growth strategy. There is no assurance that the Company’s research and development activities will be successful or that the Company will be able to timely fund the required costs of those activities. Without sufficient cash reserves, the Company’s ability to pursue growth objectives will be adversely impacted. Furthermore, despite significant effort since July 2015, the Company has thus far been unsuccessful in achieving a stabilized source of revenues.
If revenues do not increase and stabilize, if the Company’s ability to process, sell and/or distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are restricted, and/or if additional funds cannot otherwise be raised, the Company might be required to seek other alternatives which could include the sale of assets, closure of operations and/or protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. As of January 31, 2023, based on the factors described above, the Company concluded that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the 12 months following the issuance of these financial statements.

During March 2019, the Company entered into a lease agreement for certain lab equipment in the amount of $ 239,595 . Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company is required to make 60 equal monthly payments of $ 4,513
plus applicable sales taxes. Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has the right to acquire all of the leased equipment for $ 1.00 . As a result, the lease agreement is being accounted for as a finance lease obligation. The annual interest rate charged in connection with the lease is
4.5 %. The leased equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives of
15
years.
During October 2021, the Company entered into a second lease agreement in the amount of $ 304,873
for certain lab equipment that is being installed at the Basalt lab location. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company is required to make 60 equal monthly payments of $ 5,478
plus applicable sales taxes. Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has the right to acquire all of the leased equipment for $ 1.00 . As a result, the lease agreement is being accounted for as a finance lease obligation. The annual interest rate charged in connection with the lease is
3.0 %. Lease payments and depreciation of the leased equipment began during May 2022, the date that the Basalt lab buildout was completed (see below) and the facility became operational. The leased equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives of
15
years.
Operating Lease Obligations:
On August 30, 2022, the Company entered into a one-year lease agreement (“LA Office Lease”) for office space in Los Angeles, California commencing September 1, 2022 and ending August 31, 2023. The Company was required to make a one-time prepayment of the annual rent in the amount of $ 160,000
and provide a security deposit of $ 10,000
upon execution of the lease agreement. The lease is non-renewable.
Laboratory Facilities:
Effective July 1, 2022, the Company entered into a six-month lease agreement for an approximately 450 square foot laboratory and additional administrative office space effective July 1, 2022 (“New Miami Lab Lease”). Monthly lease payments are approximately $ 9,500
per month plus administrative fees and taxes. The New Miami Lab Lease was not renewed and expired on December 31, 2022. The Company security deposit of $ 6,332
was returned upon expiration of the New Miami Lab Lease.

During March 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an approximately 2,452 square foot commercial space located in Basalt, Colorado (the “Basalt Lab Lease”). The Company intends to build additional laboratory processing, product distribution and administrative office capacity from this location. The term of the Basalt Lab Lease is for three years and may be renewed for an additional (3) three-year term provided the Company is not in default (“First Renewal Option”). Rental expense is $ 6,800
per month and provides for annual increases of 3% or the Denver Aurora Metropolitan CPI index, whichever is greater. In connection with the Basalt Lab Lease, the Company was required to post a security deposit of $ 13,600 . The Company completed the construction of the initial laboratory and office build-out at a cost of $ 925,932 . The Basalt Lab Lease location became operational during May 2022.

NOTES PAYABLE
Promissory Note – SPA 22
On January 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA 22”) with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“Purchaser”) pursuant to which we sold a promissory note in the principal amount of $ 600,000
(“Promissory Note”) to the Purchaser in a private transaction for a purchase price of $540,000 (giving effect to original issue discount of $ 60,000 ). The Promissory Note matured on
January 11, 2023
and the Promissory Note was paid in full.
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA 22, the Company paid a commitment fee to the Purchaser in the amount of $ 123,000
(“Initial Commitment Fee”) in the form of
3,076,923
shares of the Company’s common stock (“Initial Commitment Fee Shares”) valued at $ 0.04 , the closing price of the common stock of the Company on the closing date. In addition, in connection with the Extension, the Company paid an additional commitment fee to the Purchaser in the amount of $ 33,231
in the form of an additional
1,538,462
shares of its common stock (“Additional Commitment Fee Shares,” and together with the Initial Commitment Fee Shares, collectively, “Commitment Fee Shares”) valued at $ 0.0216 , the closing price of the common stock of the Company on the Extension date.
In the event that by the earlier of the first anniversary of repayment of the Promissory Note by the Company or the date that the Purchaser has sold all of the Commitment Fee Shares (“True-Up Date”), the Purchaser has not generated the amount of $ 300,000
from public sales of the Commitment Fee Shares, the Company shall either pay the amount of any such shortfall either (i) by issuing additional shares of our common stock at a price equal to the VWAP for the common stock during the five (5) trading day period prior to the True-up Date (“Conversion Price”); or (ii) in cash, in which case, the Company shall repurchase any unsold Commitment Fee Shares then held by the Purchaser for such shortfall amount (“Commitment Fee Shortfall Obligation”).

Business Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company principally focusing on the development of innovative biological therapeutics for the treatment of degenerative diseases and regenerative medicine. The Company’s proprietary products are derived from perinatal sources and manufactured to retain the naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, hyaluronic acid, and proteins without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent (“RAAM Products”). Our RAAM Products and related services are principally used in the health care industry administered through doctors and clinics (“Providers”).
Organicell operates an extracellular vesicle processing laboratory in Davie, Florida, and Basalt, Colorado each for the purpose of performing research and development and the manufacturing and processing of the anti-aging and cellular therapy derived products that we sell and distribute to our customers.
The Company’s leading product, Zofin™ (also known as Organicell™ Flow), is an acellular, biologic therapeutic derived from perinatal sources and is manufactured to retain naturally occurring microRNAs, without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent. This product contains over 300 growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and 102 unique microRNAs as well as other exosomes/nanoparticles derived from perinatal tissues.
To date, the Company has obtained certain Investigational New Drug (“IND”), and 18 emergency IND (“eIND”) approvals from the FDA, including applicable Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approvals which authorized the Company to commence clinical trials or treatments in connection with the use of Zofin™ and related treatment protocols. The Company is pursuing efforts to complete its already approved clinical studies as well as obtaining approval to commence additional studies for other specific indications it has identified that the use of its products will provide more favorable and desired health related benefits for patients seeking alternative treatment options than are currently available. The ability of the Company to succeed in these efforts is subject to among other things, the Company having sufficient available working capital to fund the substantial costs of completing clinical trials, which the Company currently does not have, and ultimately, obtaining approval from the FDA.
20
New FDA guidance which was announced in November 2017 and which became effective in May 2021 (postponed from November 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) requires that the sale of products that fall under Section 351 of the Public Health Services Act pertaining to marketing traditional biologics and human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”) can only be sold pursuant to an approved biologics license application (“BLA”).
We have not obtained any opinion or ruling regarding the Company’s operations and whether the processing, sales and distribution of the products we currently produce would be subject to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s. However, we do not believe that our products fall within these guidelines and intend to vigorously defend against any adverse interpretation by the FDA on the classification of our products that may be deemed as falling under this defined regulation, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are undertaking efforts on an ongoing basis to mitigate any potential risks associated with an adverse ruling by the FDA and the subsequent limitations on our ability to continue to generate revenues from the sale of our products in the United States until the Company obtains the required licenses. The efforts include continuing with clinical trials, expanding sales internationally and developing new product offerings and/or designations of products that would not fall under these regulations.
In June 2021, the Company announced that it was launching a service platform for its first autologous product called Patient Pure X TM
(PPX TM ). PPX TM
is a non-manipulated biologic containing the nanoparticle fraction from a patient’s own peripheral blood. The Company began to accept minimal orders for this service in October 2021 and to date revenues from PPX TM
continue to be immaterial.
COVID-19 impact on Economy and Business Environment
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the United States have adversely affected the demand for our products and services by our customers and from patients of our customers as a result of quarantines, facility closures and social distancing measures put into effect. These restrictions have adversely affected the Company’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company (a) has accelerated its research and development activities; (b) has secured and is continuing to seek additional debt and/or equity financing to support working capital requirements; and (c) continues to take steps to stabilize and increase revenues from the sale of its products.
There is no assurance as to when the adverse impact to the United States and worldwide economies resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak will be eliminated, if at all, and whether any new or recurring pandemic outbreaks will occur again in the future causing a similar or worse devastating impact to the United States and worldwide economies or our business.
The following discussion of the Company’s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing in
Item 1 . of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Results of Operations
Three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to three months ended January 31, 2022
Revenues . Our revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $1,070,219, compared to revenues of $1,599,147 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in revenues during the three months ended January 31, 2023 of $528,928 or 33.1%, was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately 20.8% (approximately $274,500) in the overall unit sales of its products during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately 15.0% (approximately $232,400) in the average sales prices for the products sold during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the average sales prices realized on products sold during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and a decrease of approximately $22,000 of new revenues associated with its recently launched PPX TM
service platform during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in the average sales prices realized on products sold during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, was due to decreases in sales of higher priced medical grade products, partially offset from the increase in the sales of the Company’s aesthetic product offerings, which are sold at lower prices than the Company’s medical grade product offerings.
21
Cost of Revenues . Our cost of revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $104,313, compared with cost of revenues of $149,120 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in the cost of revenues during the three months ended January 31, 2023 of $44,807 or 30.1%, compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, was due to a decrease in the amount of units sold of 20.1% (approximately $27,400) during the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022 and a decrease in the cost of units sold of 11.7% (approximately ($17,400) during the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to costs of units sold during the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in the cost of units sold was primarily the result of the Company’s decrease in sales of higher cost medical grade product offerings, partially offset from the increased in sales of lower cost aesthetic product offerings.
Gross Profit . Our gross profit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $965,906 (90.3% of revenues), compared with gross profit of $1,450,027 (90.7% of revenues) for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in gross profit during the three months ended January 31, 2023 of $484,121 was the result decreases in the average sales prices for the products sold during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and decreases in overall unit sales of its products during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022.
General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $3,142,211, compared with $3,091,459 for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $50,752 or 1.6%. The increase in the general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, was primarily the result of an increase in stock-based compensation costs to advisors, consultants and administrative staff totaling approximately $446,200, increases in insurance costs of approximately $117,800, increased laboratory related costs of approximately $132,500 and increased investor relations costs of approximately $188,900, partially offset by decreased payroll and consulting fees of approximately $378,000, decreases in commissions from sales of the Company’s products and travel and entertainment costs of approximately $266,200, decreased professional fees of approximately $98,200 and decreased research and development costs of approximately $81,600. The increase in stock-based compensation costs during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022 was principally the result of the amortization of costs from warrants issued as stock-based compensation to consultants in connection with the Restructuring in August 2022, stock issued as payment for services, and warrants issued to outside directors. The increase in insurance costs during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022 was principally the result of the Company’s newly obtained directors & officers insurance policy in November 2023. The decrease in payroll and consulting fees during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022 was principally the result of the Executives’ agreement to a reduction in salary and other compensation in connection with the Restructuring and reductions in fees paid to consultants. The decreases in commissions on from sales of the Company’s products and travel and entertainment costs was principally the result of lower unit sales and overall revenues from the sale of the Company’s products during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022.
Other Expense.
Other expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $110,351, compared with other expense of $52,304 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The increase in other expense of $58,047 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022, was principally the result of the increase in the Commitment Fee Shortfall Obligation of approximately $37,400 under our Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA 22”) with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB”) during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022 and increased interest costs of approximately $20,700 in connection with the $600,000 promissory note (“$600,000 Note”) issued and sold by the Company to AJB in January 2022 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022.

During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company used cash in operating activities of $1,282,724, compared to $559,994 for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase in cash used of $772,730. The increase in cash used in operating activities was due to the decrease in revenues and gross profit, payment of past due accounts payable and accrued expenses, the decrease in accrued liabilities to management and the increase in inventory balances during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022.
During the three months ended January 31,
2023, the Company had cash used in investing activities of $16,117, compared to cash used in investing activities of $155,134 for the
three months ended January 31, 2022, a decrease in cash used of $139,017. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily
due to the reduction in payments made for leasehold improvements associated with the new lab facility in Basalt, CO of approximately $102,000
and a decrease in laboratory equipment purchased for the Company’s laboratory facilities of approximately $37,000 during the three
months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022.
During the three months ended January 31,
2023, the Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,031,755 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $756,878 for
the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $1,788,633 was due to decreases
in proceeds of $540,000 from the issuance of the $600,000 Note to AJB, increases in the escrow deposit for the share purchase of $500,000,
increases in repayment of notes payable of $429,000, increases in payments on finance leases of approximately $19,600 and the reduction
in the sale of equity securities of approximately $300,000 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the three
months ended January 31, 2022.
Capital Resources
The Company has historically relied on the sale of debt or equity securities, the restructuring of debt obligations and/or the issuance and/or exchange of equity securities to meet the shortfall in cash to fund its operations.
Put Request
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement entered into with Tysadco Partners LLC, on December 2, 2022, the Company submitted a put request to Tysadco to purchase 4,456,326 registered shares at a purchase price (as calculated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) of $0.02244, for a total of $100,000 (“Put Request”). On December 5, 2022, Tysadco funded the Put Request and the Company issued 4,456,326 shares to Tysadco. The proceeds from the share sale are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
23
SPA 23
On March 6, 2023, the Company entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA 23”) with AJB Capital, pursuant to which we sold a Promissory Note in the principal amount
of $530,000 (“$530,000 Note”) to AJB Capital in a private transaction to for a purchase price of $519,400 (giving effect to
original issue discount of $10,600). In connection with the sale of the $530,000 Note, the Company also paid AJB Capital’s legal
fees and due diligence costs of $15,000, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $504,400, which will be used for working capital
and other general corporate purposes.
Going Concern Consideration
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company
as a going concern. The Company has had limited revenues since its inception. The Company incurred net losses of $2,286,656 for the three
months ended January 31, 2023. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $52,807,962 at January 31, 2023. The Company
had a working capital deficit of $773,385 at January 31, 2023.
United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
regulations which were announced in November 2017 and which became effective beginning in May 2021 (postponed from November 2020
due to the COVID-19 pandemic) require that the sale of products that fall under Section 351 of the Public Health Services Act pertaining
to marketing traditional biologics and human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”) can only be
sold pursuant to an approved biologics license application (“BLA”). The Company has not obtained any opinion or ruling regarding
the Company’s operations and whether the processing, sales and distribution of the products it currently produces would be subject
to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s.
In addition to the above, the adverse public health developments associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic combined with the downturn in the overall United States and global economies have adversely affected the demand for our products and services by our customers and from patients of our customers and which currently still continue to have a negative impact to our business and the economy.
As a result of the above, the Company’s efforts to establish a stabilized source of sufficient revenues to cover operating costs has yet to be achieved and ultimately may prove to be unsuccessful unless (a) the Company’s ability to process, sell and distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are not restricted; (b) the United States economy returns to pre-COVID-19 conditions; and/or (c) additional sources of working capital through operations or debt and/or equity financings are realized. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management anticipates that the Company will remain dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund ongoing operating expenses and research and development costs related to development of new products and to perform required clinical studies in connection with the sale of its products. The Company does not have any assets to pledge for the purpose of borrowing additional capital. In addition, the Company relies on its ability to produce and sell products it manufactures that are subject to changing technology and regulations that it currently sells and distributes to its customers. The Company’s current market capitalization, common stock liquidity and available authorized shares may hinder its ability to raise equity proceeds. The Company anticipates that future sources of funding, if any, will therefore be costly and dilutive, if available at all.
In view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs, recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet assumes that (a) the Company is able to continue to produce products or obtain products under supply arrangements which are in compliance with current and future regulatory guidelines; (b) the United States economy returns to pre-COVID-19 market conditions; (c) the Company will be able to establish a stabilized source of revenues, including efforts to expand sales internationally and the development of new product offerings and/or designations of products; (d) obligations to the Company’s creditors are not accelerated; (e) the Company’s operating expenses remain at current levels and/or the Company is successful in restructuring and/or deferring ongoing obligations; (f) the Company is able to continue its research and development activities, particularly in regards to remaining compliant with the FDA and ongoing safety and efficacy of its products; and/or (g) the Company obtains additional working capital to meet its contractual commitments and maintain the current level of Company operations through debt or equity sources.
24
There is no assurance that the products we currently produce will not be subject to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s and/or the Company will be able to complete its revenue growth strategy. There is no assurance that the Company’s research and development activities will be successful or that the Company will be able to timely fund the required costs of those activities. Without sufficient cash reserves, the Company’s ability to pursue growth objectives will be adversely impacted. Furthermore, despite significant effort since July 2015, the Company has thus far been unsuccessful in achieving a stabilized source of revenues.
If revenues do not increase and stabilize, if the Company’s ability to process, sell and/or distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are restricted, and/or if additional funds cannot otherwise be raised, the Company might be required to seek other alternatives which could include the sale of assets, closure of operations and/or protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. As of January 31, 2023, based on the factors described above, the Company concluded that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the 12 months following the issuance of these financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance sheet financing arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a) (4) (ii) of Regulation S-K) and as of January 31, 2023 and through the date of this report, we had no such arrangements.
Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards
There were no recently issued financial accounting standards that would have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require us to make significant estimates and judgments. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated appropriately and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of January 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. See the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, for a description of the Company’s material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
