The Company and Basis of Presentation
Nature of Operations —Vista Outdoor Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "Vista Outdoor", "we", "our", and "us", unless the context otherwise requires) is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of outdoor recreation and shooting sports products. We operate through
two
reportable segments, Sporting Products and Outdoor Products. We are headquartered in Anoka, Minnesota and have manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico along with international customer service, sales and sourcing operations in Asia and Europe. We have a robust global distribution network serving customers in over
100
countries. Vista Outdoor was incorporated in Delaware in 2014.
Basis of Presentation —Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain disclosures and other financial information that normally are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. Management is responsible for the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, which in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods and dates presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”), which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022. Significant Accounting Policies — Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022,
which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements —No recent accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 2.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We measure and disclose our financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified using the three-tier hierarchy: Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Level 3—Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. The following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure our financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis:
Derivatives We periodically enter into commodity forward contracts to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on certain commodities we use for raw material components in our manufacturing process and to reduce the variability associated with exchange rate fluctuations. When actual commodity prices or foreign exchange rates exceed the fixed price provided by these contracts, we receive this difference from the counterparty, and when actual commodity prices or foreign exchange rates are below the contractually provided fixed price, we pay this difference to the counterparty. We consider these to be Level 2 instruments. See Note 5,
Derivative Financial Instruments , for additional information. Note Receivable In connection with the sale of our Firearms business in July 2019, we received a $ 12,000
interest-free,  five-year
pre-payable promissory note due June 2024. Based on the general market conditions and the credit quality of the buyer at the time of the sale, we discounted the Note Receivable at an effective interest rate of
10 % and estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow approach. We consider this to be a Level 3 instrument. Subsequent to our third fiscal quarter end, this promissory note was settled in full. See Note 8,
Receivables,
for additional information.
6 Table
of Contents Contingent Consideration In connection with some of our acquisitions, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities that can be earned by the sellers upon achievement of certain milestones. The liabilities are measured on a recurring basis and recorded at fair value, using a discounted cash flow analysis or a Monte Carlo simulation analysis in a risk-neutral framework with assumptions for volatility, market price of risk adjustment, risk-free rate, and cost of debt, utilizing revenue projections for the respective earn-out period, corresponding targets and approximate timing of payments as outlined in the purchase agreements. The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities are considered to be Level 3 inputs due to the lack of relevant market activity and significant management judgment. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation results from changes in discount periods and rates, and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. The fair value adjustments are recorded in selling, general, and administrative in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. As of December 25, 2022, the estimated fair values of contingent consideration payable related to our acquisitions of QuietKat, Stone Glacier, Fox Racing, Fiber Energy, and HEVI-Shot are $ 11,823 , $ 9,939 , $ 6,400 , $ 3,625 , and $ 300 , respectively. See Note 4, Acquisitions, for additional information.
Contingent consideration liabilities are reported under the following captions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets: December 25, 2022 March 31, 2022 Other current liabilities $ 16,811   $ 96   Other long-term liabilities 15,276   36,994   Total $ 32,087   $ 37,090   Following is a summary of our contingent consideration liability Level 3 activity during fiscal year 2023: Balance, March 31, 2022 $ 37,090   Acquisition of Fox Racing 11,400   Decrease in fair value ( 16,403 ) Balance, December 25, 2022 $ 32,087   Disclosures about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of our receivables, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities as of December 25, 2022 and March 31, 2022 approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents as of December 25, 2022 and March 31, 2022 are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  The table below discloses information about carrying values and estimated fair value relating to our financial assets and liabilities:
December 25, 2022 March 31, 2022 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Fixed-rate debt (1) $ 500,000   $ 365,000   $ 500,000   $ 460,000   Variable-rate debt (2) 730,000   730,000   170,000   170,000   (1) Fixed rate debt
—In fiscal year 2021, we issued $ 500,000
aggregate principal amount o f
4.5 % S enior Notes which will mature on March 15, 2029. These notes are unsecured and senior obligations. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is based on market quotes for each issuance. We consider these to be Level 2 instruments. See Note 13,
Long-term Debt,
for additional information on long-term debt, including certain risks and uncertainties. (2) Variable rate debt — The carrying value of the amounts outstanding under our 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan approximates the fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates as of December 25, 2022. The fair value of this debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on the observable market borrowing rates. See Note 13,
Long-term Debt,
for additional information on our credit facilities, including certain risks and uncertainties. We measure certain nonfinancial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis if certain indicators are present. These assets include long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired.

Leases
We lease certain warehouse and distribution space, manufacturing space, office space, retail locations, equipment, and vehicles. All of these leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. These rates are assessed on a quarterly basis. The operating lease assets also include any lease payments made less lease incentives. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For operating leases, expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments associated with our leases are recognized upon occurrence of the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed. Tenant improvement allowances are recorded as leasehold improvements with an offsetting adjustment included in our calculation of its right-of-use asset.
Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term up to

Acquisitions Simms Fishing
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we acquired Simms Fishing Products (Simms), a premium fishing brand and leading manufacturer of waders, outerwear, footwear and technical apparel. The results of this business are reported within the Outdoor Products reportable segment. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and performed a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The preliminary fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed represent management’s estimate of fair value and are subject to change if additional information, such as post-close working capital adjustments becomes available. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets received has been recorded as goodwill. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill primarily relate to acquisition-driven anticipated cost savings and synergies. Assembled workforce is not recognized separate and apart from goodwill as it is neither separable nor contractual in nature. The acquisition is not significant to our consolidated financial statements and as such we have not included disclosures of the allocation of the purchase price or any pro forma information.
Fox Racing During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we acquired Fox (Parent) Holdings, Inc. (“Fox Racing”), for a base purchase price of $ 540,000 , subject to certain customary adjustments for cash and debt, transaction expenses, and working capital. In connection with the acquisition, we refinanced our 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility by entering into the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which provides for a $ 600,000
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, and a $ 350,000
term loan facility (the “2022 Term Loan”). The proceeds of the Term Facility, together with the proceeds of a borrowing under the ABL Credit Facility, were used to finance the acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. See Note 13,
Long-term Debt , for additional information. The agreement includes up to an additional $ 50,000
of contingent consideration payable to Seller and certain individuals during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 if Fox Racing achieves certain adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA") targets during the period beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2022. The initial fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 11,400 , and is included in the total purchase consideration below. See Note 2,
Fair Value of Financial Instruments , for additional information related to the initial fair value calculation methodology and current fair value of the contingent consideration. The results of this business are reported within the Sports Protection operating segment and the Outdoor Products reportable segment.

and $ 6,064
in acquisition related costs, including legal and other professional fees, all of which were reported in selling, general, and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. This adjustment is to show the results as if those fees were incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
(2) Adjustment reflects the increased cost of goods sold expense resulting from the fair value step-up in inventory, which was expensed over inventory turns. (3) Adjustment for the estimated interest expense and debt issuance amortization expense on $ 580,000
in borrowings from Vista's 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan, used to finance the acquisition of Fox Racing. The interest rate assumed for purposes of preparing this pro forma financial information is
5.58 %. This rate is the weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan during the quarter of the acquisition. (4) Adjustment for depreciation related to the revised fair-value basis of the acquired property, plant and equipment and change in estimated useful lives. (5) Adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets. (6) Represents an adjustment for management fees historically charged by the previous owner of Fox Racing under the terms of their management agreement. (7) Income tax effect of the adjustments made at a blended federal, state, and international statutory rate adjusted for any non-deductible acquisition costs. Stone Glacier
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we acquired Stone Glacier, a premium brand focused on ultralightweight, performance hunting gear designed for backcountry use. The addition of Stone Glacier allows us to enter the packs, camping equipment, and technical apparel categories with a fast-growing brand and provide a foundation for us to leverage camping category synergies. The results of this business are reported within the Outdoor Products segment. Contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $ 9,939
was included in the purchase price. See Note 2,
Fair Value of Financial Instruments , for additional information related to the fair value calculation. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and performed a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and

The preliminary fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed represent management’s estimate of fair value and are subject to change if additional information, such as post-close working capital adjustments becomes available. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition date. The acquisition is not significant to our consolidated financial statements and as such we have not included disclosures of the allocation of the purchase price or any pro forma information.
Foresight Sports
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we acquired Foresight Sports ("Foresight"), a leading designer and manufacturer of golf performance analysis, entertainment, and game enhancement technologies for approximately $ 470,772 . The purchase agreement includes $ 5,599
related to employee retention payments, which will be accounted for separately from the business combination as post combination compensation expense. Contingent payments of up to $ 25,000
if certain net sales targets are met will also be accounted for separately from the business combination as post combination compensation expense. We used cash on hand and available liquidity under our 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility to complete the transaction. The results of this business are reported within the Outdoor Products segment. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We account for our commodity and foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC Topic 815”). ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures. Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. We may use derivatives to hedge certain interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity price risks, but do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Commodity Price Risk We use designated cash flow hedges
to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on lead we purch ase for raw material components in our ammunition manufacturing process that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges. The effectiveness of cash flow hedge contracts is assessed quantitatively at inception and qualitatively thereafter considering the transactions critical terms and counterparty credit quality. The gains and losses on these hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. The gains or losses on the lead forward contracts are recorded in inventory as the commodities are purchased and in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. As of December 25, 2022, we had outstanding lead forward contracts on approximately
9.3
million pounds of lead. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in earnings. Assets related to the lead forward contracts as of December 25, 2022 were $ 1,362
recorded in other current assets, and $ 43
recorded in other long-term assets. Foreign Exchange Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of our international subsidiaries. We use designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts as part of our strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, and Canadian Dollars.
Cash Flow Hedging Instrument We use foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments to help mitigate our exposure on our foreign subsidiaries' inventory purchases and intercompany transactions, which is different than their functional currency. These contracts generally mature within
12
months to
15
months from their inception. As of December 25, 2022, the notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedge instruments were approximately $ 47,000 .
As of December 25, 2022, net losses of $ 2,920
were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to foreign currency forward contracts. No gains or losses were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended December 25, 2022. All unrealized gains and losses as shown as of December 25, 2022 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in other income, net within the next twelve months at then-current value. The liability related to the foreign forward contracts as of December 25, 2022 of $ 3,053
is recorded as part of other current liabilities.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments We have also used non-designated hedges to hedge a portion of U.S. subsidiary sales that are recorded in Canadian Dollars. These contracts generally mature within
12
months from inception. As of December 25, 2022, the notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedge instruments were approximately $ 2,800 . 13 Table
of Contents We record these derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. Net loss of $ 81
and net gain of $ 515
for the three and nine months ended December 25, 2022 were recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, as part of
other income . The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts is $ 187
and is recorded as part of other current assets. In addition, during the three and nine months ended December 25, 2022, we recognized net foreign currency translation gains of $ 720
and $ 866 , respectively.

(4) Outdoor Recreation includes the operating segments: Hydration, Outdoor Cooking, Golf, Fishing and our Stone Glacier business. For the majority of our contracts with customers, we recognize revenue for our products at a point in time upon the transfer of control of the products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment and coincides with our right to payment, the transfer of legal title, and the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For our contracts that include bundled hardware and software sales, revenue related to delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment. Revenue allocated to
14 Table
of Contents unspecified software update rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
Typically, our contracts require customers to pay within
30 - 60
days of product delivery with a discount available to some customers for early payment. In some cases, we offer extended payment terms to customers. However, we do not consider these extended payment terms to be a significant financing component of the contract because the payment terms are less than a year. In limited circumstances, our contract with a customer may have shipping terms that indicate a transfer of control of the products upon their arrival at the destination rather than upon shipment. In those cases, we recognize revenue only when the product reaches the customer destination, which may require us to estimate the timing of transfer of control based on the expected delivery date. In all cases, however, we consider our costs related to shipping and handling to be a cost of fulfilling the contract with the customer. The total amount of revenue we recognize for the sale of our products reflects various sales adjustments for discounts, returns, refunds, allowances, rebates, and other customer incentives. These sales adjustments can vary based on market conditions, customer preferences, timing of customer payments, volume of products sold, and timing of new product launches. These adjustments require management to make reasonable estimates of the amount we expect to receive from the customer. We estimate sales adjustments by customer or by product category on the basis of our historical experience with similar contracts with customers, adjusted as necessary to reflect current facts and circumstances and our expectations for the future. Sales taxes, federal excise taxes, and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. For the immaterial amount of our contracts that have multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, we allocate revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, we use observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. We allocate revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Incentives in the form of cash paid to the customer (or a reduction of a customer cash payment to us) typically are recognized as a reduction of sales unless the incentive is for a distinct benefit that we receive from the customer, e.g., advertising or marketing. We pay commissions to some of our employees based on agreed-upon sales targets. We recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred because our sales contracts with commissions are a year or less. 7.
Earnings Per Share The computation of basic earnings per share ("EPS") is based on the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the number of basic weighted average shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive common shares, such as common stock to be issued upon exercise of options, contingently issuable shares and restricted stock units, using the treasury stock method. In computing EPS for the periods presented, earnings, as reported for each respective period, is divided by the number of shares below: Three months ended Nine months ended (Amounts in thousands except per share data) December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 Numerator: Net income

Receivables
Our trade account receivables are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for estimated credit losses under the expected credit loss model. We maintain an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable for future expected credit losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We estimate the allowance based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances and the customers' financial condition, and in relation to a representative pool of assets consisting of a large number of customers with similar risk characteristics. The allowance is adjusted as appropriate to reflect differences in current conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis, including those associated with customers that have a higher probability of default. Net receivables are summarized as follows: December 25, 2022 March 31, 2022 Trade receivables $ 385,285   $ 357,584   Other receivables 9,080   13,699   Less: allowance for estimated credit losses and discounts ( 19,069 ) ( 14,510 ) Net receivables $ 375,296   $ 356,773   No customers represented more than 10% of our total trade receivables balance as of December 25, 2022.

Long-term Debt
Long-term debt consisted of the following: December 25, 2022 March 31, 2022 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility $ —   $ 170,000   2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility 415,000   —   2022 Term Loan 315,000   —   Total Principal Amount of Credit Agreements 730,000   170,000   4.5% Senior Notes 500,000   500,000   Less: unamortized deferred financing costs related to term loans ( 11,682 ) ( 3,886 ) Carrying amount of long-term debt 1,218,318   666,114   Less: current portion ( 140,000 ) —   Carrying amount of long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 1,078,318   $ 666,114   Credit Agreements —On August 5, 2022, we refinanced our 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility by entering into the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which provides for a $ 600,000
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The amount available under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility is the lesser of the total commitment of $ 600,000
or a borrowing base based on percentages of eligible receivables, inventory, and cash, minus certain reserves, but, in each case, subject to the excess availability financial covenant under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility described below. As of December 25, 2022, the Excess Availability, or the amount available to borrow under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, based on the borrowing base less outstanding borrowings of $ 415,000
and outstanding letters of credit of $ 15,445 , less the
19 Table of Contents minimum required borrowing base of $ 60,000 , was $ 109,555 . The 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”), subject to a customary springing maturity in respect of the
4.5 % Notes due 2029 (described below) and the 2022 Term Loan (described below). Any outstanding revolving loans under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be payable in full on the Maturity Date.
Concurrently with the effectiveness of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we also obtained a $ 350,000
senior secured asset-based term loan facility (the “2022 Term Loan”). The 2022 Term Loan matures on August 5, 2024 (the "Term Maturity Date") and is subject to quarterly principal payments on the last business day of each quarter, commencing with this fiscal quarter ending December 25, 2022, in an amount equal to (i)
12.5 % of the original principal amount of the 2022 Term Loan if the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 2022 Term Loan exceeds the Term Loan Formula Threshold described below, or (ii)
10.0 % of the original principal amount of the 2022 Term Loan if the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 2022 Term Loan is equal to or less than the Term Loan Formula Threshold described below. As of December 25, 2022, our quarterly principal payments are equal to
10.0 % of the original principal amount of the 2022 Term Loan. The 2022 Term Loan is also subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements, including with respect to the net cash proceeds from the sale of certain collateral, subject to our rights to reinvest such proceeds, and a percentage of our excess cash flow, to be calculated annually. The Term Loan Formula Threshold is based on a percentage of the appraisal value of eligible intellectual property, eligible machinery and equipment, and the fair market value of eligible real property minus certain reserves. Any outstanding term loans under the 2022 Term Loan will be payable in full on the Term Maturity Date.
Borrowings under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either the sum of a base rate plus a margin ranging from
0.25 % to
0.75 % or the sum of a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") plus a credit spread adjustment of
0.10 %, plus a margin ranging from
1.25 % to
1.75 %. The margins vary based on our Average Excess Availability under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 25, 2022, the margin under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility was
0.5 % for base rate loans and
1.5 % for Term SOFR loans. We pay a commitment fee on the unused commitments under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility of
0.175 % per annum.
Borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan bear interest at a rate equal to either the sum of a base rate plus a margin ranging from
2.50 % to
3.00 % or the sum of Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of
0.10 %, plus a margin ranging from
3.50 % to
4.00 %. The margins vary based on our Term Loan Formula Threshold under the 2022 Term Loan. As of December 25, 2022, the margin under the 2022 Term Loan was
3.00 % for base rate loans and
4.00 % for Term SOFR loans.
As of December 25, 2022, the weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan was
6.14 %.
We incurred debt issuance costs related to the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $ 6,743
and unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 785
related to the 2021 ABL Credit Facility were written off during fiscal year 2023. This expense is included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $ 11,230 , including remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2021 ABL Credit Facility, are being amortized over the term of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and are included within other current and non-current assets. We incurred debt issuance costs related to the 2022 Term Loan of approximately $ 10,300 . The debt issuance costs associated with the 2022 Term Loan are being amortized to interest expense over
2
years. Substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of Vista Outdoor and our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan. 4.5 % Notes —In fiscal year 2021, we issued $ 500,000
aggregate principal amount of
4.5 % Notes that mature on March 15, 2029. These notes are unsecured and senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. We have the right to redeem some or all of these notes on or after March 15, 2024 at specified redemption prices. Prior to March 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of these notes at a price equal to
100 % of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a specified make-whole premium. In addition, prior to March 15, 2024, we may redeem up to
40 % of the aggregate principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a price equal to
104.5 % of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Debt issuance costs of approximately $ 4,491
are being amortized to interest expense over
eight years , the term of the notes. Rank and guarantees —The 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan obligations are guaranteed on a secured basis, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Vista Outdoor (the parent company issuer) has no independent assets or operations. We own
100 % of all of these guarantor subsidiaries. The
4.5 % Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Vista Outdoor and will rank equally in right of payment with
20 Table of Contents any future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of Vista Outdoor. The
4.5 % Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan or that incur or guarantee certain of our other indebtedness, or indebtedness of any subsidiary guarantor, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $ 75,000 . These guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the applicable subsidiary guarantors. The guarantee by any subsidiary guarantor of our obligations in respect of the
4.5 % Notes will be released in any of the following circumstances: • if, as a result of the sale of its capital stock, such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a restricted subsidiary, • if such subsidiary guarantor is designated as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”,
• upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
4.5 % Notes, or • if such subsidiary guarantor has been released from its guarantees of indebtedness under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan and all capital markets debt securities Covenants 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility —Our 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan impose restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to pay cash dividends, incur debt or liens, redeem or repurchase Vista Outdoor stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments, merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets. Each of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan contains a financial covenant which requires that Excess Availability under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility cannot fall below the greater of (a)
10 % of the line cap or (b) $ 57,000 . As a result of this financial covenant, we must maintain Excess Availability of at least the greater of
10 % of the line cap or $ 57,000
at all times in order to satisfy the financial covenant. In addition, as long as the 2022 Term Loan remains outstanding, we also must maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of
3.00 :1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 25, 2022, the consolidated leverage ratio was
1.71 . Each of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2022 Term Loan includes a covenant that prohibits the spin-off of any line of business of Vista Outdoor or certain of its subsidiaries, including the expected separation of our Outdoor Products segment (the “Planned Separation”), and amendment of each such covenant will require the consent of all lenders under the applicable credit facility in order to permit the Planned Separation. Vista Outdoor anticipates that each of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2022 Term Loan will be repaid or refinanced in full prior to or upon the consummation of the Planned Separation. If we do not comply with the covenants in the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility or 2022 Term Loan, the lenders under the applicable facility may, subject to customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under such facility. As noted above, the Excess Availability less the minimum required borrowing base under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility was $ 109,555
as of December 25, 2022. Vista Outdoor has the option to increase the amount of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 150,000 , to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.
4.5 %
Notes —The indenture governing the
4.5 % Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur or permit to exist certain liens, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt and make loans and investments.
The 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the 2022 Term Loan, and the indenture governing the
4.5 % Notes contain cross-default provisions so that noncompliance with the covenants within one debt agreement could also cause a default under the other debt agreement. As of December 25, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt agreements. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with such financial covenants in the future due to various risks and uncertainties, some of which may be beyond our control. Any failure to comply with the restrictions in the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan may prevent us from drawing under these loans and may result in an event of default under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan, which default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and the indebtedness under our
4.5 % Notes and proceed against the collateral that secures such indebtedness. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the indebtedness in such circumstances.
Cash paid for interest on debt, for the three months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 totaled $ 11,800
and $ 792 , respectively. Cash paid for interest on debt, for the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 totaled $ 25,011
and $ 12,992 , respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans
We recognized an aggregate net loss (benefit) of $ 382
and $( 293 ) for employee defined benefit plans during the three months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. 21 Table of Contents We recognized an aggregate net loss (benefit) of $ 1,144
and $( 255 ) for employee defined benefit plans during the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. Employer contributions and distributions —We made contributions of $ 0
and $ 1,300
to our pension trust during the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.
No
additional contributions are required and we are not expecting to make any contributions to our pension trust for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. For those same periods, we made
no
contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans, and we made
no
distributions to retirees under our non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan.
No
additional contributions are required, and we are not expecting to make any contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans, or directly to retirees under our non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. 15.
Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, and state income taxes. Income tax provisions for interim periods are based on the estimated effective annual income tax rates for the current year and the prior year. The income tax provisions for the three months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 represent effective tax rates of
16.9 % and
22.4 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year quarter is primarily driven by the true-up of prior year taxes and the non-taxable contingent consideration income. The income tax provisions for the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 represent effective tax rates of
21.5 % and
24.1 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year period is primarily driven by the true-up of prior year taxes and the non-taxable contingent consideration income. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 25, 2022 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% due to state taxes and the beneficial impact of the prior year tax return filings and non-taxable contingent consideration income. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 26, 2021 is reflective of the federal statutory rate of 21% increased by the state taxes and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, totaled $ 69,708
and $ 114,864
for the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. We have filed amended income tax returns requesting total refunds of $ 42,193 , which are reflected in our income tax receivable of $ 41,415 . We have classified uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, amounted to $ 30,639
and $ 24,719
as of December 25, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Although the timing and outcome of income tax audit settlements are uncertain, it is expected that a $ 9,215
reduction of the liability for uncertain tax benefits will occur in the next 12 months. The settlement of these unrecognized tax benefits could result in earnings from $ 0
to $ 8,403 . 16.
Contingencies
Litigation From time-to-time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. We do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Environmental liabilities Our operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. We are obligated to conduct investigation and/or remediation activities at certain sites that we own or operate or formerly owned or operated. Certain of our former subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs"), along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, those former subsidiaries may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites. In that event, we would be obligated to indemnify those subsidiaries for those costs. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the
22 Table of Contents aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We have recorded a liability for environmental remediation of $ 682
and $ 697
as of December 25, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
We could incur substantial additional costs, including cleanup costs, resource restoration, fines, and penalties or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits. While environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and we have environmental management programs in place to mitigate these risks, it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future. 17.
Operating Segment Information
Our business is comprised of
eight
operating segments, which have been aggregated into
two
reportable segments, Sporting Products and Outdoor Products. This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), our Chief Executive Officer, allocates resources and makes decisions. Our Ammunition operating segment is in its own reportable segment which has been named Sporting Products. We aggregate our Outdoor Accessories, Sports Protection, Outdoor Cooking, Hydration, Golf, Fishing, and Cycling operating segments into the Outdoor Products reportable segment. The operating segments comprising our respective reportable segments share numerous commonalities, including similar core consumers, distribution channels, and supply chains. Our CODM relies on internal management reporting that analyzes consolidated results to the net income level and our operating segment's EBIT, which is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes. Certain corporate-related costs and other non-recurring costs are not allocated to the segments in order to present comparable results from period to period and are not utilized by management in determining segment profitability. Our Sporting Products and Outdoor Products reportable segments generated approximately
57 % and
43 %, respectively, of our external sales in the nine months ended December 25, 2022. No single customer contributed 10% or more of our sales in the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by law. Business and Products We serve the outdoor sports and recreation markets through a diverse portfolio of well-recognized brands that provide consumers with a wide range of performance-driven, high-quality, and innovative products.

We anticipate that the transaction will be in the form of a distribution to our shareholders of 100% of the stock of Outdoor Products, which will become a new, independent publicly traded company. The distribution is intended to be tax-free to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We currently expect the transaction will be completed in calendar year 2023, subject to final approval by our Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, our receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed. We expect that the Planned Separation will create a number of benefits for Outdoor Products and Sporting Products, including: • Enhanced strategic focus with supporting resources: Each company will have enhanced strategic focus with resources to support its specific operational needs and growth drivers. • Tailored capital allocation priorities: Each company will have a tailored capital allocation philosophy that is better suited to support its distinctive business model and long-term goals. • Strengthened ability to attract and retain top talent: Each company will benefit from enhanced ability to attract and retain top talent that is ideally suited to execute its strategic and operational objectives. • Compelling value for shareholders: Each company will present a differentiated and compelling investment opportunity based on its particular business model. • Expanded strategic opportunities: Improved focus will allow Outdoor Products to further cement its reputation as the acquirer of choice through continued M&A in the outdoor recreation products marketplace and enable Sporting Products to secure attractive partnerships with other manufacturers. Executive Summary Financial highlights and notable events for the three months ended December 25, 2022 included the following: • Net sales decreased $39,879, or 5.0%, over the comparable quarter last year.
◦
Sporting Products net sales decreased $58,142, or 12.6%.
◦
Outdoor Products net sales increased $18,263, or 5.5%. • Gross profit decreased $42,664, or 15.2%, as compared to the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit margin decreased to 31.6%, a decrease of 380 basis points over the comparable quarter last year.
◦
Sporting Products gross profit decreased $36,603, or 20.6%.
◦
Outdoor Products gross profit decreased $2,259, or 2.2%.

EBIT margin decreased to 12.9%, a decrease of 710 basis points over the comparable quarter last year. • Net income decreased to $65,147, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $118,137, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. Sporting Products Industry Sales of hunting and shooting-sports related products, including ammunition, are heavily influenced by hunting and recreational shooting participation rates, civil unrest and the political environment. We believe that long-term participation trends support our expectation of continued increased demand for hunting and shooting-sports related products. Participation rates have remained strong, and we are seeing an expanded demographic of users. This broadened end consumer base has resulted in a much larger total addressable market opportunity for the industry and for our company. We believe we are well-positioned to succeed and capitalize on this demand given our scale and global operating platform, which we believe is particularly difficult to replicate in the highly regulated and capital-intensive ammunition manufacturing sector. Outdoor Recreation Industry
We believe that long-term outdoor participation trends combined with a larger base of participants supports our expectation of continued increased demand for the innovative outdoor recreation-related products produced by our Outdoor
27 Table of Contents Products brands. We believe that demand for our Outdoor Products is being temporarily impacted by higher inflation causing a contraction in disposable income. Rising inflation and the absence of stimulus payments have had an impact on the opening price points of certain categories. However, outdoor participation trends and demand for premium price points remain strong across our brand portfolio. Our Outdoor Products brands hold a strong competitive position in the marketplace, and we intend to further differentiate our brands through focused research and development and marketing investments including increased use of social media and other digital marketing. Following significant investments in our brands’ e-commerce capabilities, both directly and through our E-Commerce Center of Excellence, we believe our brands are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift in consumer shopping behavior to utilize online channels. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on results of operations, our financial condition, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Income Taxes , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details regarding income taxes. The decrease in the effective rate for the three and nine months ended December 25, 2022 in relation to the comparable prior year periods is primarily driven by the true-up of prior year taxes and the non-taxable contingent consideration income. Financial condition Cash increased to $77,426 at December 25, 2022 compared to $22,584 at March 31, 2022, primarily due to cash provided by advances on the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan, and cash provided by operating activities, which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions completed during this fiscal year. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased by $88,050 in the nine months ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the timing of payments by customers, decreased payments for inventory, and decreased income tax payments as compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by increased payments for incentive compensation and timing of payments to vendors. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities increased by $233,658 for the nine months ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of businesses during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities increased by $404,260 for the nine months ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year period. The increase primarily relates to proceeds from the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan and a reduction in the repurchase of treasury shares, partially offset by increased payments on our credit facilities and increased payments for debt issuance costs, as compared to the prior year period. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements are to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, employee benefit obligations, share repurchases, earn-outs related to previous acquisitions, and any strategic acquisitions. Our short-term cash requirements for operations are expected to consist mainly of capital expenditures to maintain production facilities and working capital requirements. Our debt service requirements over the next two years consist of required interest payments due under our 4.5% Notes, 2022 Term Loan and 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and principal prepayments due under the 2022 Term Loan. Each of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2022 Term Loan includes a covenant that prohibits the spin-off of any line of business of Vista Outdoor or certain of its subsidiaries, including the expected separation of our Outdoor Products segment (the “Planned Separation”), and amendment of each such covenant will require the consent of all lenders under the applicable credit facility in order to permit the Planned Separation. We anticipate that each of the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2022 Term Loan will be repaid or refinanced in full prior to or upon the consummation of the Planned Separation. Based on our current financial condition, management believes that our cash position, combined with anticipated generation of cash flows and the availability of funding, if needed, under our 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, access to debt and equity markets, as well as other potential sources of funding including additional bank financing, will be adequate to fund future growth to service our currently anticipated long-term debt and pension obligations, make capital expenditures, pay earn-outs related to previous acquisitions, and fund the 2022 Share Repurchase Program over the next 12 months. As of December 25, 2022, based on the borrowing base less outstanding borrowings of $415,000, outstanding letters of credit of $15,445, and the minimum required borrowing base of $60,000, the amount available under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility was $109,555. Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and stockholders' equity) was 46.4% as of December 25, 2022.
There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions, including any disruptions to capital markets caused by COVID-19 pandemic (including the
30 Table of Contents emergence and spread of vaccine resistant coronavirus variants), the war in Ukraine and imposition of sanctions on Russia, or our future financial condition and performance. Furthermore, because our 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured in large part by receivables from our customers, a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence and spread of vaccine resistant coronavirus variants) or the war in Ukraine and imposition of sanctions on Russia, that adversely affects the creditworthiness of our customers could have a negative effect on our future available liquidity under the 2022 ABL Revolving Credit Facility Additional information about our long-term debt is presented in Note 13,
Long-term Debt , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We lease certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. As of December 25, 2022, current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $16,612 and $94,845, respectively, were recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion on minimum lease payment obligations, see Note 3,
Leases,
to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. Except as discussed in Note 13,
Long-term Debt,
to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and under Liquidity and Capital Resources above, there have been no material changes with respect to the contractual obligations and commitments or off-balance sheet arrangements described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022. Contingencies Litigation From time-to-time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. We do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Environmental Liabilities Our operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. We are obligated to conduct investigations and/or remediation activities at certain sites that we own or operate or formerly owned or operated. Certain of our former subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs"), along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, those former subsidiaries may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites. In that event, we would be obligated to indemnify those subsidiaries for those costs. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect that these potential liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.
We could incur substantial additional costs, including cleanup costs, resource restoration, fines, and penalties or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits. While environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and we have environmental management programs in place to mitigate these risks, it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022.
Dependence on Key Customers; Concentration of Credit No single customer contributed 10% or more of our sales in the nine months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. 31 Table of Contents If a key customer fails to meet payment obligations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Inflation and Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to inflationary factors such as increases in labor, supplier, logistics and overhead costs that may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses, if the selling prices of our products are not able to offset these increased costs. Additionally, inflation may potentially impact demand as consumers reduce discretionary spending.
We have been impacted by changes in the prices of raw materials used in production as well as changes in oil and energy costs. In particular, the prices of commodity metals, such as copper, zinc, and lead continue to be volatile. These prices generally impact our Sporting Products Segment. See Note 5,
Derivative Financial Instruments,
to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. We have a strategic sourcing, pricing and hedging strategy to mitigate risk from commodity price fluctuation. We will continue to evaluate the need for future price changes in light of these trends, our competitive landscape, and our financial results. If our sourcing and pricing strategy is unable to offset impacts of the commodity price fluctuations, our future results from operations and cash flows would be materially impacted. ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Fluctuations We are exposed to interest rate risk from our credit facilities. A significant portion of our indebtedness consists of borrowings with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities accrue interest as described in Note 13,
Long-term Debt,
in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, and in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Assuming $730 million of variable-rate indebtedness, a change of 1/2 of one percent in interest rates would result in a $3.7 million change over the 12-month period ending December 26, 2023. To mitigate the risks from interest rate exposure, we may enter into hedging transactions, mainly interest rate swaps, through derivative financial instruments that have been authorized pursuant to corporate policies. Our objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow.
We measure market risk related to holdings of financial instruments based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values, cash flows, and earnings based on a hypothetical change (increase and decrease) in interest rates. We used current market rates on the debt portfolio to perform the sensitivity analysis. Certain items such as lease contracts, insurance contracts, and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits were not included in the analysis. Foreign Currency Fluctuations We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, the British pound, and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. To mitigate the risks from foreign currency exposure, we enter into hedging transactions, mainly foreign currency forward contracts, through derivative financial instruments that have been authorized pursuant to corporate policies. In addition, the remeasurement of certain balance sheet payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies, as well as gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of our international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. We use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Note 5,

in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 25, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 25, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Fox Racing. Prior to the acquisition, Fox Racing was a privately-held company and was not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC, or other corporate governance requirements applicable to public reporting companies. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are continuing to incorporate our controls and procedures into Fox Racing and to augment our company-wide controls to reflect the risks that may be inherent in acquisitions of privately-held companies of this magnitude.
During the nine months ended December 25, 2022, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 33 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. We do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Certain of our former subsidiaries have been identified as PRPs, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, those former subsidiaries may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites. In that event, we would be obligated to indemnify those subsidiaries for those costs. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.
ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 describes the known material risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, projected results, and future prospects. There are no material changes from the disclosure provided in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 with respect to the Risk Factors, other than the addition of the Risk Factor below. Recent changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, results of operations and the price of our common stock, and we may not successfully manage the transition associated with the resignations of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer. On October 21, 2022, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi provided the Board with notice of his decision to resign from the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company to pursue another opportunity. Mr. Priyadarshi continued with the Company through the release of the Company’s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and departed in November 2022. In connection therewith, the Board appointed Andrew Keegan, previously the Company’s Vice President of Finance and Treasury, to serve as the Company’s interim Chief Financial Officer. On February 2, 2023, the Board announced that Christopher T. Metz resigned, effective as of February 1, 2023, from his position as Chief Executive Officer at the request of the Board, based on the Board’s loss of confidence in his leadership for reasons not involving financial reporting or internal controls. In connection therewith, the Board appointed Gary L. McArthur, previously an independent member of the Board, to serve as interim Chief Executive Officer. The Board has undertaken a search to identify a permanent Chief Financial Officer and a permanent Chief Executive Officer. These changes to our executive management team and Board may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, results of operations and the price of our common stock. Leadership transitions are inherently difficult to manage and may result in the loss of institutional knowledge and changes to business strategy or objectives. In addition, these changes have the potential to negatively impact our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to increased or unanticipated expenses, operational inefficiencies, uncertainty regarding changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity and increased turnover.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualified candidates to become the permanent Chief Financial Officer and permanent Chief Executive Officer in a timely manner, our financial performance and ability to meet operational goals and strategic plans may be adversely impacted. The interim nature of our current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer may also distract our employees and management team and lead to attrition of qualified employees, increasing our hiring and retention risks.
