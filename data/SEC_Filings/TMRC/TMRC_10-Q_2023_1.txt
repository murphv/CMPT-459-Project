GENERAL
Exploration-Stage
Company
Since
January 1, 2009, the Company has been classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Item 1300 of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Under Item 1300, companies engaged in significant mining operations
are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production. Exploration
stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Item 1300. Such companies are deemed to
be “in the search for mineral deposits.” Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type
activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company
unless it has established reserves in accordance with Item 1300.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (“we”, “us”,
“our”, the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in our annual report on Form 10-K, for the year
ended August 31, 2022, dated November 29, 2022 as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the
interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 as reported in our annual
report on Form 10-K, have been omitted.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Texas Mineral Resources Corp and its proportionate interest in the assets,
liabilities, and operations of Round Top Mountain Development Company, LLC (“RTMD”). All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Going
Concern
These
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated
deficit from inception through November 30, 2022, of approximately $ 40,320,000
and has yet to achieve profitable operations, and
projects further losses in the development of its business.
At
November 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital surplus of approximately $ 2,156,000 , however the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company doesn’t expect to generate revenue
from operations in the near future.
In
accordance with our current projected budget, the Company does not have sufficient capital to fund its share of total cash calls
required under the RTMD agreement and expected general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023.
Failure by the Company to make required cash calls to Round Top would result in significant dilution to its
20 %
ownership interest. Accordingly, the Company will be required to raise additional capital to fund its obligations during the fiscal
year ending August 31, 2023. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital to fund its cash
calls and expected general and administrative expenses. No cash calls were required in December 2022 and January 2023 and we have
been notified by USARE that there will not be a cash call in February 2023 or March 2023. The Company
may also seek to obtain short-term loans from the directors of the Company. Based on these factors, there is substantial doubt as to
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of these financial
statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities
that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2020-06,
Debt – Debit with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts
in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own
Equity.
This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current
U.S. GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument and more convertible
preferred stock as a single equity instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain
settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit
more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculation
in certain areas. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. Management
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.
NOTE

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS
The
Company accounts for its interest in RTMD using the proportionate consolidation method, which is an exception available to entities
in the extractive industries, thereby recognizing its pro-rata share of the assets, liabilities, and operations of RTMD in the
appropriate classifications in the financial statements.

August
2010 Lease
On
August 17, 2010, the Company executed a new mining lease with the Texas General Land Office covering Sections 7 and 18 of Township
7, Block 71 and Section 12 of Block 72, covering approximately
860
acres at Round Top Mountain in Hudspeth County, Texas. The
mining lease issued by the Texas General Land Office gives the Company the right to explore, produce, develop, mine, extract,
mill, remove, and market rare earth elements, all other base and precious metals, industrial minerals and construction materials
and all other minerals excluding oil, gas, coal, lignite, sulfur, salt, and potash. The term of the lease is nineteen years so
long as minerals are produced in paying quantities.
Under
the terms of the lease, the Company is obligated to pay the State of Texas a total lease bonus of $ 142,518 . The Company paid $ 44,718
upon the execution of the lease, and Round Top will pay the remaining $ 97,800
upon submission of a supplemental plan of operations
to conduct mining. Upon the sale of any minerals removed from the Round Top Project, Round Top will pay the State of Texas a $ 500,000
minimum advance royalty. Thereafter, if paying quantities of minerals are obtained, Round Top will pay the State of Texas a production
royalty equal to
eight
percent of the market value of uranium and other fissionable materials removed and sold from the Round
Top Project and
six and one quarter
percent of the market value of all other minerals removed and sold. If paying quantities have
not been obtained, Round Top may pay additional delay rental fees to extend the term of the lease for successive one ( 1 ) year
periods pursuant to the following schedule:

August 2022, our joint venture partner paid the State of Texas a delay rental to extend the term of the lease in an amount equal
to $ 13,500 .
March
2013 Lease
On
March 6, 2013, the Company purchased the surface lease at the Round Top Project, known as the West Lease, from the Southwest Wildlife
and Range Foundation (since renamed the Rio Grande Foundation) for $ 500,000
cash and
1,063,830
shares of common stock valued at
$ 500,000 . The Company also agreed to support the Foundation through an annual payment of $ 45,000
for
ten years
to support conservation
efforts within the Rio Grande Basin, particularly Lake Amistad, a large and well-known fishing lake near Del Rio, Texas. The West
Lease comprises approximately
54,990
acres. Most importantly, the purchase of the surface lease provides the Company unrestricted
surface access for the potential development and mining of the Round Top Project.
October
2014 Surface Option and Water Lease
On
October 29, 2014, the Company announced the execution of agreements with the Texas General Land Office securing the option to
purchase the surface rights covering the potential Round Top project mine and plant areas and, separately, a lease to develop
the water necessary for the potential Round Top Project mine operations. The option to purchase the surface rights covers approximately
5,670
acres over the mining lease and the additional acreage adequate to site all potential heap leaching and processing operations
as currently anticipated by the Company. Round
Top
may exercise the option for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the
sixteen-year
primary term of the mineral
lease. The option can be maintained through annual payments of $ 10,000 . The purchase price will be the appraised value of the
surface at the time of option exercise. All annual payments have been made as of the date of this filing.
The
ground water lease secures the right to develop the ground water within a
13,120 -acre lease area located approximately
4
miles
from the Round Top deposit. The lease area contains
five
existing water wells. It is anticipated that all potential water needs
for the Round Top project mine operations would be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease terms
include an annual minimum production payment of $ 5,000
prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production
Round Top will pay $ 0.95
per thousand gallons or $ 20,000
annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains in effect so long
as the mineral lease is in effect.
Santa
Fe Gold Corporation
In
November 2021, the Company entered into a mineral exploration and option agreement with Santa Fe Gold Corporation (“Santa
Fe”). Under the option agreement, the Company and Santa Fe plan to pursue, negotiate and subsequently enter into a joint
venture agreement to jointly explore and develop a target silver property to be selected by the Company among patented and unpatented
mining claims held by Santa Fe within the Black Hawk Mining District in Grant County, New Mexico. Completion of a joint venture
agreement, if any, is subject to the successful outcome of a multi-phase exploration plan leading to a bankable feasibility study
to be undertaken in the near future by the Company. Under the contemplated terms of the proposed joint venture agreement, the
Company would be project operator and initially own  50.5 % of the joint venture while Santa Fe would initially own  49.5 %.
Additional terms of the joint venture are expected to be negotiated between the Company and Santa Fe in the future.

(Unaudited)
Under
the terms of the option agreement, the Company plans to conduct a district-wide evaluation among the patented and unpatented claims
held by Santa Fe, consisting of geologic mapping, sampling, trenching, radiometric surveying, geophysics, drilling and/or other
methods as warranted. Based on the district-wide evaluation, the Company will designate one  80 -acre tract as the “project
area” and commence detailed exploration work. The property covered in the option agreement is approximately  1,300  acres
and covers approximately  75 % of the known mining district. The area to be studied also includes a  two -mile radius “area
of interest.” The option agreement provides the Company with the right to designate any properties within the “area
of interest” as “project area” properties. The term of the option is for so long as the Company continues to
conduct exploration activities in the Project Area and can be exercised on  60  days’ notice to Santa Fe.

This
list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the Company’s forward-looking statements. Some of the important risks
and uncertainties that could affect forward-looking statements are described further under the section headings “Risk Factors”
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly
Report. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated
or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. The Company cautions readers not to
place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law,
the Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  We qualify all
the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report by the foregoing cautionary statements.
In
light of these risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in greater detail elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, there
can be no assurance that the events predicted in forward-looking statements contained in the Quarterly Report will in fact transpire.
An
investment in our Common Stock involves significant risks, including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described herein before purchasing our Common Stock. The risks set forth herein
are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist and others could arise that could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition, operations and prospects. If any of the risks set forth herein actually materialize,
our business, financial condition, prospects and operations would suffer. In such event, the value of our Common Stock would decline,
and you could lose all or a substantial portion of your investment.
Going
Concern
These
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated
deficit from inception through November 30, 2022, of approximately $40,320,000 and has yet to achieve profitable operations, and
projects further losses in the development of its business.
12
At
November 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital surplus of approximately $2,156,000, however the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due.
In
accordance with our current projected budget, the Company does not have sufficient capital to fund its total cash calls and expected
general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. Failure by the Company to make required cash
calls to Round Top would result in significant dilution to its 20% ownership interest. Accordingly, the Company will be required
to raise additional capital to fund its obligations during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023 as well as during the quarter
ending November 30, 2023. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital to fund its cash
calls and expected general and administrative expenses. No cash calls were required in December 2022 and January 2023 and we have
been notified by USARE that there will not be a cash call in February or March 2023. Based on these factors, there is substantial
doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of
these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets
and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Overview
We
are a mining company engaged in the business of the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We currently
own a 20% membership interest in RTMD, which entity holds two mineral property leases with the Texas General Land Office to explore
and develop a 950-acre rare earths project located in Hudspeth County, Texas, known as the Round Top Project. The leases, originally
signed with primary terms of approximately 19 and 18 years, each currently have remaining terms of approximately eight years and
provisions for automatic renewal if Round Top is in production. RTMD also holds prospecting permits covering 9,345 acres adjacent
to the Round Top Project. The strategy of RTMD is to develop a metallurgical process to concentrate or otherwise extract the metals
from the Round Top Project’s rhyolite, conduct additional engineering, design, geotechnical work, and permitting necessary
for a bankable feasibility study and then to extract mineral resources from the Round Top Project. The Round Top Project has not
established as of the date hereof that any of the properties contain any probable mineral reserves or proven mineral reserves
under Item 1300 of Regulation S-K.
Rare
earth elements (“REE”) are a group of chemically similar elements that usually are found together in nature –
they are referred to as the “lanthanide series.” These individual elements have a variety of characteristics that
are critical in a wide range of technologies, products, and applications and are critical inputs in existing and emerging applications.
Without these elements, multiple high-tech technologies would not be possible. These technologies include:
●
cell phones,
●
computer and television
screens,
●
electric vehicles,
●
clean energy technologies,
such as hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power turbines,
●
fiber optics, lasers
and hard disk drives,
●
numerous defense
applications, such as guidance and control systems and global positioning systems,
●
advanced water treatment
technology for use in industrial, military and
●
outdoor recreation applications
Because
of these applications, global demand for REE is projected to steadily increase due to continuing growth in existing applications
and increased innovation and development of new end uses. Interest in developing resources domestically has become a strategic
necessity as there is limited production of these elements outside of China. Our ability to raise additional funds to continue
to fund our participation interest in the Round Top Project may be impacted by future prices for REEs.
USA
Rare Earth Agreement
In
August 2018, the Company and Morzev Pty. Ltd. (“Morzev”) entered into an agreement (the “2018 Option Agreement”)
whereby Morzev was granted the exclusive right to earn and acquire a 70% interest in the Company’s Round Top Project by
financing $10 million of expenditures in connection with the Project, increasable to an 80% interest for an additional $3 million
payment to the Company. Morzev began operating as USA Rare Earth, LLC (“USARE”) and in May 2019 notified the Company
that it was nominating USARE as the optionee under the terms of the 2018 Option Agreement. In August 2019, the Company and USARE
entered into an amended and restated option agreement as further amended on June 29, 2020 (the “2019 Option Agreement”
and collectively with the 2018 Option Agreement, the “Option Agreement”), whereby the Company restated its agreement
to grant USARE the exclusive right to earn and acquire a 70% interest, increasable to an 80% interest, in the Round Top Project.
The 2019 Option Agreement has substantially similar terms to the 2018 Option Agreement:
On
May 17, 2021, and in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement, the Company and USARE entered into a contribution agreement
(“Contribution Agreement”) whereby the Company and USARE contributed assets to Round Top Mountain Development (“RTMD”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for their ownership interests in RTMD, of which the Company now owns membership
interests equating to 20% of RTMD and USARE owns membership interests equating to 80% of RTMD. Concurrently therewith, the Company
and USARE as the two members entered into a limited liability company agreement (“Operating Agreement”) governing
the operations of RTMD which contains customary and industry standard terms as contemplated by the Option Agreement. USARE will
serve as manager of RTMD and Mr. Gorski, on behalf of the Company, will serve as one of the three members of the management committee.
13
In
connection with USARE meeting its obligations to acquire a 70% interest in the Round Top Project and exercising its right to an
additional 10% interest, the Company received total consideration of approximately $3,728,000, consisting of the $3 million upon
exercise of the option and approximately $728,000 in previous advances to the Company by USARE, and derecognized 80% of the carrying
amount of mineral properties, or approximately $402,000. The resulting gain on sale of interest in mineral properties in the amount
of approximately $3,326,000 was recognized during the quarter ended May 31, 2021.
Upon
entry into the Contribution Agreement, the Company assigned the following contracts and assets to RTMD in exchange for its 20%
membership interest in RTMD:
●
the assignment and
assumption agreement with respect to the mineral leases from the Company to RTMD;
●
the assignment and
assumption agreement with respect to the surface lease from the Company to RTMD;
●
the assignment and
assumption agreement with respect to the surface purchase option from the Company to RTMD;
●
the assignment and
assumption agreement with respect to the water lease from the Company to RTMD; and
●
the bill of sale and assignment agreement of
existing data with respect to RTMD owned by the Company.
and
USARE assigned the following assets to RTMD (or the Company, as applicable) for its 80% membership interest in RTMD:
●
cash
to RTMD to continue to fund Round Top Project operations in the amount of approximately $3,761,750 comprising the balance
of the $10 million required expenditure to earn a 70% interest in RTMD;
●
cash in the amount
of $3 million to the Company upon exercise of the USARE option to acquire from the Company an additional 10% interest in RTMD,
resulting in the aggregate ownership interest of 80% in RTMD;
●
bill of sale and
assignment agreement of the Pilot Plant to RTMD;
●
the assignment and
assumption regarding relevant contracts and permits with respect to RTMD; and
●
bill of sale and
assignment agreement of existing data and intellectual property owned by USARE to RTMD.
The
Company accounts for its interest in RTMD using the proportionate consolidation method, which is an exception available to entities
in the extractive industries, thereby recognizing its pro-rate share of the assets, liabilities, and operations of RTMD in the
appropriate classifications in the financial statements.
Santa
Fe Project
In
November 2021, the Company entered into a mineral exploration and option agreement with Santa Fe Gold Corporation (“Santa
Fe”). Under the option agreement, the Company and Santa Fe plan to pursue, negotiate and subsequently enter into a joint
venture agreement to jointly explore and develop a target silver property to be selected by the Company among patented and unpatented
mining claims held by Santa Fe within the Black Hawk Mining District in Grant County, New Mexico. Completion of a joint venture
agreement, if any, is subject to the successful outcome of a multi-phase exploration plan leading to a bankable feasibility study
to be undertaken in the near future by the Company. Under the contemplated terms of the proposed joint venture agreement, the
Company would be project operator and initially own 50.5% of the joint venture while Santa Fe would initially own 49.5%.
Additional terms of the joint venture are expected to be negotiated between the Company and Santa Fe in the future.
Under
the terms of the option agreement, the Company plans to conduct a district-wide evaluation among the patented and unpatented claims
held by Santa Fe, consisting of geologic mapping, sampling, trenching, radiometric surveying, geophysics, drilling and/or other
methods as warranted. Based on the district-wide evaluation, the Company will designate one 80-acre tract as the “project
area” and commence detailed exploration work. The property covered in the option agreement is approximately 1,300 acres
and covers approximately 75% of the known mining district. The area to be studied also includes a two-mile radius “area
of interest.” The option agreement provides the Company with the right to designate any properties within the “area
of interest” as “project area” properties. The term of the option is for so long as the Company continues to
conduct exploration activities in the Project Area and can be exercised on 60 days’ notice to Santa Fe.
Additionally,
in November 2021, the Company entered into a financing and purchase option agreement with Greentech Minerals Holdings, Inc. (“Greentech”);
however, Greentech determined not to pursue this financing option. The Company is currently pursuing other financing sources.
There
can be no assurance any joint venture agreement or financing agreement will be consummated or that this project will materialize.
14
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
At
November 30, 2022, our accumulated deficit was approximately $40,320,000 and our cash position was approximately $1,844,000. We
had a working capital surplus of approximately $2,156,000. Round Top has not commenced commercial production on the Round Top
Project. We have no revenues from operations and anticipate we will have no operating revenues until we place one or more of our
properties into production. All properties are in the exploration stage.
During
the fiscal year ending August 31, 2022 and the quarter ended November 30, 2022, we funded approximately $1,937,000 and $386,000,
respectively, to Round Top pursuant to our funding obligations set forth in the Operating Agreement. USARE funded approximately
$8,402,000 and $1,545,600, respectively, in connection with advancing the Round Top Project.
During
the current fiscal year, Round Top is expected to fund the expenditure of approximately $77.1 million to optimize the leaching
and developing of the CIX/CIC processing of the Round Top Project. Initial process design work will be carried out at USARE’s
facility in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Pending completion of the initial process development, this facility will either be relocated
to or replicated at the Round Top Project where a pilot plant is expected to be established. This work will consist of mining
and crushing approximately 40,000 tonnes of rhyolite and setting up and equipping a facility to conduct pilot plant scale heap
leaching. It is estimated that the Round Top Project will require additional time and further expenditure to complete a bankable
feasibility study. Our funding requirement is planned to be approximately $15.4 million of the expected expenditures by Round
Top during our current fiscal year, of which we funded approximately $386,000 during the quarter ended November 2022. No cash
calls were required in December 2022 and January 2023 and we have been notified by USARE that there will not be a cash call in
February or March 2023.
We
do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our portion of the Round Top Budget during our current fiscal year. Therefore, we
will need to raise additional funding to implement our business strategy and to continue to fund our portion of the Round Top
Budget, the failure of which would result in dilution of our ownership interest in RTMD (which could be significant) and could
further cause us to curtail or cease our operations. The most likely source of future financing presently available to us is through
the sale of our securities. Any sale of our shares of Common Stock will result in dilution of equity ownership to existing stockholders.
This means that if we sell shares of Common Stock, more shares will be outstanding and each existing stockholder will own a smaller
percentage of the shares then outstanding. Alternatively, we may rely on debt financing and assume debt obligations that require
us to make substantial interest and capital payments. Also, we may issue or grant warrants or options in the future pursuant to
which additional shares of Common Stock may be issued. Exercise of such warrants or options will result in dilution of equity
ownership to our existing stockholders. We have no firm commitment with respect to obtaining debt or equity financing and, accordingly,
we will be reliant upon a best efforts financing strategy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise necessary
capital to fund our portion of the Round Top Budget and our general administrative expenses during the fiscal year ending August
31, 2023.

Investment
Company Act Exclusion
Section
3(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), provides that a company “substantially
all of whose business consists of owning or holding oil, gas, or other mineral royalties or leases, or fractional interests therein,
or certificates of interest or participation in or investment contracts relative to such royalties, leases, or fractional interests”
is not an investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Company has determined that this exemption applies to it
giving consideration to the following four factors:
●
whether the exempted
activity constitutes “substantially all” of our business;
○
The Company has
owned mineral leases since 2010, all of our business to date has been comprised of owning and developing the mineral leases
and, after the May 2021 “farm-down” of its 100% interest in the mineral leases, all of our business continues
to be comprised of owning and holding a certificate of interest and a participation in the mineral leases owned by RTMD. The
Company’s mineral assets historically, as well as the value of the certificate of interest at November 30, 2022, have
been booked at cost in accordance with GAAP. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $40.4 million at November 30,
2022 as a result of owning and developing the Round Top Project.

The Company has
owned the mineral leases, which are now owned by RTMD, since 2010 and neither the Company nor RTMD is in the business of dealing
or trading in the mineral leases.

what qualifies as
an eligible asset for purposes of the exception; and
○
The statute specifically
references mineral leases and our mineral leases were owned by the Company and are now owned by RTMD. In accordance with Regulation
S-K Item 1300 that governs disclosure by registrants engaged in mining operations, the definition of mineral resource is “a
concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust.” Our rare earth elements
and minerals underlying the mineral leases meet that definition, as well as does coal, silver, gold and other material mined
for economic value by registrants involved in mining operations. The SEC staff has recognized that an excepted entity can
also engage in related business activities such as exploring, developing, and operating the eligible assets.
●
what qualifies as
a “certificate of interest or participation in” or an “investment contract relative to” the eligible
assets.
○
The statute allows
a Company to own a “certificate of interest” or “participation in” the mineral leases. The SEC staff
has advised that limited partnership interests and/or similar securities issued by entities that themselves own the leases
constitute “certificate of interest or participation in or investment contracts” related to such leases. The Company’s
20% membership interest in RTMD constitutes a “certificate of interest” and a “participation in” the
mineral leases that are owned by RTMD.
The
Company intends to continue to conduct its business operations in order to continue to be excluded from the definition of an “investment
company” under the 1940 Act.

Critical
Accounting Estimates
Management’s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies.
Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however,
due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On
a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial
statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined
with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management
believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements;

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and
with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and Rule 15d –
15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and in light of the material weakness existing in our internal controls
over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022 (as described in greater detail in our annual report on From 10-K for the year
ended August 31, 2022), the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that: (i) information required to be disclosed
by us in our reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate,
to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
