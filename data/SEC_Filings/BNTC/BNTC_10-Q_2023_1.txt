SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future performance and include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our business strategy, future commercial revenues, market growth, capital requirements, new product introductions, expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Report, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report, the words “could,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “continue,” “predict,” “potential,” “project,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include the following:
•
the success of our plans to develop and potentially commercialize our product candidates;
•
the timing of the initiation and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
the timing and sufficiency of patient enrollment and dosing in any future clinical trials;
•
the timing of the availability of data from clinical trials;
•
the timing and outcome of regulatory filings and approvals;
•
unanticipated delays;
•
sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution requirements;
•
market competition and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace;
•
regulatory developments in the United States of America, France and Canada;
•
the development of novel AAV vectors;
•
the plans of licensees of our technology;
•
the clinical utility and potential attributes and benefits of ddRNAi and our product candidates, including the potential duration of treatment effects and the potential for a “one shot” cure;
•
our dependence on our relationships with collaborators and other third parties;
•
expenses, ongoing losses, future revenue, capital needs and needs for additional financing, and our ability to access additional financing given market conditions and other factors, including our capital structure;
•
our ability to continue as a going concern;
•
our ability to meet the Nasdaq listing standards;
•
the length of time over which we expect our cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to execute on our business plan;
•
our intellectual property position and the duration of our patent portfolio;
•
the impact of local, regional, and national and international economic conditions and events; and
•
the impact of the current
COVID-19
pandemic, the disease caused by the
SARS-CoV-2
virus, which may adversely impact our business and preclinical and future clinical trials;
as well as other risks detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Report and in other reports filed with the SEC. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and important factors currently known by us and our expectations of the future, about which we cannot be certain. We have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report or on the date thereof. Except as required by law we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we, in the future, may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form
10-K,
quarterly reports on Form
10-Q
and current reports on Form
8-K.
All forward-looking statements included herein or in documents incorporated herein by reference are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to elsewhere in this Report.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. Business
Benitec Biopharma Inc. (the “Company”) is a corporation formed under the laws of Delaware, United States of America, on
November 22, 2019
and listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “BNTC”. Benitec Biopharma Inc. is the parent entity of a number of subsidiaries including the previous parent entity Benitec Biopharma Limited (“BBL”). BBL was incorporated under the laws of Australia in 1995 and was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, from 1997 until April 15, 2020. On August 14, 2020, BBL reorganized as a Proprietary Limited company and changed its name to Benitec Biopharma Proprietary Limited. The Company’s business focuses on the development of novel genetic medicines. Our proprietary platform, called
DNA-directed
RNA interference, or ddRNAi, combines RNA interference, or RNAi, with gene therapy to create medicines that facilitate sustained silencing of disease-causing genes.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company completed an organization restructuring as part of the commercial desire to provide a more efficient structure for the future as the Company transitioned its operations to the United States.
The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. References to a particular “fiscal year” are to our fiscal year end June 30 of that calendar year.
The consolidated financial statements of Benitec Biopharma Inc. are presented in United States dollars and consist of Benitec Biopharma Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries:

Basis of Presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q
and Article 8 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation
S-X.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements have been omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results anticipated for the full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Reference is frequently made herein to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). This is the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to
non-governmental
entities.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates and assumptions in the Company’s
6
Table of Contents consolidated financial statements include the estimates of useful lives of property and equipment, valuation of the operating lease liability and
relate d
right-of-use
asset, allowance for uncollectable receivables, foreign currency translation due to certain average exchange rates applied in lieu of spot rates on transaction dates, and accrued research and development expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, reliance on single- source vendors and collaborators, availability of raw materials, patentability of the Company’s products and processes and clinical efficacy and safety of the Company’s products under development, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained or maintained, that any products developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval or that any approved products will be commercially viable. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid technological change and substantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants and other third parties.
Moreover, the current
COVID-19
pandemic, which is impacting worldwide economic activity, poses risks that the Company or its employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented or inhibited from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time which may delay the
start-up
and conduct of the Company’s clinical trials, and negatively impact manufacturing and testing activities performed by third parties. Any significant delays may impact the use and sufficiency of the Company’s existing cash reserves, and the Company may be required to raise additional capital earlier than it had previously planned. The Company may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed, which may result in delays or suspension of its development plans. The extent to which the pandemic will impact the Company’s business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment.
Foreign Currency Translation and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The Company’s functional currency and reporting currency is the United States dollar. BBL’s functional currency is the Australian dollar (AUD). Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Equity transactions are translated at each historical transaction date spot rate. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity as “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as other comprehensive income (loss).
Other comprehensive income for all periods presented consists entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses.
7
Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP using ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
The Company follows accounting guidance for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and at banks, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with financial institutions, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are reflected as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains deposits at federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.
Trade and Other Receivables
As amounts become uncollectible, they will be charged to an allowance and operations in the period when a determination of collectability is made. Any estimates of potentially uncollectible customer accounts receivable will be made based on an analysis of individual customer and historical
write-off
experience. The Company’s analysis includes the age of the receivable account, creditworthiness of the customer and general economic conditions.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; additions, renewals, and improvements are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Software
3 - 4
years
Lab equipment
3 - 7
years
Computer hardware
3 - 5
years
Leasehold improvements
shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
8
Table of Contents
Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the period and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature, they are measured at amortized cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Leases
At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The Company calculates the present value of lease payments using the discount rate implicit in the lease, unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments over the expected lease term. The Company records a corresponding
right-of-use
lease asset based on the lease liability, adjusted for any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs paid to the lessor prior to the lease commencement date.
After lease commencement, the Company measures its leases as follows: (i) the lease liability based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using the discount rate determined at lease commencement; and (ii) the
right-of-use
lease asset based on the remeasured lease liability, adjusted for any unamortized lease incentives received, any unamortized initial direct costs and the cumulative difference between rent expense and amounts paid under the lease agreement. Any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus potential common shares. Stock options, warrants and convertible instruments are considered potential common shares and are included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share using the treasury stock method when their effect is dilutive. Potential common shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share when their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, there were
40,684,965
and
845,159
potential common shares, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company applies judgement in determining whether contracts entered into fall within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). In doing so, management considers the commercial substance of the transaction and how risks and benefits of the contract accrue to the various parties to the contract.
Management has also made the judgement that the grant of the license and transfer of associated
know-how
and materials are accounted for as one performance obligation as they are not considered to be distinct; they are highly interrelated and could not provide benefits to the customer independently from each other. Judgements were made in relation to the transfer of the license and
know-how
and whether this should be recognized over time or a point in time. The point in time has been determined with regard to the point at which the transfer of
know-how
has substantially been completed and the customer has control of the asset and the ability to direct the use of and receive substantially all of the remaining benefits.
Licensing revenues
Revenue from licensees of the Company’s intellectual property reflects the transfer of a right to use the intellectual property as it exists at the point in time in which the license is transferred to the customer. Consideration can be variable and is estimated using the most likely amount method and is constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenue is recognized as or when the performance obligations are satisfied.
9
Table of Contents The Company recognizes contract liabilities for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations and reports these amounts as other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Similarly, if the Company satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the consideration, the Company recognizes either a contract asset or a receivable in its consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether something other than the passage of time is required before the consideration is due.
Royalties
Revenue from licensees of the Company’s intellectual property reflect a right to use the intellectual property as it exists at the point in time in which the license is granted. Where consideration is based on sales of product by the licensee, revenue is recognized when the customer’s subsequent sales of products occur.
Services revenue
Revenue is earned (constrained by variable considerations) from the provision of research and development services to customers. Services revenue is recognized when performance obligations are either satisfied over time or at a point in time. Generally, the provision of research and development services under a contract with a customer will represent satisfaction of a performance obligation over time where the Company retains the right to payment for services performed but not yet completed.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development expenses relate primarily to the cost of conducting clinical and preclinical trials. Preclinical and clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. Estimates have been used in determining the expense liability under certain preclinical and clinical trial contracts where services have been performed but not yet invoiced. Generally, the costs, and therefore estimates, associated with preclinical and clinical trial contracts are based on the number of animal subjects, samples or tissues requiring analyses, patients, drug administration cycles, the type of treatment and the outcome since the length of time before actual amounts can be determined will vary depending on the total samples requiring primary and repeated analyses, the length of the patient cycles and the timing of the invoices by the preclinical and clinical trial partners.
Share-based Compensation Expense
The Company records share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all share-based compensation awarded to employees and
non-employees
to be recorded as an expense over the shorter of the service period or the vesting period. The Company determines employee and
non-employee
share-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to Australia and United States income tax laws. The Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.
For uncertain tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold, the Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-13:
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU represents a significant change in the accounting for credit losses model by requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (CECL). Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The Company has determined that it has met the criteria of a smaller reporting company (“SRC”) as of November 15, 2019. As such, ASU
2019-10:
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Derivatives and Hedging, and Leases: Effective Dates amended the effective date for the Company to be for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will adopt this ASU effective July 1, 2023.
3. Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 10.5  million and $ 9.9  million and used cash of $ 9.9  million and $ 7.6  million in operations, respectively. The Company expects to continue to incur additional operating losses in the foreseeable future.
10
Table of Contents
The Company’s business focuses on the development of novel genetic medicines and, at this stage in the Company’s development, the Company has not established a source of revenue to cover its full operating costs, and as such, is dependent on funding operations through capital financing activities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 10.5  million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has performed a review of its cash flow forecasts and has concluded that substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate revenue and obtain adequate financing. While the Company believes in its ability to generate revenue and raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern due to unsuccessful product development or commercialization, or the inability to obtain adequate financing in the future.

Equity Incentive Plan
Employee Share Option Plan
In connection with its
re-domiciliation
to the United States in April 2020, the Company assumed BBL’s obligations with respect to the settlement of options that were issued by BBL prior to the
re-domiciliation
pursuant to the Benitec Officers’ and Employees’ Share Option Plan (the “Share Option Plan”). This includes the Company’s assumption of the Share Option Plan and all award agreements pursuant to which each of the options were granted. Each option when exercised entitles the option holder to one share in the Company. Options are exercisable on or before an expiry date, do not carry any voting or dividend rights and are not transferable except on death of the option holder or in certain other limited circumstances. Employee options vest
one-third
on each anniversary of the applicable grant date for three years. If an employee dies, retires, or otherwise leaves the Company and certain exercise conditions have been satisfied, generally, the employee has 12 months to exercise their options or the options are cancelled. Since the
re-domiciliation,
no new options have been or will be issued under the Share Option Plan.
Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan
On December 9, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan and, on December 8, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under such plan to 1,850,000 (as amended, the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of various equity awards. Currently, only stock options are issued under the 2020 Plan. Each option when exercised entitles the option holder to one share of the Company’s common stock. Options are exercisable on or before an expiry date, do not carry any voting or dividend rights, and are not transferable except on death of the option holder or in certain other limited circumstances. Employee stock options vest in increments of
one-third
on each anniversary of the applicable grant date for three years.
Non-employee
director options vest in increments of
one-third
on the day prior to each of the Company’s next three annual stockholder meetings following the grant date. If an option holder dies or terminates employment or service due to Disability (as defined in the 2020 Plan) and certain exercise conditions have been satisfied, generally, the option holder has 12 months to exercise their options or the options are cancelled. If an option holder otherwise leaves the Company, other than for a termination by the Company for Cause (as defined in the 2020 Plan) and certain exercise conditions have been satisfied, generally, the option holder has 90 days to ex ercis e their options or the options are cancelled. Future equity grants will be made under the 2020 Plan.

As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 0.3  million of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to stock options issued under the Share Option Plan and the 2020 Plan.
Non-employee option awards-related stock-based compensation expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022 was overstated by $ 167
thousand. The Company determined that this overstatement is immaterial to the previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022 and corrected the amount in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.
10. Income taxes
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company did not recognize a provision or benefit for income taxes as it has incurred net losses. In addition, the net deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses are fully offset by a valuation allowance as the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be realized.
11. Commitments and contingencies Contract commitments
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract research organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations and other service providers and vendors. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and, therefore, are cancellable contracts and not considered contractual obligations and commitments.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may become subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not a party to any material legal proceedings, nor is it aware of any material pending or threatened litigation.
12. Related party transactions
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not enter into any related party transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into a related party transaction with Francis Abourizk Lightowlers for legal fees totaling $ 1  thousand. Peter Francis, a
non-executive
director at the Company, is a partner at Francis Abourizk Lightowlers. As of December 31, 2021 amounts due to this related party of $ 1  thousand were included in trade and other payables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this document.
Overview
We endeavor to become the leader in discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic agents capable of addressing significant unmet medical need via the application of the silence and replace approach to the treatment of genetic disorders.
Benitec Biopharma Inc. (“Benitec” or the “Company” or in the third person, “we” or “our”) is a development-stage biotechnology company focused on the advancement of novel genetic medicines with headquarters in Hayward, California. The proprietary platform, called
DNA-directed
RNA interference, or ddRNAi, combines RNA interference, or RNAi, with gene therapy to create medicines that facilitate sustained silencing of disease- causing genes following a single administration. The Company is developing a ddRNAi-based therapeutic
(BB-301)
for the treatment of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD), a chronic, life-threatening genetic disorder.
BB-301
is a ddRNAi-based genetic medicine currently under development by Benitec.
BB-301
is an AAV-based gene therapy designed to simultaneously silence the expression of the mutant, disease-causing gene (to slow, or halt, the biological mechanisms underlying disease progression in OPMD) and replace the mutant gene with a wild type gene (to drive restoration of function in diseased cells). This fundamental therapeutic approach to disease management is called “silence and replace”. The silence and replace mechanism offers the potential to restore the normative physiology of diseased cells and tissues and to improve treatment outcomes for patients suffering from the chronic, and potentially fatal, effects of OPMD.
BB-301
has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and the European Union.
The targeted gene silencing effects of RNAi, in conjunction with the durable transgene expression achievable via the use of modified viral vectors, imbues the silence and replace approach with the potential to produce long-term silencing of disease-causing genes along with simultaneous replacement of wild type gene function following a single administration of the proprietary genetic medicine. We believe that this novel mechanistic profile of the current and future investigational agents developed by Benitec could facilitate the achievement of robust and durable clinical activity while greatly reducing the frequency of drug administration traditionally expected for medicines employed for the management of chronic diseases.
Additionally, the achievement of long-term gene silencing and gene replacement may significantly reduce the risk of patient
non-compliance
during the course of medical management of potentially fatal clinical disorders.
COVID-19
COVID-19
has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread to nearly every country, including Australia and the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been, and will likely continue to be, extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant disruptions to businesses and capital markets around the world. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and its variants, and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, including the effectiveness and adoption of vaccines for the virus, among others.
Certain elements of our research and development efforts are conducted globally, including the ongoing development of our silence and replace therapeutic for the treatment of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD), and will be dependent upon our ability to complete preclinical studies and initiate clinical studies despite the ongoing
COVID-19
pandemic.
As we endeavor to complete our development programs, including the ongoing Toxicology and Biodistribution study for
BB-301,
we are in close contact with our principal investigators, contract research organizations, and preclinical trial sites, which are located in the United States, Canada, and France, and are assessing the impact of
COVID-19
on our studies and the expected development timelines and costs on an ongoing basis. In light of developments relating to the
COVID-19
global pandemic since the beginning of the outbreak, the focus of healthcare providers and hospitals on fighting the virus, and consistent with the FDA’s industry guidance for conducting clinical trials, we have experienced delays to the original timeline regarding the initiation and anticipated completion of the ongoing
BB-301
Clinical Trial Application (CTA)-enabling and Investigational New Drug Application (IND)-enabling development work. The initiation of the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study in Beagle dogs, which represents a key component of the CTA-enabling and
IND-enabling
work, was delayed by several months, however, the study has been completed without incident. The acquisition of chemical reagents, biological reagents and laboratory supplies which are essential for the conduct of basic laboratory research, the conduct of nonclinical studies and the
15
Table of Contents
completion of GMP manufacturing of
BB-301,
has also become challenging due to the disruption of global supply chains inherent to the production of these materials. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the
COVID-19
pandemic on our business and we expect to reevaluate the timing of our anticipated preclinical and clinical milestones as we learn more and the impact of
COVID-19
on our industry becomes clearer.
We have also implemented a halt of
non-essential
business travel and a rotation system whereby staff work from home and attend the laboratory on designated days which may result in a reduction of laboratory work. As we transition our employees back to our premises, there is a risk that
COVID-19
infections occur at our offices or laboratory facilities and significantly affect our operations. Additionally, if any of our critical vendors are impacted, our business could be affected if we become unable to procure essential equipment in a timely manner or obtain supplies or services in adequate quantities and at acceptable prices.
Public Equity Offering
On September 15, 2022, we closed an underwritten public offering in which we issued and sold (i) 17,637,843 shares of the Company’s common stock, (ii) 12,171,628
pre-funded
warrants, with each
pre-funded
warrant immediately exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share until exercised in full and (iii) 29,809,471 common warrants, with each common warrant accompanying each issued share of common stock and/or
pre-funded
warrant and exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.66 per share (the “September 2022 Capital Raise”). The common warrants sold in the offering became exercisable on December 9, 2022, the date by which the Company (a) received approval from its stockholders to increase the number of shares of common stock it is authorized to issue and (b) effected such stockholder approval by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and will expire on the fifth anniversary of such initial exercise date. The combined purchase price for each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant was $0.60, which was allocated as $0.59 per share of common stock and $0.01 per common warrant.
The net proceeds to the Company from the public offering were approximately $16 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and public offering expenses payable by the Company, and excluding any proceeds the Company may receive upon exercise of the
pre-funded
warrants or the common warrants. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds for the clinical development of
BB-301,
including the natural history
lead-in
study and the Phase 1b/2a
BB-301
treatment study, for the continued advancement of development activities for other existing and new product candidates, for general corporate purposes and for strategic growth opportunities. The Company will have broad discretion in determining how the proceeds of the public offering will be used, and its discretion is not limited by the aforementioned possible uses.
Nasdaq Listing
On September 6, 2022, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that the minimum bid price per share for our common stock fell below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that therefore we did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
The letter also states that we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until March 6, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In accordance with Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we can regain compliance if at any time during the
180-day
period the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If by March 6, 2023, we cannot demonstrate compliance with the Rule 5550(a)(2), we may be eligible for additional time. To qualify for additional time, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and we will need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If we are not eligible for the second compliance period, then the Nasdaq Staff will provide notice that our securities will be subject to delisting. At such time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.
We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. These options include completing a reverse stock split of our common stock for the purpose of meeting the closing bid price requirement. We received stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on December 7, 2022 but currently have no plans to proceed. Such approval allows our board of directors, in its discretion, to elect to implement such reverse stock split at any time prior to December 7, 2023. Completing a reverse stock split will not, in of itself, cause us to remain in compliance with Nasdaq’s listing standards.
Development Programs
Our Pipeline
The following table sets forth the current product candidate and the development status:
Table 1. Pipeline: Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy
BB-301
We are developing
BB-301
for the treatment of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD).
BB-301
is the lead investigational agent under development by Benitec, and the key attributes of OPMD and
BB-301
are outlined in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Overview of the
BB-301
Program
BB-301
is a
first-in-class
genetic medicine employing the “silence and replace” approach for the treatment of OPMD. OPMD is an insidious, autosomal- dominant, late-onset, degenerative muscle disorder that typically presents in patients at
40-to-50
years of age. The disease is characterized by progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis). OPMD is caused by a specific mutation in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1).
16
Table of Contents
OPMD is a rare disease, however, patients have been diagnosed with OPMD in at least 33 countries. Patient populations suffering from OPMD are well- identified, and significant geographical clustering has been noted for patients with this disorder. Each of these attributes could facilitate efficient clinical development and global commercialization of
BB-301.
PABPN1 is a ubiquitous factor that promotes the interaction between the poly(A) polymerase and CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and, thus, controls the length of mRNA poly(A) tails, mRNA export from the nucleus, and alternative poly(A) site usage. The characteristic genetic mutation underlying OPMD results in trinucleotide repeat expansion(s) within exon 1 of PABPN1 and results in an expanded poly-alanine tract at the
N-terminal
end of PABPN1. The mutation generates a protein with an
N-terminal
expanded poly-alanine tract of up to 18 contiguous alanine residues, and the mutant protein is prone to the formation of intranuclear aggregates designated as intranuclear inclusions (INIs). The INIs that sequester wildtype PABPN1 may contribute to the “loss of function” phenotype associated with OPMD.
No therapeutic agents are approved for the treatment of OPMD. Additionally, there are no surgical interventions available to OPMD patients that modify the natural history of the disease, which is principally comprised of chronic deterioration of swallowing function.
BB-301
has received Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and the European Union and, upon achievement of regulatory approval for
BB-301
in these respective jurisdictions, the Orphan Drug Designations would provide commercial exclusivity independent of intellectual property protection. While OPMD is a rare medical disorder, we believe the commercial opportunity for a safe and efficacious therapeutic agent in this clinical indication exceeds $1 billion over the course of the commercial life of the product.
Benitec has previously outlined the core
CTA-enabling
and
IND-enabling
studies required by global regulatory agencies to support the initiation of
BB-301
clinical trials in OPMD patients, and these studies include a
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study (the “Pilot Dosing Study”) in large animals and a classical
12-week
GLP Toxicology and Biodistribution Study for
BB-301.
In these large animal studies,
BB-301
is directly injected into the pharyngeal muscles known to underlie the morbidity and mortality which characterizes the natural history of OPMD in human subjects.
As referenced above, the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study in large animals was the first of two
CTA-enabling
and
IND-enabling
studies conducted by Benitec. This study was carried out under the guidance of the scientific team at Benitec, with key elements of the design and execution of the study conducted in close collaboration with a team of experts in both medicine and surgery that have been deeply engaged in the treatment of OPMD patients for decades. The
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study and the GLP Toxicology and Biodistribution Study for
BB-301
were conducted in canine subjects in order to:
•
Support the validation and optimization of the newly designed route and method of
BB-301
administration,
•
Confirm the efficiency of vector transduction and transgene expression in the key tissue compartments underlying the morbidity and mortality that comprises the natural history of OPMD,
•
Confirm the optimal
BB-301
doses in advance of initiation of human clinical studies,
•
Facilitate the observation of key toxicological data-points.
The
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study was designed as an
8-week
study in Beagle dogs to confirm the transduction efficiency of
BB-301
upon administration via direct intramuscular injection into specific anatomical regions of the pharynx through the use of an open surgical procedure. This new method and route of
BB-301
administration was developed in collaboration with key surgical experts in the field of Otolaryngology, and this novel method of
BB-301
dosing will significantly enhance the ability of treating physicians to accurately administer the AAV-based investigational agent to the muscles that underlie the characteristic deficits associated with disease progression in OPMD. It is important to note that prior
BB-301
non-clinical
studies have reproducibly validated the robust biological activity achieved following direct intramuscular injection of the AAV-based agent. As an example, direct injection of
BB-301
into the tibialis anterior muscles of A17 mice facilitated robust transduction of the targeted skeletal muscle cells and supported complete remission of the OPMD disease phenotype in this animal model.
Benitec conducted the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study in Beagle dog subjects to demonstrate that direct intramuscular injection of BB-301 via the use of a proprietary dosing device in an open surgical procedure could safely achieve the following goals:
•
Biologically significant and dose-dependent levels of
BB-301
tissue transduction (i.e., delivery of the multi-functional
BB-301
genetic construct into the target pharyngeal muscle cells),
•
Broad-based and dose-dependent expression of the three distinct genes comprising the
BB-301
gene construct within the pharyngeal muscle cells, and
•
Biologically significant levels of target gene knock-down (i.e., inhibition of the expression of the gene of interest) within the pharyngeal muscle cells.
The Pilot Dosing Study evaluated the safety and biological activity of two concentrations of
BB-301
(1.0+E13 vg/mL and 3.0+E13 vg/mL) across three distinct doses (1.0+E13 vg/mL and 3.0+E13 vg/mL with a low injection volume, and 3.0+E13
17
Table of Contents
vg/mL with a high injection volume) following direct intramuscular injection into the Hypopharyngeus (HP) muscles and the Thyropharyngeus (TP) muscles of Beagle dogs via the use of a proprietary delivery device employed in an open surgical procedure. The HP muscle in Beagle dogs corresponds to the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor muscle in human subjects, and the TP muscle in Beagle dogs corresponds to the Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor muscle in human subjects.
BB-301
was injected only on Day 1 of the Pilot Dosing Study, and the corresponding canine pharyngeal muscles were harvested for molecular analyses after 8 weeks of observation post-injection.
BB-301
dosing was carried out independently by a veterinary surgeon and an Otolaryngologist with extensive experience regarding the provision of palliative surgical care for OPMD patients.
Molecular analyses have been completed for the canine subjects treated in the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study. Key interim data-sets derived from the analyses of pharyngeal muscle tissues isolated from 16 Beagle dog subjects (of the
24-subject
Beagle dog study population) are highlighted below. The final
data-set
derived from the completed molecular analyses of the pharyngeal muscle tissues of the canine subjects treated on the Pilot Dosing Study will be presented in a peer-reviewed format.
The key interim data-sets are summarized below:
Figure 4. Pharyngeal Muscle Tissue Transduction Levels Achieved by
BB-301
Regarding Gene Expression Levels Observed for
BB-301
Within the Pharyngeal Muscle Tissues (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7):
•
BB-301
encodes two distinct siRNA species (i.e., siRNA13 and siRNA17) which are each, independently, capable of inhibiting (i.e., “silencing”) the expression of the mutant form of the PABPN1 protein and the wild type (i.e., endogenous) form of the PABPN1 protein (importantly, the mutant form of the PABPN1 protein underlies the development, and progression, of OPMD).
•
BB-301
also codes for a wild type version of the PABPN1 protein whose intracellular expression is unaffected by the inhibitory activities of siRNA13 and siRNA17; this “codon optimized” transcript drives the expression of a PABPN1 protein (i.e., coPABPN1) which serves to replenish the endogenous form of the PABPN1 protein and to replace the mutant form of PABPN1 that underlies the development and progression of OPMD in diseased tissues.
•
For comparative purposes, it should be noted that the average range of expression for wild type PABPN1 within the pharyngeal muscle cells of Beagle dogs is 4.5 copies per
cell-to-7.8
copies per cell.

within Pharyngeal Muscle Tissues
Regarding Wild Type PABPN1 Silencing (i.e., target “knock-down”) Observed for
BB-301
Within the Pharyngeal Muscle Tissues (Figure 8):
•
As noted above,
BB-301
encodes two distinct siRNA species (i.e., siRNA13 and siRNA17) which are each, independently, capable of inhibiting (i.e., “silencing”) the expression of all forms of the PABPN1 protein (siRNA13 and siRNA17 silence the expression of both wild type PABPN1 [wtPABPN1] and mutant PABPN1).
•
While the Beagle dog subjects treated in the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study do not express mutant PABPN1, the level of
BB-301-driven
gene silencing for the PABPN1 target can be indirectly assessed in these study subjects due to the equivalent inhibitory effects of siRNA13 and siRNA17 on both wtPABPN1 and mutant PABPN1.
•
Thus, the wtPABPN1 silencing activity observed in the
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study serves as a surrogate for the silencing activity that would be anticipated in the presence of mutant PABPN1.
•
BB-301
has been evaluated in prior
non-clinical
studies in animals that express mutant PABPN1 and, as a result, manifest the symptomatic phenotype of OPMD; in the symptomatic animal model of OPMD (i.e. the A17 mouse model), the achievement of PABPN1 silencing levels of 31% inhibition (or higher) following
BB-301
administration led to resolution of OPMD disease symptoms and the elimination of the histopathological hallmarks of OPMD.

Pilot Dosing Study conducted by Benitec as compared to the prior
BB-301
Beagle dog dosing study carried out independently by the previous
BB-301
licensee. The
BB-301
dosing study conducted by the prior
BB-301
licensee employed
non-ideal
routes and methods of
BB-301
administration to the target pharyngeal muscle tissues and employed similarly limited analytical methods at the completion of the dosing phase of the study. Subsequently, the Benitec team worked to optimize the route and method of administration of
BB-301
and to refine the core analytical methods employed following the completion of dosing of the large animal subjects.
The current proprietary method of
BB-301
delivery to the key pharyngeal muscles of study subjects, and the proprietary molecular analytical methods employed to assay the pharyngeal muscle tissues of study subjects, with both methods having been developed by the Benitec team, led to the observation of broad-based transduction of the targeted pharyngeal muscle tissues (Figure 9, represents individual sections of the TP muscle following
BB-301
dosing). Critically, the Benitec-developed methods also facilitated the achievement of a
228-fold
improvement (+22,647%) in
BB-301
transduction of the HP muscle and a
113-fold
improvement (+11,163%) in
BB-301
transduction of the TP muscle relative to the levels of
BB-301
transduction observed by the previous
BB-301
licensee at identical
BB-301
doses in identical canine study populations (Figure 10).

Following the disclosure of the positive interim
BB-301
Pilot Dosing Study results, Benitec completed
pre-CTA
and
pre-IND
meetings with regulatory agencies in France, Canada, and the United States.
Summary of Regulatory Interactions:
•
Benitec successfully completed the regulatory interactions required to support initiation of the OPMD clinical development program in 2022
•
Successful regulatory engagement comprised the completion of the following meetings:
•
Preclinical Trial Application
(Pre-CTA)
Consultation Meeting with Health Canada
•
Scientific Advice Meeting with The National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products in France (L’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé or “ANSM”)
•
Type C Meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
In December 2022 Benitec began screening OPMD subjects at the first clinical trial site in the United States in support of the OPMD clinical development program.
Summary of the
BB-301
Clinical Development Program:
•
The
BB-301
clinical development program began in 2022, and the conduct of the development program will comprise approximately
76-weeks
of
follow-up
for each OPMD study participant, inclusive of:
•
6-month
pre-treatment
observation periods employing quantitative radiographic imaging techniques for evaluation of the baseline disposition and natural history of OPMD-derived dysphagia in each study participant
•
1 day of
BB-301
dosing to initiate participation in the Phase 1b/2a
single-arm,
open-label, sequential, dose escalation cohort study
•
52-weeks
of post-dosing
follow-up
for conclusive evaluation of the primary and secondary endpoints of the Phase 1b/2a
BB-301
treatment study
•
The screening of OPMD subjects for enrollment into the OPMD Natural History Study began in 2022, and this observational study will facilitate the characterization of OPMD patient disposition at baseline and assess subsequent rates of progression of dysphagia (swallowing impairment) in subjects with OPMD via the use of quantitative radiographic measures of global swallowing function and pharyngeal constrictor muscle function along with clinical assessments and patient-reported self-assessments of swallowing function
•
Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Studies (VFSS) will be conducted to complete the following methodological assessments:
•
Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity Scale (DIGEST)
•
Pharyngeal Area at Maximum Constriction (PhAMPC)
•
Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio (PCR)
•
Clinical measures of global swallowing capacity and oropharyngeal dysphagia
•
Patient-reported measures of oropharyngeal dysphagia
•
The natural history of dysphagia observed for each OPMD study participant, as characterized by the quantitative radiographic measures and the clinical and patient self-reported assessments outlined above, will serve as the baseline for comparative assessments of safety and efficacy of
BB-301
upon rollover of OPMD study subjects from the Natural History Study onto the Phase 1b/2a
BB-301
treatment study
22
Table of Contents
•
Upon the achievement of
6-months
of
follow-up
in the Natural History Study, OPMD Natural History Study participants can become eligible for enrollment onto the Phase 1b/2a treatment study with the investigational genetic medicine,
BB-301,
which uses an
AAV9-based
gene therapy approach for the treatment of OPMD-derived dysphagia
•
This
first-in-human
(FIH) clinical trial will be a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of intramuscular doses of
BB-301
administered to the pharyngeal muscles of subjects with OPMD
•
Upon rollover from the Natural History Study onto the Phase 1b/2a
BB-301
treatment study, the
follow-up
of OPMD study participants will continue for
52-weeks,
and the primary endpoints (safety) and secondary endpoints (comprising the quantitative radiographic measures of global swallowing function and pharyngeal constrictor muscle function, and the clinical and
patient-reported
assessments noted above) will be evaluated during each
90-day
period following Day 1 (Day 1 represents the day of
BB-301
intramuscular injection).
Royalties, milestone payments and other license fees
We are required to pay royalties, milestone payments and other license fees in connection with our licensing of intellectual property from third parties, including as discussed below.
We have collaborated with Biomics Biotechnologies Co., Ltd., or Biomics, pursuant to several collaboration agreements in relation to single-stranded RNA and shRNA sequences for treatment of hepatitis B. In July 2015, we entered into an
earn-out
agreement with Biomics which confirmed Benitec’s ownership of certain patents resulting from the collaboration in exchange for an upfront payment and equity issuance to Biomics and a share of certain future licensing revenue received by Benitec.
October 2020 Capital Raise
On October 6, 2020, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of common stock and common stock equivalents. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $11.5 million and net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million from the offering.
April 2021 Capital Raise
On April 30, 2021, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of common stock and common stock equivalents. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $14.3 million and net proceeds of approximately $12.7 million from the offering.
September 2022 Capital Raise
On September 15, 2022, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of common stock and common stock equivalents. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $17.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $16.0 million from the offering.
Results of Operations
Revenues
The Company has not generated any revenues from the sales of products. Revenues from licensing fees are included in the revenue from customers line item on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our licensing fees have been generated through the licensing of our ddRNAi technology to biopharmaceutical companies. The Company recognized licensing fee revenues totaling $14 thousand and $25 thousand during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Table of Contents
Royalties and License Fees
Royalties and license fees consist primarily of payments we are required to remit for royalties and other payments related to
in-licensed
intellectual property. Under our
in-license
agreements, we may pay
up-front
fees and milestone payments and be subject to future royalties. We cannot precisely predict the amount, if any, of royalties we will owe in the future, and if our calculations of royalty payments are incorrect, we may owe additional royalties, which could negatively affect our results of operations. As our product sales increase, we may, from time to time, disagree with our third-party collaborators as to the appropriate royalties owed, and the resolution of such disputes may be costly, may consume management’s time, and may damage our relationship with our collaborators. Furthermore, we may enter into additional license agreements in the future, which may also include royalty, milestone and other payments.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses relate primarily to the cost of conducting clinical and preclinical trials. Preclinical and clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. The Company records accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and contract manufacturing activities. The Company records the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and includes these costs in trade and other payables on the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance at the end of each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. The Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits, travel, and equity-based compensation expense. General and administrative expenses also include facility expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and audit services and other related costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase as the Company focuses on the continued development of the preclinical OPMD program. The Company also anticipates an increase in expenses relating to accounting, legal and regulatory-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and other similar costs.

During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, we incurred $3.8 million and $6.4 million in research and development expenses, respectively, as compared to $3.1 million and $5.9 million for the comparable periods ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses relate primarily to the OPMD project. The year-over-year increases for the six-month period reflect conclusion of the BB-301 Regulatory Toxicology Study and the Parallel Assay Method Development, Qualification, and Validation project, and the continuation of the GMP manufacturing project and Natural History Study.
General and administrative expense totaled $1.9 million and $3.8 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.7 million and $3.8 million for the comparable periods ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase for the three-month periods ended December 31 relate to higher bonuses and legal fees, partially offset by lower listing and filing fees and stock-based compensation. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Other income (loss), net during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, which consists of foreign currency transaction gain (loss), interest expense, other income, and unrealized loss on investment, totaled $199 thousand and $(314) thousand, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, other income (loss) totaled $14 thousand and $(210) thousand. The increase in foreign currency transaction gains during the three-month periods ended December 31 and in foreign currency transaction losses during the six-month periods ended December 31 reflect changes in foreign exchange rates. Other income relates to recognition of a tax penalty refund receivable. Unrealized loss on investment decreased for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same prior year periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has incurred cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since our predecessor’s inception in 1995. The Company had accumulated losses of $159 million as of December 31, 2022. We expect that our research and development expenses may increase due to the continued development of the OPMD program. It is also likely that there will be an increase in the general and administrative expenses due to the obligations of being a domestic public company in the United States.
We had no borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and do not currently have a credit facility.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10.5 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Currently, our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank accounts.

Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $9.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of our net loss, partially offset by
non-cash
expenses, and changes in working capital, including an increase in payables.
26
Table of Contents
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.0 million and $0 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash from financing activities in 2022 was related to the issuance of common stock,
pre-funded
warrants, and Series 2 warrants, including $17.9 million in gross proceeds from the September 2022 Capital Raise, partially offset by $1.9 million in share issuance costs.
The future of the Company as an operating business will depend on its ability to manage operating costs and budgeted amounts and obtain adequate financing. While we continue to progress discussions and advance opportunities to engage with pharmaceutical companies and continue to seek licensing partners for ddRNAi in disease areas that are not our focus, there can be no assurance as to whether we will enter into such arrangements or what the terms of any such arrangement could be.
While we have established some licensing arrangements, we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates.
Unless and until we establish significant revenues from licensing programs, strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, or from product sales, we anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of product candidates and begin to prepare to commercialize any product that receives regulatory approval. We are subject to the risks inherent in the development of new gene therapy products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The Company has performed a review of its cash flow forecasts and has concluded that substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company does not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months without raising additional funds and the success of raising such additional capital is not solely within the Company’s control.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials for our ddRNAi and silence and replace product candidates;
•
the timing and costs of our planned preclinical studies for our ddRNAi and silence and replace product candidates;
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;
•
the outcome, timing, and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;
•
revenue received from commercial sales of any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval;
•
the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing, consulting, or other arrangements that we may establish;
•
the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and
•
the extent to which we need to
in-license
or acquire other products and technologies.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
On October 1, 2016, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space in Hayward, California that originally expired in April 2018. The Company has entered into lease amendments that extended the lease through June 2025. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract research organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations and other service providers and vendors. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and, therefore, are cancellable contracts and not considered contractual obligations and commitments.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q
describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
27
Table of Contents
A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) the Company is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates the Company could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled “Risk Factors.” Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that the Company’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and provide a meaningful presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies:
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses relate primarily to the cost of conducting clinical and preclinical trials. Preclinical and clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. The Company records accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and contract manufacturing activities. The Company records the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and includes these costs in trade and other payables on the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance at the end of each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. The Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred.
Share-based Compensation Expense
The Company records share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all share-based employee compensation awarded to employees and
non-employees
to be recorded as an expense over the shorter of the service period or the vesting period. The Company determines employee and
non-employee
share-based compensation based on grant-date fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.

ASU
2016-13-In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-13:
“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)”. This ASU represents a significant change in the accounting for credit losses model by requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (CECL). Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The Company has determined that it has met the criteria of a smaller reporting company (“SRC”) as of November 15, 2019. As such, ASU
2019-10:
“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Derivatives and Hedging, and Leases: Effective Dates” amended the effective date for the Company to be for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will adopt this ASU effective July 1, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information pursuant to this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e)
and
15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As of the end of the period covered by this Report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule
13a-15
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 other than as set forth below.
We may fail to continue to meet the listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market and our failure to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange could adversely affect the liquidity off our common stock.
Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including maintaining a minimum share price. For example, the current continued listing requirements of Nasdaq provide, among other things, that a company may be delisted if the bid price of its stock drops below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days.
On September 6, 2022, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that the minimum bid price per share for our common stock fell below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that therefore we did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The letter also states that we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until March 6, 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In accordance with Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we can regain compliance if at any time during the 180-day period the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If by March 6, 2023, we cannot demonstrate compliance with the Rule 5550(a)(2), we may be eligible for additional time. To qualify for additional time, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and we will need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If we are not eligible for the second compliance period, then the Nasdaq Staff will provide notice that our securities will be subject to delisting. At such time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.
If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the minimum share price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum share price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.
We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. These options include completing a reverse stock split of our common stock for the purpose of meeting the closing bid price requirement. Our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at our stockholder meeting on December 7, 2022.
If our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock could begin to trade on one of the markets operated by OTC Markets Group, including OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC Pink (formerly known as the “pink sheets”), as the case may be. In such event, our common stock could be subject to the “penny stock” rules which, among other things, require brokers or dealers to approve investors’ accounts, receive written agreements and determine investor suitability for transactions and disclose risks relating to investing in the penny stock market. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets. In addition, there can be no assurance that our common stock would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or markets.

We will need to continue our efforts to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may negatively impact our ability to continue as a going concern.
Developing ddRNAi products is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our product candidates in preclinical studies and in future clinical trials and as we undertake preclinical studies of new product candidates. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were $10.5 million. We estimate that without additional financing, our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months and the success of raising such additional capital is not solely within the Company’s control. Our operating plan may require changes and delays as a result of such liquidity issues. We may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government grants or other third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In addition, because the length of time and activities associated with successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and to commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval.
Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may compromise our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our shareholders, and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If we incur indebtedness we may be required to agree to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could compromise our ability to conduct our business. We could also seek financing through arrangements with collaborative partners at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some or all of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.
If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any approved product candidates.
