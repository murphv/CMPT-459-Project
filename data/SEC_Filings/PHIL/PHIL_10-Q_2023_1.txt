NATURE OF BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION
PHI
Group, Inc. (n/k/a Philux Global Group Inc) (the “Company” or “PHI”) ( www.philuxglobal.com ) is primarily
engaged in mergers and acquisitions, advancing PHILUX Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a “Reserved Alternative Investment Fund”
(“RAIF”) under the laws of Luxembourg, and establishing the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam. Besides, the Company provides
corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through our wholly
owned subsidiary PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.) (www.philuxcapital.com )
and invests in selective
industries and special situations aiming to potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. PHILUX Global Funds
intends to include a number of sub-funds for investment in select growth opportunities in the areas of agriculture, renewable energy,
real estate, infrastructure, and the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam.
BACKGROUND
Originally
incorporated on June 8, 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., a Nevada corporation, the Company applied for a Certificate of Domestication and
filed Articles of Domestication to become a Wyoming corporation on September 20, 2017. In the beginning, the Company was foremost engaged
in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New
York and one in California. In January 2000, the Company changed its name to Providential Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation, following
a business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company. In February 2000, the Company
then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership
and ceased its financial services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October
2000 to October 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in various transactions in connection with mergers and acquisitions
advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare,
private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand
Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and
Philand Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation
(a Nevada corporation), and mainly focused on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural resource businesses.
The
Company is currently focused on PHILUX Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF by launching Philux Global Select Growth Fund and potentially other
sub-funds for investment in real estate, renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare and the Asia Diamond Exchange in
Vietnam. In addition, PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly Capital Holdings, Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, continues
to provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory and consulting services for U.S.
and international companies. The Company has signed agreements to acquire majority equity interests in Kota Construction LLC and Kota
Energy Group LLC which are engaged in solar energy business ( https://www.kotasolar.com ), Tin Thanh Group, a Vietnamese joint stock
company ( www.tinthanhgroup.vn ) and Van Phat Dat Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese joint stock company. In addition, the Company
is in the process of amending the Purchase and Sale Agreement that was originally signed on January 18, 2022 with Five-Grain Treasure
Spirits Co., Ltd., a Chinese baiju distiller, to collaborate in launching American-made baiju products through Empire Spirits, Inc.,
a subsidiary of the Company. The Company will relocate CO2-1-0 (CARBON) Corp., a subsidiary of the Company engaged in carbon emission
mitigation using blockchain and crypto technologies, to the United Arab Emirates. These activities are disclosed in greater detail elsewhere
in this report. No assurances can be made that the Company will be successful in achieving its plans.
BUSINESS
STRATEGY
PHI’s
strategy is to:
1.
Identify, build, acquire, commit and deploy valuable resources with distinctive competitive advantages;
2.
Identify, evaluate, acquire, participate and compete in attractive businesses that have large, growing market potential;
3.
Build an attractive investment that includes points of exit for investors through capital appreciation or spin-offs of business units.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PHI Group, Inc. (a/k/a Philux Global Group, Inc.) and its active wholly owned
subsidiaries: (1) PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc., a Wyoming corporation ( 100 % ), (2) PHI Luxembourg Development S.A., a Luxembourg corporation
( 100 % ), (3) PHILUX Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Luxembourg Reserved Alternative Investment Fund ( 100 % ), (4) PHILUX Global General
Partners SA, a Luxembourg corporation ( 100 % ), (5) PHI Luxembourg Holding SA, a Luxembourg corporation ( 100 % ), (6) Asia Diamond Exchange,
Inc., a Wyoming corporation ( 100 % ), and (7) CO2-1-0 (Carbon) Corp. ( 100 % ), collectively referred to as the “Company.” All
significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
INTERIM
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for complete financial statements. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements for the year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal reoccurring accruals
have been made to the financial statements. The results of operation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
USE
OF ESTIMATES
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents.
MARKETABLE
SECURITIES
The
Company’s securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified as available-for-sale
may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes.
Typically,
each investment in marketable securities represents less than twenty percent ( 20 % ) of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents
of the investee, and each security is quoted on either the OTC Markets or other public exchanges. As such, each investment is accounted
for in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115.
Unrealized
holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholder’s
equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings based upon the adjusted cost
of the specific security sold. On December 31, 2022, the marketable securities were recorded at $ 290
based upon the fair value of the
marketable securities at that time.
F- 6
FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair
Value - Definition and Hierarchy
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the
inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
A
fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available.
Valuation
techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is categorized
into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
Level
1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability
to access.
Level
2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level
3
- Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
Fair
value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that
are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily
available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are
affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace,
the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
To
the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of
fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher
or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment
exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used
to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy
in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement.
Fair
Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs
The
Company holds and may invest public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real estate,
convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques for their respective
valuations.
Equity
Securities in Public Companies
Unrestricted
The
Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported sales
price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Securities
traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.
F- 7
Restricted
Securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods and
underwriter’s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts. The
Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company believes there
are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts, factors that
will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities’ trading characteristics, volume, length and overall
impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately until the securities
may be freely traded.
If
it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect to
treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method.
Investments
in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that significant
inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies may be categorized
in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The
Company’s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-term
notes payable, convertible notes, derivative liability and accounts payable.
As
of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments.
Effective
July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157),
Fair Value Measurements
and adopted this Statement for the assets
and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value,
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value
measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. On September 30, 202â, the
Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires
that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized as one of the types of investments based upon the
methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining fair value.
Assets
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company also has convertible notes and derivative liabilities as
disclosed in this report that are measured at fair value on a regular basis until paid off or exercised.
Available-for-sale
securities
The
Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation hierarchy
for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
and liabilities.
The
company’s policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility
of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can be measured
using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the type of
inputs.
ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE
Management
reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have
any accounts receivable.
F- 8
PROPERTIES
AND EQUIPMENT
Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the assets from
three
to
five
years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
REVENUE
RECOGNITION STANDARDS
ASC
606-10 provides the following overview of how revenue is recognized from an entity’s contracts with customers: An entity recognizes
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step
3: Determine the transaction price – The transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which an entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract – Any entity typically allocates the transaction
price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of each distinct good or service promised
in the contract.
Step
5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation – An entity recognizes revenue when (or as) it
satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control
of that good or service).
The
amount of revenue recognized is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. A performance obligation may be satisfied
at a point in time (typically for promises to transfer goods to a customer) or over time (typically for promises to transfer service
to a customer). For performance obligations satisfied over time, an entity recognizes revenue over time by selecting an appropriate method
for measuring the entity’s progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. (Paragraphs 606-10 25-23 through
25-30).
In
addition, ASC 606-10 contains guidance on the disclosures related to revenue, and notes the following:
It
also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that would result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive
information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with
customers. Specifically, Section 606-10-50 requires an entity to provide information about:
-
Revenue recognized from contracts with customers, including disaggregation of revenue into appropriate categories.
-
Contract balances, including the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities.
-
Performance obligations, including when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations and the transaction prices is that
is allocated to the remaining performance obligations in a contract.
-
Significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts.
Additionally,
Section 340-40-50 requires an entity to provide quantitative and/or qualitative information about assets recognized from the costs to
obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.
The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 606-10. The Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues
in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines and expenses are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred.
F- 9
STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION
Effective
July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application
method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective
date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for which the requisite
service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining requisite services are
rendered.
RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES
In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and receives
marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers can be affected
by economic fluctuations and each customer’s business growth. The actual realized value of these securities could be significantly
different than recorded value.
RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06-Debt-Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting
For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments
by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as
a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions
that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify
for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2020. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2020-06 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2023.
Update
No. 2018-13 – August 2018
Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
Modifications:
The following disclosure requirements were modified in Topic 820:
1.
In lieu of a roll-forward for Level 3 fair value measurements, a non-public entity is required to disclose transfers into and out of
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities.
2.
For investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an
investee’s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to
the entity or announced the timing publicly.
3.
The amendments clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement
as of the reporting date.
Additions:
The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820; however, the disclosures are not required for non-public entities:
1.
The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements
held at the end of the reporting period.
2.
The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable
inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average
if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution
of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.
The
amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2019.
F- 10
Update
No. 2018-07 – June 2018
Compensation
– Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
Main
Provisions: The amendments in this Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance
on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest
and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions
in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment
awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to
the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that fiscal year.

The
transition provisions in ASC Topic 606 require that a public business entity and certain other specified entities adopt ASC Topic 606
for annual reporting 3 periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. FN2
All other entities are required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019.

core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:
1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
3.
Determine the transaction price.
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The
amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining
the related principles for those areas.
The
Company has either evaluated or is currently evaluating the implications, if any, of each of these pronouncements and the possible impact
they may have on the Company’s financial statements. In most cases, management has determined that the implementation of these
pronouncements would not have a material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
Company’s financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations
of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also
affect supplemental information contained in the external disclosures of the Company including information regarding contingencies, risk
and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and
conservatively applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed by us for reasonableness and conservatism on a consistent basis throughout
the Company. Primary areas where financial information of the Company is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application
of judgment include acquisitions, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, recoverability of deferred tax and the valuation of
shares issued for services. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Valuation
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
The
recoverability of long-lived assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. As it relates to definite life intangible assets, we apply the impairment rules
as required by SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets to Be Disposed Of” as amended
by SFAS No. 144, which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the
intangible asset. The impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and, thus,
the recoverability of the asset.
Income
Taxes
We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases
of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon
historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As of
December 31, 2022, we estimated the allowance on net deferred tax assets to be one hundred percent of the net deferred tax assets.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The
following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, our financial condition on December 31, 2022 and factors that we believe could affect our future financial condition and results
of operations. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance.
This
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States (“GAAP”). All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars.

in the amount of $1,148,849 for the same period ended December 31, 2021. The primary underlying reason for the decrease of $362,050 in

cash requirements for the next 12 months are expected to be generated from operations, sale of marketable securities and additional financing.
The Company plans to generate revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and acquisitions of target
companies with cash flows.
AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: The Company may use various sources of funds, including short-term loans, long-term debt, equity capital,
and project financing as may be necessary. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required capital to implement its business
plan.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc.’s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk
Some
of our operations are conducted in other countries whose official currencies are not U.S. dollars. However, the effect of the fluctuations
of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations.
Interest
Rate Risk
We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals, with fixed
interest rates.
Valuation
of Securities Risk
Since
a part of our assets is in the form of marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending on the market
value of the securities we hold.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried
out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls
and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation,
our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
December 31, 2022, based on the material weaknesses defined below.
Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
Management’s
Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
-
pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets,
-
provide
reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
and
-
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company’s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022 based on the framework set forth in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:
(i)
inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;
(ii)
ineffective
controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting processes.
If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.
Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December
31, 2022.
11
Management’s
Remediation Plan
We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes in the future:
(i)
appoint
additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and
(ii)
adopt
sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.
The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly report ended December
31, 2022 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.
Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm
This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management’s
report in this Quarterly Report.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No
changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting have come to management’s attention during the fiscal
quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

1A. RISK FACTORS
Investment
in our securities is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets forth factors
related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment
in our securities to decline and result in a loss.
General
Risks Related to Our Business
Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.
Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and certain external experts. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key personnel and/or outside experts could impede implementation and execution of our business
strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees.
Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse
areas required for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able
to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future.
Risks
Related to Mergers and Acquisitions
Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even when an
acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive as management
may have projected.
The
Company continues evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management’s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may be achieved by
acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company’s ability to successfully integrate
any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate
acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.
Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including:
●
failure
of the acquired business to achieve expected results;
●
diversion
of management’s attention;
●
failure
to retain key personnel of the acquired business;
●
additional
financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;
●
the
potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and
●
the
high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.
These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of the securities
received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved in acquisition.
In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working
capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
13
Risks
associated with private equity (PE) funds
There
are, broadly, five key risks to private equity investing:
1.
Operational risk:
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate processes and systems supporting the organization. It is a
key consideration for investors regardless of the asset classes that funds invest into.
2.
Funding risk:
This is the risk that investors are not able to provide their capital commitments and is effectively the
‘investor default risk’. PE funds typically do not call upon all the committed investor capital and only draw capital once
they have identified investments. Funding risk is closely related to liquidity risk, as when investors are faced with a funding shortfall,
they may be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet their commitments.
3.
Liquidity risk:
This refers to an investor’s inability to redeem their investment at any given time. PE investors
are ‘locked-in’ for between five and ten years, or more, and are unable to redeem their committed capital on request during
that period. Additionally, given the lack of an active market for the underlying investments, it is difficult to estimate when the investment
can be realized and at what valuation.
4.
Market risk:
There are many forms of market risk affecting PE investments, such as broad equity market exposure, geographical/sector
exposure, foreign exchange, commodity prices, and interest rates. Unlike in public markets where prices fluctuate constantly and are
marked-to-market, PE investments are subject to infrequent valuations and are typically valued quarterly and with some element of subjectivity
inherent in the assessment. However, the market prices of publicly listed equities at the time of sale of a portfolio company will ultimately
impact realization value.
5.
Capital risk:
The capital at risk is equal to the net asset value of the unrealized portfolio plus the future undrawn commitments.
In theory, there is a risk that all portfolio companies could experience a decline in their current value, and in the worst-case drop
to a valuation of zero. Capital risk is closely related to market risk. Whilst market risk is the uncertainty associated with unrealized
gains or losses, capital risk is the possibility of having a realized loss of the original capital at the end of a fund’s life.
There
are two main ways that capital risk brings itself to bear - through the failure of underlying companies within the PE portfolio and suppressed
equity prices which make exits less attractive. The former is impacted by the quality of the fund manager, i.e. their ability to select
portfolio companies with good growth prospects and to create value, hence why fund manager selection is key for investors. The condition,
method, and timing of the exit are all factors that can affect how value can be created for investors.
Risks
Associated with Building and Operating a Diamond Exchange
Fundamentally,
the key requirements for a successful diamond exchange include the following:
1.
Supply : One of the most important things for a successful trading hub is the ability to secure ample, stable, and sustainable
supply of commodities. In the case of a diamond exchange, adequate supply of rough diamond must be secured to make it successful.
2.
Capital : Besides the infrastructure, facilities, systems, and amenities to operate the diamond exchange, the organizers
must be able to arrange very large amounts of capital to facilitate the trade and other business activities related to the exchange.
3.
Participants : The organizers must be able to attract a large number of international diamonteers to participate in the
exchange. There is no guarantee that people will come when the exchange is built.
4.
Venue:
The venue must be able to provide competitive advantages compared with existing diamond exchanges in the world in
terms of (a) modern facilities, latest technologies and state-of-the-art provisions, (b) tax relief, (c) financial facilitating network
from big investors, (d) retail banking, lending institutions and foreign exchange facilities, (e) licenses and registrations, (f) global
multi-commodities trading flatform, and (g) other amenities.
14
Risks
Associated with International Markets
As
some of our business activities are currently involved with international markets, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability .
Some
of our business activities are currently involved with non-US countries. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations, we
are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock market
fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks
Related to Our Securities
Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other stockholders
wanted such a change to occur.
Though
our executive officers and directors as of the date of this report, in the aggregate, only hold a small portion of our outstanding common
stock, we have the majority voting rights associated with the Company’s Class B Series I Preferred Stock, which decision may allow
the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even
if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.
The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price.
The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies
whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may be unable to sell
their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses.
Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the tradability
in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations.
Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below $5.00 per share,
our securities are within the definition of a “penny stock.” As a result, it is possible that our securities may be subject
to the “penny stock” rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required
to comply with the Commission’s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:
*Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;
*Receive
the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction; and
*Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser.
These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities.
Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us.
It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop
and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
publicly traded companies to obtain.
