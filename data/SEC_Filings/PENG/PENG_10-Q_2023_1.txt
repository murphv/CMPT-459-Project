Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include SGH and its consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial information. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, to fairly state the financial information set forth herein. These consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Fiscal Year :
Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the last Friday in August. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Financial information for our subsidiaries in Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag because their fiscal years end on July 31 of each year. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06 –
Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity: Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. This ASU requires an entity to use the if-converted method in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments. This ASU is effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 and permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition. We adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2023 under the modified retrospective method. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the previously separated equity component and associated issuance costs of our
2.25 % convertible senior notes due 2026 were reclassified from additional paid-in capital to long-term debt, thereby eliminating future amortization of the debt discount as interest expense.
The following table summarizes the effects of adopting ASU 2020-06: Ending Balance as of August 26, 2022 Adoption of ASU 2020-06 Beginning Balance as of August 27, 2022 Long-term debt $ 591,389   $ 32,183   $ 623,572   Additional paid-in capital 448,112   ( 50,822 ) 397,290   Retained earnings 251,344   18,639   269,983   In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 –
Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Asset and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , to require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers . We adopted ASU 2021-08 in the third quarter of 2022 for any acquisitions occurring after our adoption. 10 Business Acquisition Stratus Technologies On August 29, 2022 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed our previously announced acquisition of Storm Private Holdings I Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Stratus Holding Company” and together with its subsidiaries, “Stratus Technologies”), pursuant to the terms of that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 28, 2022, by and among SGH, Stratus Holding Company and Storm Private Investments LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Seller”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, among other matters, Seller sold to SGH, and SGH purchased from Seller, all of Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the outstanding equity securities of Stratus Holding Company (the “Share Purchase”). Stratus will operate as part of SGH’s Intelligent Platform Solutions (“IPS”) segment. Stratus Technologies is a global leader in simplified, protected, and autonomous computing platforms and services in the data center and at the Edge. For more than 40 years, Stratus Technologies has provided high-availability, fault-tolerant computing to Fortune 500 companies and small-to-medium sized businesses enabling them to securely and remotely run critical applications with minimal downtime. The acquisition of Stratus Technologies further enhances SGH’s growth and diversification strategy and complements and expands SGH’s IPS business in data center and edge environments. Purchase Price :
At the closing of the transaction, we paid the seller a cash purchase price of $ 225
million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the Seller has the right to receive, and we will be obligated to pay, contingent consideration (if any) of up to $ 50
million (the “Earnout”) based on the gross profit performance of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing. The Earnout, if any, will be payable in cash, ordinary shares of SGH or a mix of cash and SGH Shares, at our election. See “Equity – SGH Shareholders’ Equity – Stratus Technologies Earnout.” Cash paid was utilized, in part, to settle the outstanding debt of Stratus Technologies as of the closing of the transaction and was recognized as a component of consideration transferred. As a result, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed do not include an assumed liability for the outstanding debt of Stratus Technologies.
The provisional purchase price was as follows: Cash $ 225,000   Additional payment for net working capital adjustment
(1) 17,246   Fair value of Earnout 20,800   $ 263,046   (1) Includes $ 14.4
million paid at closing and an estimated $ 2.8
million payable subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2023 upon completion of the review of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Contingent Consideration :
The Earnout was accounted for as contingent consideration. As of the Acquisition Date, the fair value of the Earnout was estimated to be $ 20.8
million and was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis in a risk-neutral framework with assumptions for volatility, market price of risk adjustment, risk-free rate and cost of debt. The fair value measurement was based on significant inputs, not observable in the market, including forecasted gross profit, comparable company volatility, discount rate and cost of debt. The fair value of the Earnout was estimated based on the Company’s evaluation of the probability and amount of Earnout to be achieved based on the expected gross profit of Stratus Technologies. A Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the Earnout payment, which was discounted to its present value based on the expected payment date of the Earnout. The model used an estimated gross profit volatility of
33.4 % and a discount rate of
7.3 % as of the Acquisition Date. The Earnout is revalued each quarter and any change in valuation is reflected in our results of operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we adjusted the fair value of the Earnout to its current fair value with such change recognized in income from operations. The change in fair value reflected new information about the estimate of the gross profit of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing. As of November 25, 2022, the fair value of the Earnout was $ 24.5
million. Provisional Valuation :
We estimated the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of Stratus Technologies as of the Acquisition Date. Due to the timing of acquisition and the contractual provisions to review the net working capital of the acquired Stratus Technologies business, the estimated purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary valuation analyses. These preliminary values may change in future reporting
11 periods as additional information becomes available and upon finalization of the net working capital adjustment.
The provisional valuation of the Stratus Technologies assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents $ 29,174   Accounts receivable 26,685   Inventories 10,890   Other current assets 6,536   Property and equipment 7,292   Operating lease right-of-use assets 9,216   Intangible assets 123,700   Goodwill 125,929   Other noncurrent assets 11,661   Accounts payable and accrued expenses ( 32,656 ) Other current liabilities ( 36,723 ) Noncurrent operating lease liabilities ( 7,067 ) Other noncurrent liabilities ( 11,591 ) Total net assets acquired $ 263,046   The goodwill arising from the acquisition of Stratus Technologies was assigned to our IPS segment. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary estimated fair values and useful lives of identifiable intangible assets are as follows: Amount Estimated useful life (in years) Technology $ 82,000   5 Customer relationships 27,800   8 Trademarks/trade names 10,000   9 In-process research and development 3,900   N/A $ 123,700   • Technology intangible assets
were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method based on the discounted cash flow and technology obsolescence rate. Discounted cash flow requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, including projected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates calculated based on the cost of equity adjusted for various risks, including the size of the acquiree, industry risk and other risk factors. • Customer relationship intangible assets
were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing intangible assets after reduction by an estimated fair rate of return on contributory assets required to generate the customer relationship revenues. Key assumptions included discounted cash flow, estimated life cycle and customer attrition rates. • Trademark/trade name intangible assets
were valued using the relief from royalty method, which is the discounted cash flow savings accruing to the owner by virtue of the fact that the owner is not required to license the trademarks/trade names from a third party. Key assumptions included attributable revenue expected from the trademarks/trade names, royalty rates and assumed asset life. • In-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) relates to next generation fault tolerant architecture. IPR&D is indefinite-lived and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. Amortization will commence upon completion of research and development efforts. IPR&D was valued based on discounted cash flow, which requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, including projected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information : The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents SGH’s combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Stratus Technologies had occurred on August 27, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on various adjustments and assumptions and is not necessarily
12 indicative of what SGH’s results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition been completed as of August 27, 2021 or will be for any future periods. Furthermore, the pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue, synergies or dis-synergies, or cost savings that may be achievable in connection with the acquisition or the associated costs that may be necessary to achieve such revenues, synergies or cost savings. The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended November 26, 2021 combines the historical results of operations of SGH for the three months ended November 26, 2021 and the historical results of operations of Stratus Technologies for the three months ended August 29, 2021: Three months ended November 26, 2021 Net sales $ 507,830   Net income attributable to SGH 5,180   Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.11   Diluted $ 0.09   Acquisition-related transaction expenses are included within selling, general and administrative expenses and were $ 4.8
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For the period from the August 29, 2022 acquisition date to November 25, 2022, net sales for Stratus Technologies were $ 45.2
million and net loss was $ 3.2
million, excluding any charges recognized to adjust the Earnout to its fair value. Inventories As of November 25, 2022 August 26, 2022 Raw materials $ 179,520   $ 150,913   Work in process 78,048   38,624   Finished goods 158,514   133,547     $ 416,082   $ 323,084   As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022,

million and $ 9.5
million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Change in Accounting Estimate :
During the first quarter of 2023, we completed an assessment of the estimated useful lives of our manufacturing equipment. Based on that assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives from
five years
to
eight years
as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023. The change reduced our non-cash depreciation expense for the first
13 quarter of 2023 by approximately $ 2.7
million, which resulted in reductions of $ 2.4
million in cost of sales and $ 0.2
million in the cost of our inventories as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The reduction benefited net income by $ 1.3
million, or $ 0.03
per share. Intangible Assets and Goodwill   As of November 25, 2022 As of August 26, 2022   Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets:         Technology $ 150,475   $ ( 25,236 ) $ 61,594   $ ( 18,473 ) Customer relationships 85,300   ( 35,568 ) 57,500   ( 32,238 ) Trademarks/trade names 29,200   ( 10,834 ) 19,200   ( 9,771 )   $ 264,975   $ ( 71,638 ) $ 138,294   $ ( 60,482 )   Goodwill by segment: Intelligent Platform Solutions $ 166,329   $ 40,401   Memory Solutions 33,362   33,608     $ 199,691   $ 74,009   In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, we capitalized $ 126.4

million, respectively, for intangible assets with weighted-average useful lives of
6.0
years and
8.2
years, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 10.9

(collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Original Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides for (i) a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 275.0  million (the “2027 TLA”) and (ii) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 250.0
million (the “2027 Revolver” and together with the 2027 TLA, the “Original Credit Facility”), in each case, maturing on February 7, 2027 (subject to certain earlier “springing maturity” dates upon certain conditions specified in the Original Credit Agreement). The Original Credit Agreement provides that up to $ 35.0  million of the 2027 Revolver is available for issuances of letters of credit. Incremental Amendment :
On August 29, 2022, the Borrowers entered into the First Amendment (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with and among the lenders party thereto and Citizens Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the “Incremental Amendment”). The Incremental Amendment amends the Original Credit Agreement and (i) provides for incremental term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of $ 300.0  million (the “Incremental Term Loans” and together with the 2027 TLA, the “Amended 2027 TLA”) which Incremental Term Loans are on the same terms as the term loans incurred under the Original Credit Agreement, (ii) increases the maximum First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) financial covenant from
3.00 :1.00 to
3.25 :1.00 and (iii) increases the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and permitted investments netted from the definitions of Consolidated First Lien Debt and Consolidated Net Debt under the Amended Credit Agreement from $ 100  million to $ 125  million. Substantially simultaneously with entering into the Incremental Amendment, the Borrowers applied a portion of the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans to (i) finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Stratus Technologies and (ii) prepay in full the $ 101.8
million outstanding under the LED Earnout Note. In connection with our prepayment of the LED Earnout Note, we recognized a gain of $ 0.8  million, which is included in other non-operating (income) expense in the accompanying statement of operations. Other :
As of November 25, 2022, there was $ 569.7
million of principal amount outstanding under the Amended 2027 TLA, unamortized issuance costs were $ 8.2
million and the effective interest rate was
6.35 %. As of November 25, 2022, there were
no
amounts outstanding under the 2027 Revolver. Convertible Senior Notes In February 2020, we issued $ 250.0
million in aggregate principal amount of
2.25 % convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The 2026 Notes are general unsecured obligations, bear interest at an annual rate of
2.25 % per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, and mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2026 Notes are governed by an indenture (the “Indenture”) between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. After the effect of the share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022, the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes is
49.2504
ordinary shares per $ 1,000
principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $ 20.30
per ordinary share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture. First Supplemental Indenture to Indenture Governing the 2026 Notes :
On August 26, 2022, SGH entered into the First Supplemental Indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”) to the Indenture governing the 2026 Notes. The First Supplemental Indenture became effective on August 27, 2022. Pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture, SGH irrevocably elected (i) to eliminate SGH’s option to elect Physical Settlement (as defined in the Indenture) on any conversion
15 of the 2026 Notes that occurs on or after the date of the First Supplemental Indenture and (ii) with respect to any Combination Settlement (as defined in the Indenture) for a conversion of the 2026 Notes, the Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Indenture) that will be settled in cash per $ 1,000
principal amount of the 2026 Notes shall be no lower than $ 1,000 . As a result of our election, upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes, we will be required to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion while continuing to have the option to settle any amount in excess of the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares. Following the irrevocable election, only the amounts expected to be settled in excess of the principal portion are considered in calculating diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method. Other :
Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs are amortized over the term of the 2026 Notes using the effective interest method. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, the effective interest rate was
2.83 % and
7.06 %, respectively. Interest expense for the 2026 Notes consisted of the
2.25 % contractual stated interest and amortization of issuance costs and, for the first quarter of 2022, amortization of discount: Three Months Ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Contractual stated interest $ 1,391   $ 1,391   Amortization of discount and issuance costs 337   2,210   $ 1,728   $ 3,601   As of August 26, 2022, the carrying amount of the equity components of the 2026 Notes, which was included in additional paid-in-capital, was $ 50.8
million. As of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023, we adopted ASU 2020-06. In connection therewith, we reclassified $ 32.2
million from additional paid-in-capital to long-term debt and $ 18.6
million from additional paid-in-capital to retained earnings. See “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.” Leases As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, we had operating leases through which we utilize facilities, offices and equipment in our manufacturing operations, research and development activities and selling, general and administrative functions.
Sublease income was not significant in any period presented.
The components of operating lease expense were as follows: Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Fixed lease cost $ 5,096   $ 3,303   Variable lease cost 384   368   Short-term lease cost 499   76     $ 5,979   $ 3,747   Cash flows used for operating activities in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 included payments for operating leases of $ 2.8
million and $ 2.9
million, respectively. Acquisitions of right-of-use assets were $ 9.4
million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of Stratus Technologies, and were
not
significant in the first quarter of 2022. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term for our operating leases was
10.3
years and
10.9
years, respectively. Certain of our operating leases include one or more options to extend the lease term for periods from
two
to
five years . In determining the present value of our operating lease liabilities, we have assumed we will not extend any lease terms. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, the weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases was
6.2 % and
6.1 %, respectively. 16 Minimum payments of operating lease liabilities as of November 25, 2022 were as follows: Remainder of 2023 $ 9,708   2024 14,274   2025 12,186   2026 10,841   2027 8,629   2028 and thereafter 65,971     121,609   Less imputed interest ( 34,637 ) Present value of total lease liabilities $ 86,972   Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies From time to time, we are involved in legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. Litigation in general, and intellectual property, employment and shareholder litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Additionally, from time to time, we are a party in the normal course of business to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. Equity SGH Shareholders’ Equity Share Dividend On January 3, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a share dividend of
one
ordinary share, $ 0.03
par value per share, for every one outstanding ordinary share owned to shareholders of record as of January 25, 2022. The dividend was paid on February 1, 2022. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been restated and adjusted for the impact of the share dividend. Share Repurchase Authorization On April 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $ 75
million share repurchase authorization, under which we may repurchase our outstanding ordinary shares from time to time through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the first quarter of 2023 and in 2022, we repurchased
0.2
million and
2.6
million shares, respectively, for $ 2.8
million and $ 50.0
million, respectively, under the repurchase authorization. Other Share Repurchases Ordinary shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes and exercise prices in connection with the vesting or exercise of equity awards are treated as ordinary share repurchases. We repurchased
144
thousand and
51
thousand ordinary shares as payment of withholding taxes for $ 1.9
million and $ 2.7
million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Stratus Technologies Earnout In connection with our acquisition of Status Technologies, the Seller has the right to receive an Earnout of up to $ 50.0
million based on the gross profit performance of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing. The Earnout, if any, will be payable in cash, ordinary shares of SGH or a mix of cash and SGH shares, at SGH’s election. 17 At the time of settlement of the Earnout, SGH may elect to pay any portion in SGH shares and, if so, the number of SGH shares issued will be determined based on the volume -weighted average price per SGH share for the
30
consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the date of payment of the Earnout (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of certain changes to SGH shares occurring during such
30
consecutive trading days). Shares issuable pursuant to the Earnout are contingently issuable shares and are considered in the computation of diluted earnings per share if dilutive. The number of contingently issuable shares included in diluted earnings per share is the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable at the time of settlement based on the assumption that the current fair value of the Earnout remains unchanged until the end of the earnout period. As of November 25, 2022, based on the fair value of the Earnout, the contingently issuable shares were anti-dilutive. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the three months ended November 25, 2022 were as follows:   Cumulative Translation Adjustment Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses) on Investments Total As of August 26, 2022 $ ( 221,655 ) $ —   $ —   $ ( 221,655 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 2,008 ) 191   ( 7 ) ( 1,824 ) Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income —   ( 171 ) —   ( 171 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 2,008 ) 20   ( 7 ) ( 1,995 ) As of November 25, 2022 $ ( 223,663 ) $ 20   $ ( 7 ) $ ( 223,650 ) Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiary Noncontrolling interest increased by $ 0.3
million and $ 0.7
million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, for San’an’s
49 % share of net income from the Cree Joint Venture. Cash and other assets of the Cree Joint Venture are generally not available for use by us in our other operations. Government Incentives Brazil Financial Credits Through our Brazil subsidiaries, we participate in
two
programs (“Brazil Incentive Programs”), pursuant to which the Brazilian government incentivizes the manufacture and sale of certain information technology and consumer electronics products within Brazil. The programs include 1) Lei da Informática – Processo Produtivo Básico Program (also known as Informatics Law – Basic Productive Process Program) (“IT Law/PPB”) and 2) Programa de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Indústria de Semicondutores (also known as Program of Support of the Development of the Semiconductor Industry) (“PADIS”). In January 2022, the Brazilian government approved an extension to PADIS. The financial credits available through PADIS are set to expire in December 2026, while the financial credits through IT Law/PPB are set to expire in December 2029. The Brazil Incentive Programs provide for reduced import and other transaction-related taxes for certain procurement, manufacturing and sales activities. In exchange, we must invest in certain research and development activities related to semiconductors and IT solutions in aggregate amounts that minimally meet or exceed a specified percentage of our gross revenues recognized in connection with sales in Brazil, excluding exports and sales to customers located at the Manaus Free Trade Zone. Accordingly, financial credits earned in connection with the Brazil Incentive Programs are reflected as a reduction of research and development expense. Financial credits available under the Brazil Incentive Programs are subject to limitations, which range from approximately
11 % to
14 % of gross revenues recognized for sales in Brazil. Pursuant to the Brazil Incentive Programs, we recognized aggregate financial credits, reflected as a reduction of research and development expense, of $ 2.6
million and $ 5.9
million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Financial
18 credits earned under the Brazil Incentive Programs may be refunded in cash or used to offset liabilities for Brazil federal taxes. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, receivables for earned but unused financial credits were $ 19.0
million and $ 18.7
million, respectively. Financial credits earned but unused as of November 25, 2022 can be utilized through December 2027. Fair Value Measurements Cash and cash equivalents as of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022 included money market funds of $ 64.2
million and $ 13.8
million, respectively, which were valued based on Level 1 measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Restricted cash is included in
other current assets
and was $ 2.8
million as of November 25, 2022.
Fair value measurements were as follows:   As of November 25, 2022 As of August 26, 2022   Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Assets: Derivative financial instrument assets $ 520   $ 520   $ —   $ —   Liabilities: Derivative financial instrument liabilities $ 172   $ 172   $ 605   $ 605   Acquisition-related contingent consideration 24,500   24,500   —   —   Amended 2027 TLA 569,676   561,487   273,281   269,304   2026 Notes 265,038   245,543   290,223   213,023   LED Earnout Note —   —   96,412   101,824   Debt – other 17,357   18,390   17,855   19,263   The fair values of our derivative financial instruments, as measured on a recurring basis, were based on Level 2 measurements, including market-based observable inputs of currency exchange spot and forward rates, interest rates and credit-risk spreads. Acquisition-related contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Stratus Technologies and was included in current liabilities as of November 25, 2022. The fair value as of November 25, 2022, measured on a recurring basis, was based on Level 3 measurements, which included significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis in a risk-neutral framework with assumptions for volatility, market price of risk adjustment, risk-free rate and cost of debt. The fair value of the Earnout was estimated based on the Company’s evaluation of the probability and amount of Earnout to be achieved based on the expected gross profit of Stratus Technologies. The Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the Earnout payment, which was discounted to its present value based on the expected payment date of the Earnout. The model used an estimated gross profit volatility of
33.8 % and a discount rate of
8.8 % as of November 25, 2022. The fair values of our Amended 2027 TLA, LED Earnout Note and other debt, as measured on a non-recurring basis, were estimated based on Level 2 measurements, including discounted cash flows and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. The fair value of the 2026 Notes, as measured on a non-recurring basis, was determined based on Level 2 measurements, including the trading price of the 2026 Notes. Derivative Instruments We use currency forward contracts to mitigate our exposure of certain monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating (income) expense. 19 Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Realized (gains) losses on currency forward contracts $ 1,007   $ ( 3,910 ) Unrealized (gains) losses on currency forward contracts ( 430 ) ( 753 ) Equity Plans As of November 25, 2022,
8.8
million shares of our ordinary shares were available for future awards under our equity plans. Restricted Share Awards and Restricted Share Units Awards (“Restricted Awards”) Aggregate Restricted Award activity was as follows: Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Awards granted 1,010   533 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 19.51   $ 28.02   Aggregate vesting-date fair value of shares vested $ 8,949   $ 11,956   Restricted Awards include grants with service, performance and/or market conditions with restrictions that generally lapse after a
three - to
four-year
service period. Awards with market conditions are based on either the Company’s share price or the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to companies included in a market index. For awards with market conditions, the number of shares that will vest will vary between
0 % and
200 % of target amounts, depending upon the Company’s achievement level over the specified performance period. The fair value of awards with market conditions were fixed at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis and were based on significant inputs not observable in the market. As of November 25, 2022, total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested Restricted Awards was $ 94.6
million, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.7
years. Share Options As of November 25, 2022, total aggregate unrecognized compensation costs for unvested options was $ 2.3
million, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.6
years. Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) Under our ESPP, employees purchased
265
thousand ordinary shares for $ 2.9
million in the first quarter of 2023 and
133
thousand shares for $ 3.0
million in the first quarter of 2022. Share-Based Compensation Expense Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Share-based compensation expense by caption: Cost of sales $ 1,708   $ 1,731   Research and development 1,634   1,540   Selling, general and administrative 7,070   6,504     $ 10,412   $ 9,775   Income tax benefits related to the tax deductions for share-based awards are recognized only upon the settlement of the related share-based awards. Income tax benefits for share-based awards were $ 2.2
million and $ 3.1
million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 20 Revenue and Customer Contract Balances Net Sales and Gross Billings We provide certain logistics services on an agent basis, whereby we procure materials on behalf of our customers and then resell such materials to our customers. Our logistics services business includes procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, kitting and/or packaging services. While we take title to inventory under such arrangements, control of such inventory does not transfer to us as we do not, at any point, have the ability to direct the use, and thereby obtain the benefits of, the inventory. Gross amounts invoiced to customers in connection with these agent services include amounts related to the services performed by us in addition to the cost of the materials procured. However, only the amount related to the agent component is recognized as revenue in our results of operations. We generally recognize revenue for these procurement, logistics and inventory management services upon the completion of such services, which typically occurs at the time of shipment of product to the customer.
The cost of materials billed to our customers under these arrangements, but not recognized as revenue or cost of sales in our results of operations, were as follows: Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Cost of materials $ 377,751   $ 336,275   Customer Contract Balances As of November 25, 2022 August 26, 2022 Contract assets

(3) $ 67,689   $ 39,676   Customer advances 24,097 24,125   $ 91,786   $ 63,801   (1) Contract assets are included in other current assets. (2) Contract liabilities are included in other current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities based on the timing of when our customer is expected to take control of the asset or receive the benefit of the service. (3) Deferred revenue includes $ 19.4
million and $ 23.3
million as of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, respectively, related to contracts that contain termination rights. Deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers in advance of satisfying performance obligations. As of November 25, 2022, we expect to recognize revenue of $ 55.3
million of the balance of $ 67.7
million in the next
12
months and the remaining amount thereafter. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized revenue of $ 14.9
million from satisfying performance obligations related to amounts included in deferred revenue as of August 26, 2022. Customer advances represent amounts received from customers for advance payments to secure product. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized revenue of $ 0.6
million from satisfying performance obligations related to amounts included in customer advances as of August 26, 2022. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, other current liabilities included $ 13.4
million and $ 15.4
million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers, including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns. Other Operating (Income) Expense In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated plans that included workforce reductions and the elimination of certain projects across our businesses. In connection therewith, we recorded a restructure charge of $ 2.0
million, primarily for employee severance costs and other benefits. We anticipate that these activities will continue into subsequent quarters of 2023 and
21 anticipate recording additional restructure charges. As of November 25, 2022, $ 0.1
million remained unpaid, which is expected to be paid in the remainder of 2023. Other Non-operating (Income) Expense Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Foreign currency losses $ 242   $ 1,467   Other ( 902 ) ( 232 )   $ ( 660 ) $ 1,235   Foreign currency losses relate primarily to our Brazil operating subsidiaries. Income Taxes Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Income before income taxes $ 10,214   $ 28,453   Income tax provision 4,890   7,755   Income tax expense includes a provision for federal, state and foreign taxes based on the annual estimated effective tax rate applicable to us and our subsidiaries, adjusted for certain discrete items, which are fully recognized in the period they occur. Accordingly, the interim effective tax rate may not be reflective of the annual estimated effective tax rate. Our provision for income taxes for the three months ended November 25, 2022 decreased by $ 2.9
million as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in profit before tax. As of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, we had a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets associated with our U.S. operations. Management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowances. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates, which involves estimating current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The estimates used could differ from actual results, which may have a significant impact on operating results in future periods. Earnings Per Share Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Net income attributable to SGH – Basic and Diluted $ 4,992   $ 20,027   Weighted-average shares outstanding – Basic 48,962 49,011 Dilutive effect of equity plans and convertible notes 829 5,624 Weighted-average shares outstanding – Diluted 49,791 54,635 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.10   $ 0.41   Diluted $ 0.10   $ 0.37   22 Below are unweighted potentially dilutive shares that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been antidilutive: Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Equity plans 6,072 285 Stratus Technologies contingently issuable shares 1,715 —   7,787 285 Upon any conversion of our 2026 Notes, we will be required to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion while continuing to have the option to settle any amount in excess of the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares. As a result, only the amounts settled in excess of the principal portion are considered in calculating diluted earnings per share. See “Debt – Convertible Senior Notes.” Upon completion of the Earnout period, we will be obligated to pay the Stratus contingent consideration in either cash, ordinary shares of SGH, or a mix of cash and SGH shares. See “Equity – SGH Shareholders’ Equity – Stratus Technologies Earnout.” Segment and Other Information Segment information presented below is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker evaluates operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. We have the following
three
businesses, which are our reportable segments: • Memory Solutions :

Segments are determined based on sources of revenue, types of customers and operating performance. There are no differences between the accounting policies for our segment reporting and our consolidated results of operations. Operating expenses directly associated with the activities of a specific segment are charged to that segment. Certain other indirect operating income and expenses are generally allocated to segments based on their respective percentage of net sales. We do not allocate interest, other non-operating (income) expense or taxes to segments. 23 Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Net sales: Memory Solutions $ 191,967   $ 239,401   Intelligent Platform Solutions 210,971   118,654   LED Solutions 62,540   111,889   Total net sales $ 465,478   $ 469,944   Segment operating income: Memory Solutions $ 21,145   $ 36,670   Intelligent Platform Solutions 34,166   14,180   LED Solutions ( 478 ) 18,300   Total segment operating income 54,833   69,150     Unallocated: Share-based compensation expense ( 10,412 ) ( 9,775 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles ( 10,858 ) ( 6,343 ) Flow through of inventory step up ( 2,599 ) —   Acquisition and integration expenses ( 6,732 ) ( 1,038 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration ( 3,700 ) ( 17,200 ) Restructure charge ( 2,041 ) —   Other ( 900 ) —   Total unallocated ( 37,242 ) ( 34,356 ) Consolidated operating income $ 17,591   $ 34,794   24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the last Friday in August. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. All financial information for our subsidiaries in Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag because their fiscal years end on July 31 of each year. All tabular amounts are in thousands. Overview At SGH, we power growth and expand possibilities by continually investing in our people, innovation and new opportunities. Our diverse lines of businesses – across computing, memory and LED lighting solutions – all focus on serving customers by delivering engineer-driven technology solutions to specialty end markets. SGH serves as a foundation and a support for each of our businesses, while also empowering them to deliver their own unique solutions to their customers to unlock avenues for growth and technological advancement. Since our inception over 30 years ago, SGH has grown into a diversified group of businesses focused on the design and manufacture of specialty solutions for the computing, memory and LED markets. Our success is based on a customer-focused approach characterized by a commitment to quality, advanced technical expertise, quick time-to-market, build-to-order flexibility and excellence in customer service. In addition to driving growth organically and through acquisitions, we use the SGH operating system to support and drive operational efficiency and performance. SGH’s Operating System incorporates best practices to ensure our business lines are empowered to deliver for our customers consistently and efficiently. Acquisition of Stratus Technologies On August 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Storm Private Holdings I Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Stratus Holding Company” and together with its subsidiaries, “Stratus Technologies”). Stratus Technologies, which
25 operates as part of IPS, is a global leader in simplified, protected, and autonomous computing platforms and services in the data center and at the Edge. For more than 40 years, Stratus Technologies has provided high-availability, fault-tolerant computing to Fortune 500 companies and small-to-medium sized businesses enabling them to securely and remotely run critical applications with minimal downtime. At the closing, we paid a cash purchase price of $225 million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the seller has the right to receive, and we will be obligated to pay, contingent consideration (if any) of up to $50 million (the “Earnout”) based on the gross profit performance of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing. The Earnout, if any, will be payable in cash, ordinary shares of SGH or a mix of cash and SGH Shares, at our election. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Business Acquisition – Stratus Technologies.” Factors Affecting Our Operating Performance COVID-19 :
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) has resulted in substantial loss of life, economic disruption and government intervention worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our product lines since early calendar 2020. COVID-19 also disrupted our product development, marketing and corporate development activities, and has more recently affected our supply chain. If these conditions continue, or if we have an outbreak in any of our facilities, sales volumes may be negatively impacted and we may, among other issues, experience, in any or all product lines, delays in product development, a decreased ability to support our customers, disruptions in sales and manufacturing activities and overall reduced productivity each of which could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customer commitments and on our revenue and profitability. The reduction of investment in new capacity due to the pandemic, coupled with strong demand to expand delivery and logistics, internet and cloud services, has resulted in significant supply shortages that may impact our ability to manufacture products for our customers and may result in rising prices of the materials we need to manufacture our products. We may not be able to pass on these rising costs to our customers which could result in a negative impact to our gross margins. Furthermore, if there is a significant outbreak or if travel restrictions or stay-at-home or work remote or from home conditions or other governmental or voluntary restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impact our suppliers’ ability to manufacture or deliver raw materials or provide key components or services, we could experience more delays or reductions in our ability to manufacture and ship products to our customers. While certain segments of our customer base are experiencing strong demand, the pandemic may negatively impact the demand for other segments for our customer base or those customers’ ability to manufacture their products, which could reduce their demand for our products or services. Macro-Economic Demand Factors.
Our business segments each have their own unique set of demand factors. Demand in our Memory Solutions group is driven by end-market demand from OEMs for customer-specific solutions in vertical markets such as industrial, government, networking, high-performance compute and enterprise storage, as well as from OEMs for memory modules used in desktop and notebook computers, smartphones, IoT and SSD products in Brazil. In addition, macro-economic factors specific to the Brazil economy affect this segment, given our sales and operations in that market. Our IPS business is driven by demand for high compute solutions across AI and machine learning initiatives, as well as traditional workload optimization and efficiency applications. Finally, demand for our LED products is derived from targeted end-market applications, such as general high-power and mid-power lighting and specialty lighting, such as video and horticulture applications. We believe our diversified business segments may provide a natural hedge against downturns in any particular industry although broader macro-economic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can adversely affect all three segments concurrently. Shifts in the Mix of Our Revenue.
Shifts in the mix of revenue from our operating segments, which can vary significantly from period to period, can impact our business and operating results, including gross and operating margins. For example, our Memory Solutions group, while not party to long-term fixed purchasing commitments, has nonetheless historically seen relatively stable demand and margins. By contrast, our IPS group has shown solid growth, but is subject to greater variability in its sales and margin profile from period to period, as recognition of revenue is tied to customer decisions as to the completion of delivery and system go-live events, and margin is driven by the extent to which higher margin software and managed services comprise IPS sales. Our resource commitments and planning for each segment are relatively fixed in the short term, and as such, variability in expected revenue mix will have direct implications for our operating income and margins. Our Ability to Identify, Complete and Successfully Integrate Acquisitions.
A substantial portion of our growth over the last several years has been driven by acquisitions, and we intend to continue to use corporate development as an engine for growth. Within our existing segments, we plan to pursue acquisitions to expand features and functionality, expand into adjacent businesses and grow our customer base and geographic footprint. From time to time, we may seek to expand our
26 addressable market by entering new business segments where, as we did with our LED business and our recently acquired Stratus Technologies business, we identify a business opportunity at scale with a path to being accretive to our overall operations in the near term. If we are unable to identify and complete attractive acquisitions, we may not be successful in growing our revenue and/or expanding our margins. Any acquisitions we do complete may require us to incur debt or raise capital through equity financings or may subject us to unforeseen liabilities or operational challenges that in turn impede our ability to realize the expected returns on our investment. Disruptions in Our Supply Chain May Adversely Affect Our Businesses.
We depend on third-party suppliers for key components of our products, such as commodity DRAM components from offshore foundries that we use in our specialty memory products and third-party wafers that we use in our memory and LED businesses. We have adopted this “Fab-Light” business model to reduce our capital expenditures and operating expenses, while affording greater flexibility in adapting to shifts in demand and other market trends. However, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risk of supply chain disruption and lost business. If such disruptions worsen or are prolonged, or if there is meaningful disruption in our supply arrangement with any of our third-party suppliers, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Net Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Net sales decreased by $4.5 million, or 1.0%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to weakness in both our Memory Solutions and LED Solutions businesses, offset by strong performance from IPS. IPS net sales increased by $92.3 million, or 77.8%, due to higher sales in our Penguin Solutions business and from $45.2 million of revenue from our recent acquisition of the Stratus Technologies business. Memory Solutions sales decreased by $47.4
27 million, or 19.8%, primarily due to lower sales volumes of DRAM products (mainly in Brazil). LED Solutions sales decreased by $49.3 million, or 44.1%, primarily due to weak customer demand. Cost of sales was relatively flat in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year. Lower costs of material and production from lower sales of our Memory Solutions and LED Solutions segments were offset by additional costs from the operations of our recently-acquired Stratus Technologies business. Gross margin decreased to 25.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 26.0% in in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower sales and gross profits for our Memory Solutions and LED Solutions businesses, partially offset by strength in our IPS business, which included higher margins of our recently-acquired Stratus Technologies business. Change in Accounting Estimate :
During the first quarter of 2023, we completed an assessment of the estimated useful lives of our manufacturing equipment. Based on that assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives from five years to eight years as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023. The change reduced our non-cash depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2023 by approximately $2.7 million, which resulted in reductions of $2.4 million in cost of sales and $0.2 million in the cost of our inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP Measure of Segment Operating Income Below is a table of our operating income, measured on a non-GAAP basis, which our management uses to supplement SGH’s financial results under GAAP to analyze its operations and make decisions as to future operational plans. Our management believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, such as share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (consisting of amortization of developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks/trade names and backlog acquired in connection with business combinations), acquisition-related inventory adjustments, acquisition-related expenses, restructure charges and integration expenses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and other infrequent or unusual items. While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is reflected in our non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment and Other Information.” Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about our financial results, as noted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 GAAP operating income $ 17,591  $ 34,794  Share-based compensation expense 10,412  9,775  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 10,858  6,343  Flow-through of inventory step up 2,599  —  Acquisition and integration expenses 6,732  1,038  Change in fair value of contingent consideration 3,700  17,200  Restructure charge 2,041  —  Other 900  —  Non-GAAP operating income $ 54,833  $ 69,150  Non-GAAP operating income by segment:     Memory Solutions $ 21,145  $ 36,670  Intelligent Platform Solutions 34,166  14,180  LED Solutions (478) 18,300  Total non-GAAP operating income by segment $ 54,833  $ 69,150  28 Memory Solutions operating income decreased by $15.5 million, or 42.3%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower sales and gross profit. IPS operating income increased by $20.0 million, or 140.9%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher sales and margins from our Penguin Solutions business and strong performance from our Stratus Technologies business, partially offset by higher operating expenses from the Stratus Technologies acquisition and higher personnel-related expenses for increased headcount to support IPS’ revenue growth. LED Solutions operating income decreased by $18.8 million, or 102.6%, in 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower sales and gross profit from lower sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses mainly driven by personnel-related expenses due to lower headcount. Operating and Non-operating (Income) Expense Research and Development Research and development expense increased by $6.4 million, or 36.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $6.0 million of costs from the operations of our recently-acquired Stratus Technologies business and a decrease of $3.3 million in the Brazil financial credits, which are reflected as a reduction of research and development expenses. The first quarter of 2023 also had lower personnel-related expenses. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2023 as we include the operations of our Stratus Technologies acquisition and lower Brazil financial credits. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $18.5 million, or 35.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $14.5 million of costs from the operations of our recently-acquired Stratus Technologies business and as well as higher acquisition and integration expenses. We expect selling, general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2023 as we include the operations of our Stratus Technologies acquisition. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Our acquisitions of Stratus Technologies in the first quarter of 2023 and our LED Business in the third quarter of 2021 each included contingent consideration. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the date of acquisition and subsequently recognize changes in the fair value in income from operations. During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a charge of $3.7 million to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration from our acquisition of Stratus Technologies as of November 25, 2022. During the first quarter of 2022 , we recorded a charge of $17.2 million to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration from our acquisition of the LED business as of November 26, 2021. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Business Acquisition – Stratus Technologies.” Other Operating (Income) Expense Other operating expense in the first quarter of 2023 consists of a restructure charge of $2.0 million, primarily for employee severance costs and other benefits resulting from workforce reductions and the elimination of certain projects across our businesses. We anticipate that these activities will continue into subsequent quarters of 2023 and anticipate recording additional restructure charges. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense increased by $2.9 million, or 57.4%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to interest expense from the Amended 2027 TLA Credit Facility. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” Other Non-operating (Income) Expense Other non-operating (income) expense in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected foreign currency (gains) and losses related to our Brazil operating subsidiaries and, for the first quarter of 2023, a gain from the prepayment of the LED Earnout Note. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Other Non-operating (Income) Expense” and “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Credit Facility.” 29 Income Tax Provision Our provision for income taxes decreased by $2.9 million, or 36.9%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in profit before tax. Liquidity and Capital Resources At November 25, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $324.8 million, of which $173.7 million was held outside of the United States. Our principal uses of cash and capital resources have been acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and working capital requirements. We expect that future capital expenditures will focus on expanding our research and development activities, manufacturing equipment upgrades, acquisitions and IT infrastructure and software upgrades. Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of funds held in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, borrowings available under our credit facilities and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing. Any future equity financing may be dilutive to our existing investors, and any future debt financing may include debt service requirements and financial and other restrictive covenants that may constrain our operations and growth strategies. In the event that we seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition. Credit Facility On August 29, 2022, we amended our credit facility and borrowed an additional $300 million, which amount was added to our existing term loan. The incremental term loans are on the same terms as the term loans incurred under the original credit agreement. In addition, we amended certain covenants under the amended credit agreement. In the first quarter of 2023, we applied a portion of the proceeds of the incremental term loans to (i) finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Stratus Technologies and (ii) pay in full the $101.8 million outstanding under the LED Earnout Note. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Credit Facility.” Convertible Senior Notes On August 26, 2022, we irrevocably elected (i) to eliminate our option to elect Physical Settlement (as defined in the Indenture) on any conversion of our 2026 Notes that occurs on or after August 27, 2022 and (ii) with respect to any Combination Settlement (as defined in the Indenture) for a conversion of the 2026 Notes, the Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Indenture) that will be settled in cash per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes shall be no lower than $1,000. As a result of our election, upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes, we will be required to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion while continuing to have the option to settle any amount in excess of the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Convertible Senior Notes.” Acquisition of Stratus Technologies On August 29, 2022, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Stratus Technologies. At the closing of the transaction, we paid the seller a cash purchase price of $225 million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the seller has the right to receive, and we will be obligated to pay, contingent consideration (if any) of up to $50 million based on the gross profit performance of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing. The Earnout, if any, will be payable in cash, ordinary shares of SGH or a mix of cash and SGH Shares, at our election. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Business Acquisition – Stratus Technologies.” 30 Cash Flows Three months ended November 25, 2022 November 26, 2021 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ (73,985) $ 15,146  Net cash used for investing activities (223,643) (13,377) Net cash provided by financing activities 261,979  12,363  Effect of changes in currency exchange rates 205  (4,068) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (35,444) $ 10,064  Operating Activities :
Cash flows from operating activities reflects net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation, adjustments for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, gains and losses from investing or financing activities and from the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used for operating activities in the first quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from net income of $5.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $34.5 million. Operating cash flows were adversely affected by a $113.8 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily from the effects of a decrease of $83.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase of $82.9 million in inventories and the payment of $73.7 million of contingent consideration related to our 2021 acquisition of the LED business, partially offset by the effect of an decrease of $129.7 million in accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and accounts receivable were primarily due to the timing of payments and receipts. Inventories increased primarily to support our IPS business. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2022 resulted primarily from net income of $20.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $44.9 million. Operating cash flows were adversely affected by a $50.5 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily from the effects of a decrease of $55.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities and an increase of $39.6 million in accounts receivable, partially offset by the effect of a $36.1 million decrease in inventories. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities was due to the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable and decrease in inventories was primarily due to higher gross sales in our Memory Solutions and IPS segments. Investing Activities :
Net cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2023 consisted primarily of $210.3 million for the acquisition of Stratus Technologies and $11.6 million for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2022 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities :
Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2023 consisted primarily of $295.3 million in net proceeds from issuance of a term loan and $3.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares from our equity plans, partially offset by a $28.1 million payment of contingent consideration related to our 2021 acquisition of the LED business, 4.7 million of payments to acquire ordinary shares (including $2.8 million under our share repurchase program) and $4.5 million in principal payments of debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2022 was consisted primarily of $10.0 million in net repayments of borrowings under our line of credit and $2.7 million used to repurchase our ordinary shares, partially offset by $5.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see “PART II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2022. 31 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk We are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Our international sales and our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates. Because a significant portion of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, possibly leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. In addition, we have certain costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in increases in such costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As a result of our international operations, we generate a portion of our net sales and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the Brazilian real. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, and we translate the assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses of a substantial portion of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our customer pricing and material cost of sales are generally based on U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the impact of currency fluctuations to our consolidated statements of operations is primarily to our other costs of sales (i.e., non-material components) and our operating expenses as those items are typically denominated in local currency. Our consolidated statements of operations are also impacted by foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and equity. As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our reported results. Approximately 16% and 24% of our net sales in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, originated in Brazilian real. We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency-denominated liabilities in Brazil, primarily third party payables. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Based on our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as of November 25, 2022 and August 26, 2022, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses recorded in non-operating (income) expense of $8.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively, to revalue these assets and liabilities. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable-rate debt. As of November 25, 2022, we had $569.7 million principal amount outstanding under the Amended 2027 TLA. In addition, our Amended Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $250.0 million under the 2027 Revolver. Assuming that we would satisfy the financial covenants required to borrow and that the amounts available under the 2027 Revolver were fully drawn, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense and a decrease in our cash flows of $8.2 million per year. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 25, 2022 to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
32 overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 33 PART II.
