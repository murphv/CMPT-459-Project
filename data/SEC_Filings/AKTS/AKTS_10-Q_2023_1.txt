AKOUSTIS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1. Organization
Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (the
“Company”) was incorporated on April 10, 2013, and effective December 15, 2016, the Company changed its state of
incorporation to the State of Delaware. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Akoustis, Inc. (a Delaware corporation), the Company,
headquartered in Huntersville, North Carolina, is focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative radio frequency
(“RF”) filter products for the wireless industry, including for products such as smartphones and tablets, cellular
infrastructure equipment, Wi-Fi Customer Premise Equipment (“CPE”), and military and defense communication applications.
Located between the device’s antenna and its digital backend, the RF front-end (“RFFE”) is the circuitry that
performs the analog signal processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. To construct the resonator
devices that are the building blocks for its RF filters, the Company has developed a family of novel, high purity acoustic
piezoelectric materials as well as a unique microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) wafer semiconductor process,
collectively referred to as XBAW TM
technology. The Company leverages its integrated device manufacturing
(“IDM”) business model to develop and sell high performance RF filters using its XBAW TM
technology. Filters
are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation in the modules defining the RFFE.
Additionally, through RFM Integrated Device, Inc. (“RFMi”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akoustis, Inc., the Company
makes sales of complementary surface acoustic wave (“SAW”) resonators, RF filters, crystal (Xtal) resonators and
oscillators, and ceramic products branded as “RFMi” products.
Note 2. Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash
and cash equivalents of $ 46.6
million and working capital of $ 51.5
million. The Company has historically incurred recurring operating
losses and experienced net cash used in operating activities.
On January 19, 2023, the Company closed an underwritten
public offering of
12,545,454
shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $ 2.75
per share, which included the underwriters’
exercise of their over-allotment option in full, for net proceeds of approximately $ 32.0
million. See Note 18-Subsequent Events.
The Company expects cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to fund
its operations beyond the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. These funds will be used to fund the Company’s
operations, including capital expenditures, R&D, commercialization of its technology, development of its patent strategy and expansion
of its patent portfolio, servicing outstanding debt, potential strategic transactions, as well as to provide working capital and funds
for other general corporate purposes. Except for the $ 48.0
million of common stock remaining available to be sold under its ATM Sales
Agreement with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, and Roth Capital Partners, LLC, the Company has no commitments
or arrangements to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance such funds will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
If the Company is unable to obtain additional
financing in a timely fashion and on acceptable terms, its financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected and it may not be able to continue operations or execute its stated commercialization plan.
Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information
and the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-Q. Operating results for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023 or any future
interim period. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September
12, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”).
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, Akoustis, Inc. and RFM Integrated Device, Inc.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
5
Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s significant accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the 2022 Annual Report. Since the date of the 2022
Annual Report, there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies. The preparation of the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
thereto. The policies, estimates and assumptions include valuing equity securities, derivative liabilities, deferred taxes and
related valuation allowances, contingent consideration, goodwill, intangible assets, revenue recognition, and the fair values of
long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from the estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements.
Note 4. Revenue Recognition from Contracts
with Customers
Disaggregation of Revenue
The Company’s primary revenue streams include
foundry fabrication services and product sales across multiple geographic regions, primarily the Americas, Asia and Europe.
Foundry Fabrication Services
Foundry fabrication services revenue includes MEMS foundry services, which the Company exited in fiscal year 2021, and Non-Recurring
Engineering (“NRE”). Under these contracts, products are delivered to the customer at the completion of the service, which
represents satisfaction of the performance obligation as well as transfer of title. Depending on language with regards to enforceable
right to payment for performance completed to date, related revenue will either be recognized over time or at a point in time.
Product Sales
Product sales revenue consists of sales of RF
filters and amps which are sold with contract terms stating that title passes, and the customer takes control, at the time of shipment.
Revenue is then recognized when the devices are shipped, and the performance obligation has been satisfied. If devices are sold under
contract terms that specify that the customer does not take ownership until the goods are received, revenue is recognized when the customer
receives the goods.

The Company records a receivable when the title
for goods has transferred. Generally, all sales are contract sales (with either an underlying contract or purchase order), resulting
in all receivables being contract receivables. When invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition a contract liability is recorded (as
deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets). The amount of revenue recognized in the six months ended December 31,
2022, that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $ 286
thousand which related to timing of shipments.
Contract assets are recorded when revenue recognized
exceeds the amount invoiced. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract assets and contract
liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment. The
amount of contract assets invoiced in the six months ended December 31, 2022, that was included in the opening contract asset balance
was $ 245
thousand, which primarily related to non-recurring engineering services.
Backlog of Remaining Customer Performance
Obligations
Revenue expected to be recognized and recorded as sales
during the remainder of this fiscal year from the backlog of performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied)
at December 31, 2022 was $ 7.4
million. The Company’s backlog may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of
major new contract commitments. In addition, our customers have the right, under some infrequent circumstances, to terminate contracts
or defer the timing of the Company's services and their payments to us.

The Company recorded depreciation expense of
$ 2.3
million and $ 1.6
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded depreciation
expense of $ 4.4
million and $ 3.1
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, equipment with a net book
value totaling $ 7.0
million had not been placed in service and therefore was not depreciated during the period. As of June 30, 2022, fixed
assets with a net book value totaling $ 14.5

Note 7. Business Acquisition
On October 15, 2021, the Company acquired a majority
ownership position in RFMi, a fabless supplier of acoustic wave RF resonators and filters, to expand product offerings and provide access
to new markets. The Company acquired a
51 % ownership interest in RFMi from Tai-Saw Technology Co., Ltd. (“TST”) in exchange
for $ 6.0
million in cash and approximately $ 2.3
million payable in common stock of the Company. On April 29, 2022, the Company exercised
its option to acquire the remaining
49 % ownership interest in RFMi from TST for an additional $ 3.5
million in cash and approximately
420,053
shares of common stock of the Company with a fair value at closing of $ 1.9
million.
Additionally, earn-out payments payable in cash
and/or shares of common stock of the Company may be payable to TST based on the achievement of sales targets for RFMi products in each
of calendar year 2022 and 2023, with potential payouts in the range of $ 0
to $ 3.0
million. The initial $ 1.1
million estimated fair value
of the associated liability was based on the present value of the expected future payouts resulting from the projected RFMi product sales,
applying a volatility rate of
30 % against those future projected revenues and using a discount rate of
9.9 % and
10.2 % for the first and
second earnouts, respectively, and thus represented a Level 3 fair value measurement. The contingent consideration is re-measured to fair
value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, and those changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The Company
has determined that the sales targets for calendar year 2022 were not met and the related earnout payment is not owed. The fair value
of the contingent consideration decreased $ 1,170
thousand during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Pro Forma Results
The following unaudited pro forma financial information

of July 1, 2021 (in thousands). The pro forma results were calculated applying the Company’s accounting policies and include the
effects of adjustments related to the amortization charges from the acquired intangibles. The unaudited pro forma information does not
purport to be indicative of the results that would have been obtained if the acquisitions had actually occurred at the beginning of the
year prior to acquisition, nor of the results that may be reported in the future.

Note 8. Goodwill
The Company performs an annual test for goodwill
impairment during our last fiscal quarter. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company did not identify any events or circumstances that would require an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company does not
amortize goodwill as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life. The carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2022
was $ 8.1
million.

Leases
The Company leases office space in Huntersville,
NC, Carrollton, Texas and Taiwan and leases equipment in Canandaigua, NY. Its leases have remaining lease terms of up to five years, some
of which include options to extend the leases for up to twenty-four months. Following adoption of ASC 842, lease expense excludes capital
area maintenance and property taxes. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the lease pertaining to the office space in Carrollton,
Texas was extended for an additional five years. This resulted in the remeasurement of the respective right of use asset and corresponding
right of use liability.

Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies
Ontario County Industrial Development Authority
Agreement
On February 27, 2018, the Company entered into
a Lease and Project Agreement (the “Lease and Project Agreement”) and a Company Lease Agreement (the “Company Lease
Agreement” and together with the Lease and Project Agreement, the “Agreements”), each dated as of February 1, 2018,
with the Ontario County Industrial Development Agency, a public benefit corporation of the State of New York (the “OCIDA”).
Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company will lease for $1.00 annually to the OCIDA an approximately 9.995 acre parcel of land in Canandaigua,
New York, together with the improvements thereon (including the Company’s New York fabrication facility), and transfer title to
certain related equipment and personal property to the OCIDA (collectively, the “Facility”).
The OCIDA will lease the Facility
back to the Company for annual rent payments specified in the Lease and Project Agreement for the Company’s primary use as research
and development, manufacturing, warehouse and professional office space in its business, and to be subleased, in part, by the Company
to various existing tenants.
The Company estimates substantial tax savings during the term of the Agreements, which expire on December
31, 2028.
In addition, subject to the terms of the Lease and Project Agreement, certain purchases and leases of eligible items will be
exempt from the imposition of sales and use taxes. Subject to the terms of the Lease and Project Agreement, the OCIDA has also granted
to the Company an exemption from certain mortgage recording taxes for one or more mortgages securing an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $ 12.0
million, or such greater amount as approved by the OCIDA in its sole and absolute discretion. Benefits totaling approximately
$ 0.3
million provided to the Company through December 31, 2022 pursuant to the terms of the Lease and Project Agreement are subject to
claw back over the life of the Agreements upon certain recapture events, including certain events of default.
Litigation, Claims and Assessments
On October 4, 2021, the Company was named as a defendant
in a complaint filed by Qorvo, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging, among other things, patent
infringement, false advertising, false patent marking, and unfair competition. The complaint alleges that the defendants misappropriated
proprietary information, made misleading statements about the characteristics of certain of its products, and sold products infringing
on certain of the plaintiff’s patents. The plaintiff seeks an injunction enjoining the Company from the alleged infringement and
damages, including punitive and statutory enhanced damages, in an unspecified amount. The Company filed a motion to dismiss all of the
claims other than the direct patent infringement claims, but the court permitted the plaintiff to file an amended complaint which the
court subsequently determined was sufficient for pleading purposes. The Court dismissed the Company’s motion in May 2022. The Court
held a claims construction hearing in November 2022. At present the Company believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend
against it vigorously. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of such dispute, and such action may result in
judgments against the Company for an injunction, significant damages or other relief, such as future royalty payments to Qorvo, Inc. or
restrictions on certain of the Company’s activities. Resolution of such matter may be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate result
or judgment is uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Even if ultimately settled or resolved in
the Company’s favor, this and other possible future actions may result in significant expenses, diversion of management and technical
personnel attention and disruptions and delays in the Company’s business and product development, and other collateral consequences,
all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Any out-of-court settlement
of this or other actions may also have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations,
including, but not limited to, substantial expenses, the payment of royalties, licensing or other fees payable to third parties, or restrictions
on its ability to develop, manufacture and sell its products.
From time to time, the Company may become involved
in lawsuits, investigations and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses
against all pending claims and intends to vigorously pursue them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of any
pending actions, the Company believes the amount of liability, if any, with respect to such actions, would not materially affect its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
14
Tax Credit Contingency
The Company accrues a liability for indirect tax
contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount
of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal
counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company’s views on the probable outcomes
of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company’s accrued liabilities would be
recorded in the period in which such determination is made.
The Company’s gross unrecognized indirect
tax credits totaled $ 0.1
million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 0.1
million as of June 30, 2022 and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as a long-term liability.
Note 15. Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or
decision–making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision
maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company operates in two segments, Foundry Fabrication Services, which consists of engineering
review services and STC-MEMS foundry services, and RF Filters, which consists of amplifier and filter product sales, and grant revenue.
The Company records all general and administrative costs in the RF Filters segment.
The Company evaluates performance of its operating
segments based on revenue and operating profit (loss). Segment information for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021

Note 16. Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by
dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for
the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, which is the case for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements, the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The Company had the following common stock equivalents
at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Note 17. Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. It focuses on the exit price in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. A three-tier
fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in
measuring fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are as follows:
Level 1: Observable prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
The following table classifies the liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022:

The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities
that was classified as Level 3 in the table above was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation in an option pricing framework with significant
inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The significant
inputs in the Level 3 measurement not supported by market activity include the probability assessments of expected future sales revenue
of RFMi products in calendar year 2023 and the volatility of those revenues, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated
with the obligation, and as calculated in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreements. The development and determination of
the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and the fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company’s
chief financial officer and are approved by the chief executive officer.

Overview
Akoustis® is an emerging commercial product company
focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative RF filter solutions for the wireless industry, including for products such
as smartphones and tablets, network infrastructure equipment, Wi-Fi Customer Premise Equipment (“CPE”) and defense applications.
Filters are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation in the modules defining the RF
front-end (“RFFE”). Located between the device’s antenna and its digital backend, the RFFE is the circuitry that performs
the analog signal processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. We have developed a proprietary microelectromechanical
system (“MEMS”) based bulk acoustic wave (“BAW”) technology and a unique manufacturing process flow, called “XBAW ® ”,
for our filters produced for use in RFFE modules. Our XBAW ®
filters incorporate optimized high purity piezoelectric materials
for high power, high frequency and wide bandwidth operation. We are developing RF filters for 5G, Wi-Fi and defense bands using our proprietary
resonator device models and product design kits (PDKs). As we qualify our RF filter products, we are engaging with target customers to
evaluate our filter solutions. Our initial designs target UHB, sub 7 GHz 5G, Wi-Fi and defense bands. We expect our filter solutions will
address problems (such as loss, bandwidth, power handling, and isolation) created by the growing number of frequency bands in the RFFE
of mobile devices, infrastructure and premise equipment to support 5G, and Wi-Fi. We have prototyped, sampled and begun commercial shipment
of our single-band low loss BAW filter designs for 5G frequency bands and 5 GHz and 6 GHz Wi-Fi bands which are suited to competitive
BAW solutions and historically cannot be addressed with low-band, lower power handling surface acoustic wave (“SAW”) technology.
Additionally, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RFMi, which we acquired majority ownership in October 2021 and full ownership in April
2022, we operate a fabless business whereby we make sales of complementary SAW resonators, RF filters, crystal (“Xtal”) resonators
and oscillators, and ceramic products—addressing opportunities in multiple end markets, such as automotive and industrial applications.
We also offer back-end semiconductor supply chain services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Grinding & Dicing Services, Inc.,
which we acquired in January 2023.
We own and/or have filed applications for patents
on the core resonator device technology, manufacturing facility and intellectual property (“IP”) necessary to produce our
RF filter chips and operate as a “pure-play” RF filter supplier, providing discrete filter solutions direct to Original Equipment
Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and aligning with the front- end module manufacturers that seek to acquire high performance filters
to expand their module businesses. We believe this business model is the most direct and efficient means of delivering our solutions to
the market.
Technology . Our device technology
is based upon bulk-mode acoustic resonance, which we believe is superior to surface-mode resonance for high-band and ultra-high- band
(“UHB”) applications that include 4G/LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, and defense applications. Although some of our target customers utilize
or manufacture the RFFE module, they may lack access to critical UHB filter technology that we produce, which is necessary to compete
in high frequency applications.
Manufacturing . We currently
manufacture Akoustis’ high-performance RF filter circuits, using our first generation XBAW ®
wafer process, in our
125,000-square foot wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, New York (the “NY Facility”), which we acquired in
June 2017. Our SAW-based RF filter products are manufactured by a third party and sold either directly or through a sales distributor.
Intellectual Property.
As of January 27, 2023, our IP portfolio included 80 patents, including
a blocking patent that we have licensed from Cornell University. Additionally, as of January 27, 2023, we have 127 pending patent applications.
These patents cover our XBAW ®
RF filter technology from raw materials through the system architectures.
By designing, manufacturing, and marketing our
RF filter products to mobile phone OEMs, defense OEMs, network infrastructure OEMs, and Wi-Fi CPE OEMs, we seek to enable broader competition
among the front-end module manufacturers.
Since we own and/or have filed applications for
patents on the core technology and control access to our intellectual property, we expect to offer several ways to engage with potential
customers. First, we intend to engage with multiple wireless markets, providing standardized filters that we design and offer as standard
catalog components. Second, we expect to deliver unique filters to customer-supplied specifications, which we will design and fabricate
on a customized basis. Finally, we may offer our models and design kits for our customers to design their own filters utilizing our proprietary
technology.
We expect to continue to incur substantial costs
for commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves materials and solid-state device technology
development and engineering of catalog and custom filter design solutions. To succeed across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW,
and RFMi products, we must convince customers in a wide range of industries including mobile phone OEMs, RFFE module manufacturers, network
infrastructure OEMs, WiFi CPE OEMs, medical device makers, automotive and defense customers to use our products in their systems and modules.
For example, since there are two dominant BAW filter suppliers in the industry that have high-band technology, and both utilize such technology
as a competitive advantage at the module level, we expect customers that lack access to high-band filter technology will be open to engage
with our company for XBAW filters.
19
To help drive our XBAW filter business, we plan
to continue to pursue RF filter design and R&D development agreements and potentially joint ventures with target customers and other
strategic partners, although we cannot guarantee we will be successful in these efforts. These types of arrangements may subsidize technology
development costs and qualification, filter design costs, and offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues
to revenue. However, we intend to retain ownership of our core XBAW technology, intellectual property, designs, and related improvements.
Across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products, we expect to continue development of catalog designs for multiple
customers and to offer such catalog products in multiple sales channels.
Business Environment and Current Trends
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
Although the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business is unknown, in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive, precautionary action,
including when warranted by state and local guidelines. Our actions continue to evolve in response to new government measures and scientific
knowledge regarding COVID-19. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have also enacted various
measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence,
and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. These measures have impacted the method and timing of certain business
meetings and deliverables to certain customers, as well as our ability to obtain certain materials, equipment and services from suppliers.
These actions and the global health crisis caused
by COVID-19 have negatively impacted business activity across the globe. We have observed declining demand and price reductions in the
electronics industry as business and consumer activity has decelerated. Additionally, COVID-19 has contributed to some of the delays we
have observed in certain suppliers’ shipment of materials necessary for us to manufacture our products and in certain vendors’
ability to deliver equipment for installation at our facilities. When COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate that its effects
on global commerce will subside; however, the timing and extent of this is uncertain. We will continue to actively monitor the situation
and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers,
partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the ultimate effects
any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on
our financial results for the remainder of fiscal year 2023 or beyond.
Semiconductor Shortages and Supply Chain Issues
The global silicon semiconductor industry is experiencing
a shortage in supply and difficulties in ability to meet customer demand. This shortage has led to an increase in lead-times of production
of semiconductor chips and components. As our business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of products requiring semiconductors,
as well as the current and anticipated production of these products, we have sought to manage the impact of supply shortages though carefully
maintaining and increasing key inventory levels. In some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended
our purchase commitments or placed non-cancellable orders with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions
are inaccurate. We believe the global supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our business and financial results will persist
through calendar year 2023. We expect these constrained supply conditions to increase our costs of goods sold and increase uncertainty
with respect to the timing of delivery of specific customer orders.
Effects of Inflation and Recession Fears
Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in
the U.S. and the global economy such as rising interest rates, energy prices and recession fears are creating a complex and challenging
business environment. Inflationary pressures, including increased costs of labor and goods included in our supply chain, have negatively
impacted our revenue, operating margins and net income and may continue to do so through the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally,
we have observed certain customers reduce or defer orders, citing negative economic forecasts.
Recent Legislation
On August 9, 2022, President Biden signed into
law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which appropriates funds to support the construction of semiconductor plants in the United States
and advancement of United States semiconductor research and development. The Company is evaluating the provisions of the new law and its
potential impact to the Company.

of its manufacturing facility in Canandaigua, New York.
The Company has incurred losses and negative cash
flow from operations since inception. Our operations thus far have been funded primarily with sales of equity and debt securities, as
well as contract research and government grants, foundry services and engineering services. We expect our operating expenditures to continue
to increase to support future growth of our manufacturing capabilities and expansion of our product offerings, as well as an increase
in research and development and headcount costs to support this growth. We believe we currently have sufficient resources to fund operations
and planned investments for at least the next twelve months. However, until we are able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
to achieve and maintain profitability and meet our obligations as they come due, we may need to raise additional capital to support our
business. In June 2022, we completed an offering of convertible notes resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $43.7 million. In January
2023, we completed a public offering of our common stock raising $32.0 million in net proceeds. Also in January 2023, approximately $14
million in cash was paid to the sellers in the GDSI acquisition as mentioned in Footnote 18. Additionally, the Company estimates that
approximately $5.0 million of additional cash is needed to complete construction in progress assets that are currently not in service.
We also have access to an at-the-market offering program pursuant to which we may sell up to $50 million of Common Stock. As of the date
of this Quarterly Report, the Company had sold $2.0 million of Common Stock under such at-the-market offering program and previously announced
that it was suspending sales under the at-the-market offering program. If, in the future, the Company determines to resume sales under
the at-the-market offering program, it intends to notify investors by the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K or other public announcement.
Balance Sheet and Working Capital
The Company had $46.6 million of cash and cash
equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2022, which reflects a decrease of $33.9 million compared to $80.5 million as of June 30, 2022.
The decrease is primarily due to cash used in operations of $26.1 million and cash used for investing activities of $8.1 million. The
Company estimates that cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its operations, including current capital expense commitments, beyond the
next twelve months from the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. However, the Company has historically incurred recurring operating losses
and will continue to do so until it generates sufficient revenues from operations; as a result, we may need to obtain additional capital
through the sale of additional equity securities, debt, or otherwise, to fund operations past that date. There is no assurance that the
Company’s projections and estimates are accurate. The Company is actively managing and controlling its cash outflows to mitigate
liquidity risks.
December 31, 2022 compared to June 30, 2022
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had current
assets of $60.3 million, made up primarily of cash on hand of $46.6 million. As of June 30, 2022, current assets were $91.7 million comprised
primarily of cash on hand of $80.5 million.
Property, Plant and Equipment was $54.4 million
as of December 31, 2022 as compared to a balance of $51.2 million as of June 30, 2022.
Total assets as of December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022 were $132.3 million and $161.3 million, respectively.
Current liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022 were $8.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively.
Long-term liabilities totaled $44.4 million as
of December 31, 2022, compared to $45.3 million as of June 30, 2022.
Equity was $79.1 million as of December 31, 2022,
compared to $103.4 million as of June 30, 2022, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 23.5%. This decrease was primarily due to the net loss
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $30.2 million which was partially offset by the increase in additional paid-in-capital (“APIC”)
of $5.9 million. The increase in APIC was primarily due to common stock issued for services.
23
Cash Flow Analysis
Operating activities used cash of $26.1 million
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and $23.5 million during the comparative period ended December 31, 2021. The $2.6 million
period-over-period increase in cash used was attributable to higher general and administrative expenses associated legal and professional
fees.
Investing activities used cash of $8.1 million
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $16.6 million for the comparative period ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
of $8.5 million was primarily due to a $4.8 million decrease in purchases of capital equipment as well as a $4.1 million decrease in cash
paid for investment in subsidiary related to the purchase of RFMi during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Financing activities decreased by $19 million
compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock.

ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2022, our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
