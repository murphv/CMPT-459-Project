BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Fiscal Year VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the “Company”) uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. The Company's current fiscal year runs from April 3, 2022 through April 1, 2023 ("Fiscal 2023"). Accordingly, this Form 10-Q presents our third quarter of Fiscal 2023. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended December 2022 and December 2021 relate to the fiscal periods ended on December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. References to March 2022 relate to information as of April 2, 2022.
Basis of Presentation On June 28, 2021, VF completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business was comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses:
Red Kap ® ,
VF Solutions ® ,
Bulwark ® ,
Workrite ® ,
Walls ® ,
Terra ® ,
Kodiak ® ,
Work Authority ®
and
Horace Small ® . The business also included the license of certain
Dickies ®
occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. The results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, through the date of sale. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion within these notes to the interim consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on discontinued operations.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the Fiscal 2023 presentation.
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. Similarly, the March 2022 consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of VF for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three and nine months ended December 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for Fiscal 2023. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in VF’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 2, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K”). Use of Estimates In preparing the interim consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The duration and severity of the challenging macroeconomic environment, the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the related impacts on VF's business are subject to uncertainty; however, the estimates and assumptions made by management are based on available information. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant Accounting Policies Supply Chain Financing Program During the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF reinstated its voluntary supply chain finance ("SCF") program. The SCF program enables a significant portion of our suppliers of inventory to leverage VF's credit rating to receive payment from participating financial institutions prior to the payment date specified in the terms between VF and the supplier. The SCF program is administered through third-party platforms that allow participating suppliers to track payments from VF and elect which VF receivables, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. The transactions are at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions, and VF is not a party to the agreements and has no economic interest in the supplier's decision to sell a receivable. The terms between VF and the supplier, including the amount due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by a supplier's participation in the SCF program. Amounts due to suppliers who voluntarily participate in the SCF program are included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets and VF payments made under the SCF program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in VF's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. VF has been informed by the participating financial institutions that amounts payable to them for suppliers who voluntarily participated in the SCF program and included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheet was $ 159.9  million at December 2022.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, January 2021 and December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2020-04, " Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ",
ASU No. 2021-01,
" Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope "
and
ASU No. 2022-06, " Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 ",
respectively.
This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The optional guidance is provided to ease the potential
burden of accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance is effective and can be adopted no later than December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on VF's consolidated financial statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10,
"Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance" ,
an update that requires
annual disclosures about government assistance, including the types of assistance and the effect on the financial statements. The guidance is effective for VF in Fiscal 2023, but the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's annual disclosures. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, " Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations".
This guidance requires companies with supplier finance programs to disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative information about the program to allow a user of the financial statements to understand the nature of, activity in, and potential magnitude of the program. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, except for certain quantitative disclosures that will be effective in Fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF's disclosures. NOTE 3 —

(a) $ 1,273   $ 1,065   $ 1,425   Contract liabilities
(b) 80,456   71,067   73,890   (a) Included in the other current assets line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (b) Included in the accrued liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended December 2022, the Company recognized $ 79.2  million and $ 239.8
million, respectively, of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance during the period, including amounts recorded as a contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue as performance obligations were satisfied within the same period, such as order deposits from customers. The change in the contract asset and contract liability balances primarily results from the timing differences between the Company's satisfaction of performance obligations and the customer's payment. Performance Obligations As of December 2022, the Company expects to recognize
$ 73.9
million of fixed consideration related to the future mini mum guarantees in effect under its licensing agreements and expects such amounts to be recognized over time based on the
contractual terms through March 2031. The variable consideration related to licensing arrangements is not disclosed as a remaining performance obligation as it qualifies for the sales-based royalty exemption. VF has also elected the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. As of December 2022, there were no arrang ements with transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations other than contracts for which the Company has applied the practical expedients and the fixed consideration related to future minimum guarantees discussed above. For the three and nine months ended December 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods was not material.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Incentive Equity Awards Granted During the nine months ended December 2022, VF granted stock options to employees and nonemployee members of VF's Board of Directors to purchase
2,472,423
shares of its Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $ 45.15
per share. The exercise price of each option granted was equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over
three years . Stock options granted to nonemployee members of VF's Board of Directors vest upon grant and become exercisable
one year
from the date of grant. All options have
ten-year
terms.
The grant date fair value of each option award was calculated using a lattice option-pricing valuation model, which incorporated a range of assumptions for inputs as follows:   Nine Months Ended December 2022 Expected volatility 30 % to  45 % Weighted average expected volatility 39 % Expected term (in years) 6.0  to  7.8 Weighted average dividend yield 2.9 % Risk-free interest rate 1.53 % to
4.75 % Weighted average fair value at date of grant $ 13.48 During the nine months ended December 2022, VF granted
364,192
performance-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees that enable them to receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a
three-year
performance cycle. The weighted average fair market value of VF Common Stock at the dates the units were granted was $ 45.23
per share. Each performance-based RSU has a potential final payout ranging from
zero
to
two
shares of VF Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of
three-year
financial targets set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares will be issued to participants in the year following the conclusion of the
three-year
performance period. The financial targets include
50 %
weighting based on VF's revenue growth and
50 % weighting based on VF's gross margin performance over the
three-year
period compared to financial targets. Additionally, the actual number of shares earned may be adjusted upward or downward by
25 % of the target award, based on how VF's total shareholder return ("TSR") over the
three-year
period compares to the TSR for companies included in the Standard & Poor's 500 Consumer Discretionary Index. The grant date fair value of the TSR-based adjustment related to the performance-based RSU grants was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates option-pricing model inputs, and was $ 3.46
per share. 19
VF Corporation Q3 FY23 Form 10-Q Table

from the date of grant. The weighted average fair market value of VF Common Stock at the dates the units were granted was $ 45.29
per share. In addition, VF granted
933,767
nonperformance-based RSUs to employees during the nine months ended December 2022. These units generally vest over periods up to
four years
from the date of grant and each unit entitles the holder to
one
share of VF
Common Stock. The weighted average fair market value of VF Common Stock at the dates the units were granted was $ 40.08
per share. VF also granted
125,981
restricted shares of VF Common Stock to members of management during the nine months ended December 2022. These shares vest over periods up to
four years
from the date of grant. The weighted average fair market value of VF Common Stock at the dates the shares were granted was $ 35.72

INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended December 2022 was ( 28.6 )% compared to
16.0 % in the 2021 period. The nine months ended December 2022 included a net discrete tax benefit of $ 98.8
million, which primarily related to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examinations for tax year 2017 and short-tax year 2018 resulting in a $ 94.9  million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the $ 98.8
million net discrete tax benefit in the 2022 period, the effective income tax rate would have been
9.5 %. The nine months ended December 2021 included a net discrete tax expense of $ 43.7
million, which included a $ 92.3
million net tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest, a $ 9.6
million net tax benefit related to return to accrual adjustments, a $ 35.2
million net tax benefit related to withholding taxes on prior foreign earnings, a $ 1.7
million tax benefit related to stock compensation, and a $ 2.4
million net tax benefit related to tax rate change on deferred tax items. Excluding the $ 43.7
million net discrete tax expense in the 2021 period, the effective income tax rate would have been
12.8 %. Without discrete items, the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended December 2022 decreased by
3.3 % compared with the 2021 period primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous state and international jurisdictions. In the U.S., the IRS examinations for tax years throug h 2015
have been effectively settled. As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the “Court”) to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF’s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue. On January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $ 875.7  million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable and is included in the other assets line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 2022, based on our assessment of the position under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. Refer to Note 19 for additional details on this matter. In addition, VF is currently subject to examination by various state and international tax authorities. Management regularly assesses the potential outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current and prior years and has concluded that VF’s provision for income taxes is adequate. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations will conclude during the next 12 months.
VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. During 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) investigated and announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered the tax benefits to be collected from affected companies, including VF. Requests for annulment were filed by Belgium and VF Europe BVBA individually. During 2017 and 2018, VF Europe BVBA was assessed and paid € 35.0
million tax and interest, which was recorded as an income tax receivable and is included in the other current assets line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the expected success of the requests for annulment. During 2019, the General Court annulled the EU decision and the EU subsequently appealed the General Court’s annulment. In September 2021, the General Court's judgment was set aside by the Court of Justice of the EU and the case was sent back to the General Court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal State aid. The case remains open and unresolved. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF. During the nine months ended December 2022, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest increased by $ 9.9
million to $ 287.7
million. Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits and interest may decrease during the next 12 months by approximately $ 271.4
million related to the completion of examinations and other settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations, of which $ 24.9
million would reduce income tax expense. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on the current analysis of the provisions, the Company does not expect this legislation to have a material impact on VF's income tax accounts.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation process. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is based on the observability and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows: • Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 — Significant directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant indirectly observable
data through corroboration with observable market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or (iii) information derived from or corroborated by observable market data. • Level 3 — Prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data inputs. These inputs would normally be VF’s own data and judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis:   Total Fair Value Fair Value Measurement Using

of Con tents The following table presents the activity related to the contingent consideration liability designated as Level 3: Three Months Ended December Nine Months Ended December (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Beginning Balance $ —   $ 99,000   $ 56,976   $ 207,000   Change in fair value —   ( 50,000 ) —   ( 158,000 ) Cash payout —   —   ( 56,976 ) —   Ending Balance $ —   $ 49,000   $ —   $ 49,000   VF’s cash equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with maturities within three months of their purchase dates that approximate fair value based on Level 1 measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts, is determined based on observable market inputs (Level 2), including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign currencies, and considers the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. VF’s deferred compensation assets primarily represent investments held within plan trusts as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities. These investments primarily include mutual funds (Level 1) that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets. Liabilities related to VF’s deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of the participants’ selection of hypothetical investments. The contingent consideration liability represented the amount of additional cash consideration paid to the selling shareholders of Supreme Holdings, Inc. ("Supreme"), which was dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets over the
one-year
earn-out period ended January 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability, which could range from
zero
to $ 300.0  million, was $ 57.0  million as of March 2022 and was paid during the nine months ended December 2022. During Fiscal 2022, the contingent consideration liability was remeasured at fair value based on the probability-weighted present value of various future cash payment outcomes resulting from the estimated achievement levels of the financial targets, with changes recognized in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All other significant financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost, except life insurance contracts which are recorded at cash surrender value. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At December 2022 and March 2022, their carrying values approximated fair value. Additionally, at December 2022 and March 2022, the carrying values of VF’s long-term debt, including the current portion, were $ 5,528.1
million and $ 5,085.3
million, respectively, compared with fair values of $ 5,079.0
million and $ 5,042.5
million at those respective dates. Fair value for long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Certain non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value.
However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to its estimate fair value, using market-based assumptions. In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-live intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, management performed quantitative impairment analysis of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the quantitative impairment analysis, management concluded the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were
not
impaired. The estimated fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite lived trademark intangible asset exceeded the carrying values by
5 % and
3 %, respectively.
The Company has continued to monitor macroeconomic events after its most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing. Due to continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred requiring impairment testing of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. Supreme was acquired by VF in Fiscal 2021. Supreme is a global streetwear leader that sells apparel, accessories and footwear under its namesake brand,
Supreme ® . Products are sold globally through VF-operated stores and online. The Supreme reporting unit is included in the Active reportable segment. The carrying values of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the October 1, 2022 testing date were $ 1.21  billion and $ 1.19  billion, respectively. The fair values of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were estimated using valuation techniques consistent with those discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, and utilized significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). As a result of the interim impairment testing performed, VF recorded impairment charges of $ 229.0
million and $ 192.9
million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and
indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended December 2022. The impairment related to an increase in the market-based discount rates used in the valuations and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on financial projections. Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered recent and historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the
23
VF Corporation Q3 FY23 Form 10-Q Table
of Con tents valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business. Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset include: • Financial projections and future cash flows reflecting results lower than forecasts used in the Fiscal 2022 annual test primarily driven by the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes. The projections assume revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period reflecting the long-term strategy for the business which is largely unchanged from the business combination valuation, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business; • Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled, which consider intellectual property transfers completed by the Company during Fiscal 2022; • Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements with similar VF brands, which are consistent with the Fiscal 2022 annual test valuation assumptions; • Market-based discount rates above those used in the Fiscal 2022 annual test valuation primarily driven by a higher federal funds rate; and, • Market approach reflecting lower recent historical financial measures for Supreme and valuation multiples below those used in the Fiscal 2022 annual test. The valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes revenue growth and profitability improvement, and execution of Supreme's long-term growth strategy,
including expansion into new markets. Management's estimates were based on information available as of the date of our assessment. Although management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment testing are reasonable and appropriate, it is possible that VF's assumptions and conclusions regarding impairment of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset could change in future periods. There can be no assurance the estimates and assumptions, particularly our long-term financial projections, used in the impairment testing during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, variations in our assumptions related to brand performance and execution of planned growth strategies, foreign currency exchange rates, discount rates, or comparable company market approach inputs could impact future conclusions. A future impairment charge of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset could have a material effect on VF's consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company owns a broad, diverse portfolio of brands and businesses for which material amounts of goodwill and intangible assets have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management continuously evaluates the performance of VF's brands and businesses, as well as other relevant factors, in assessing whether potential triggering events have occurred. Although no other triggering events for impairment testing were identified during the three or nine months ended December 2022, it is possible that VF's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets could change in future periods. A future impairment charge of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VF's consolidated financial position and results of operations. VF will perform its required annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023. NOTE 17 —
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Summary of Derivative Financial Instruments VF’s outstanding derivative financial instruments include foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. Although derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship, a limited number of derivative contracts intended to hedge assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
The notional amounts of all outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts were $ 3.3
billion at December 2022, $ 2.9
billion
at March 2022 and $ 2.8
billion at December 2021, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro,
British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Mexican peso, South Korean won, Swedish krona, Polish zloty, Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar. These derivative contracts have maturities up to
20
months. In the three months ended December 2022, VF entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the cash flow risk of interest payments on its variable-rate DDTL Agreement. The notional amount of VF's outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $ 500.0
million at December 2022. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the debt agreement.

These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in earnings. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net transaction losses or gains on the related assets and liabilities. In the case of derivative contracts executed on foreign currency exposures that are no longer probable of occurring, VF de-designates these hedges and the fair value changes of these instruments are also recognized directly in earnings. The impact of de-designated derivative contracts and changes in the fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedges, recognized as gains or losses in VF's Consolidated Statements of Operations wer e not material f or the three and nine months ended December 2022 and December 2021. Other Derivative Information At December 2022, accumulated O CI included $ 101.1
million of pre-tax net deferred gains for foreign currency exchange contracts that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. The amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative contracts are settled. Net Investment Hedge The Company has designated its euro-denominated fixed-rate notes, which represent € 1.850
billion in aggregate principal, as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. During the three and nine-month periods ended December 2022, the Company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 126.5
million and an after-tax gain of $ 45.2
million, respectively, in OCI related to the net investment hedge transaction, and an after-tax gain of $ 29.1
million and $ 51.7
million for the three and nine-month periods ended December 2021, respectively. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

RESTRUCTURING
The Company incurs restructuring charges related to strategic initiatives and cost optimization of business activities, primarily related to severance and employee-related benefits. During the three and nine months ended December 2022, VF recognized $ 11.1  million and $ 63.0
million, respectively, of restructuring charges, related to approved initiatives. Of the restructuring charges recognized in the three and nine months ended December 2022, $ 10.4  million and $ 58.9
million were reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and $ 0.7  million
and $ 4.1
million in cost of goods sold, respectively. The Company has not recognized any significant incremental costs related to accruals for the year ended March 2022 or prior periods. Of the $ 48.9  million total restructuring accrual at December 2022, $ 45.8
million is expected to be paid out within the next 12 months and is classified within accrued liabilities. The remaining $ 3.1
million will be paid out beyond the next 12 months and thus is classified within other liabilities.

CONTINGENCIES
As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the “Court”) to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF’s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue. On January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $ 875.7
million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case and will accrue interest income. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending
its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this income tax receivable will not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF’s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense is estimated to be up to $ 730.0
million, plus the reversal of any interest income accrued on the payment. The Company is currently involved in other legal proceedings that are ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the business. The resolution of which is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 20 —
SUBSEQUENT EVENT

of Con tents ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the “Company”) uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. The Company's current fiscal year runs from April 3, 2022 through April 1, 2023 ("Fiscal 2023"). Accordingly, this Form 10-Q presents our third quarter of Fiscal 2023. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended December 2022 and December 2021 relate to the fiscal periods ended on December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. References to March 2022 relate to information as of April 2, 2022. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and all percentages shown in the tables below and the following discussion have been calculated using unrounded numbers.
References to the three and nine months ended December 2022 foreign currency amounts and impacts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the three and nine months ended December 2021 when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. VF’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in euro-based countries. Additionally, VF conducts business in other developed and emerging markets
around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro. On June 28, 2021, VF completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business was comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses:
Red Kap ® ,
VF Solutions ® ,
Bulwark ® ,
Workrite ® ,
Walls ® ,
Terra ® ,
Kodiak ® ,
Work Authority ®
and
Horace Small ® . The business also included the license of certain
Dickies ®
occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. The results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, through the date of sale. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to VF’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, amounts, percentages and discussion for all periods included below reflect the results of operations and financial condition from VF’s continuing operations.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Executive Leadership Transition On December 2, 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Benno Dorer, a member of the Board, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately. In addition, Richard Carucci, a member of the Board, was appointed as Interim Chairman of the Board on the same date. Mr. Dorer and Mr. Carucci succeed Steve Rendle, who, by mutual agreement with the Board, retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of the Board on the same date.
Dividend Update On February 2, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share that is payable during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, which represents a 41% reduction when compared to the dividend of $0.51 per share paid in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The decrease in the dividend is an action taken to strengthen the Company's financial position, accelerate the return to target leverage ratios and provide additional financial flexibility to navigate the current macroeconomic challenges and maintain investments to advance its greatest value creation opportunities. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends. Macroeconomic Environment The macroeconomic environment continues to dynamically evolve. Global trends, including inflationary pressures, are weakening consumer sentiment, negatively impacting consumer spending behavior and creating variable traffic patterns across channels. These conditions are leading to elevated inventories in certain markets and an increased promotional environment. Additionally, the strong U.S. dollar has resulted in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes, which have significantly impacted the results of our international businesses. The Company is also operating in a higher interest
rate environment, resulting in increased borrowing costs. There is ongoing uncertainty around the global economy and macroeconomic environment, which we expect to continue and cause disruption and near-term challenges for our business.
Russia-Ukraine Conflict In response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, all VF-operated retail locations within Russia are permanently closed. Limited wholesale shipments to both Russia and Ukraine have resumed. Revenues in Russia and Ukraine represented less than 1% of VF's total Fiscal 2022 revenue. While we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the conflict, we currently do not expect significant disruption to our business.
For additional information, see the risk factors discussed in
Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Fiscal
2022
Form 10-K. Impact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Update The coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic significantly impacted global economic conditions, as well as VF's business operations and financial performance during Fiscal 2022 and continues to impact Fiscal 2023.
VF-operated retail stores across the globe have been impacted due to COVID-19, including temporary closures for varying periods. In Fiscal 2023, the impacts have been most notable in the Asia-Pacific region, including Mainland China. VF is continuing to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak globally and will comply with guidance from government entities and public health authorities to prioritize the health and well-being of its employees, customers, trade partners and consumers. As COVID-19 uncertainty continues, retail store closures may recur. COVID-19 has also impacted some of VF's suppliers, including raw material suppliers, third-party manufacturers, logistics providers and other vendors. At this time, the majority of VF's supply chain is operational. Suppliers are complying with local
29
VF Corporation Q3 FY23 Form 10-Q Table
of Con tents health advisories and governmental restrictions which has resulted in product delays. The resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries resulted in additional manufacturing capacity constraints and logistical challenges during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023. VF has worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption and employed expedited freight as needed. Although the situation has improved over time, during the high-volume third quarter lead times across the supply chain coupled with higher volatility on the distribution and logistics network, particularly in the Americas, and event-driven spikes in demand, led to inconsistent on-time delivery performance and higher cancellations with our wholesale partners and inefficiencies in support of our direct-to-consumer business. VF's distribution centers are operational in accordance with local government guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, and has driven global uncertainty and disruption. While we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect ongoing disruption to our business.

Form 10-K. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 • Revenues were down 3% to $3.5 billion compared to the three months ended December 2021, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. • Outdoor segment revenues increased 4% to $2.0 billion compared to the three months ended December 2021, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. • Active segment revenues decreased 11% to $1.3 billion compared to the three months ended December 2021, including a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. • Work segment revenues decreased 6% to $268.9 million compared to the three months ended December 2021, including a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. • Direct-to-consumer revenues were down 2% over the 2021 period, including a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. E-commerce revenues were flat in the current period, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Direct-to-consumer revenues accounted for 55% of VF's net revenues for the three months ended December 2022. • International revenues decreased 3% compared to the three months ended December 2021, including an 11% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Greater China (which includes Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) revenues decreased 11%, including a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. International revenues represented 46% of VF's net revenues for the three months ended December 2022. • Gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 54.9% compared to the three months ended December 2021, primarily driven by higher promotional activity, partially offset by price increases. • Earnings per share was $1.31 compared to $1.32 in the 2021 period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower profitability in the Active segment for the three months ended December 2022, which was offset by a $0.24 discrete tax benefit in the quarter. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Statements of Operations The following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues for the three and nine months ended December 2022 from the comparable period in 2021: (In millions) Three Months Ended December Nine Months Ended December Net revenues — 2021 $ 3,624.4   $ 9,017.2   Organic 93.5  333.7  Impact of foreign currency (187.2) (478.0) Net revenues — 2022 $ 3,530.7   $ 8,872.9   VF reported a 3% and 2% decrease in revenues for the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods. The revenue decrease in both periods was primarily driven by declines in the Active segment and a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency in both the three and nine months ended December 2022. Revenues in the Active segment during the three and nine months ended December 2022 were impacted by weakness in the Americas region, primarily driven by declines in the
Vans ®
brand. Revenues in the Active segment during the three and nine months ended
December 2022 were also impacted by declines in the Asia-Pacific region, which has been negatively impacted by COVID-19 resurgence that has caused disruption and consumption pressure in the region, particularly in Mainland China. The decrease in both periods was partially offset by global growth in the Outdoor segment. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Reportable Segment.”

30 Table
of Con tents The following table presents the percentage relationships to net revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Operations:   Three Months Ended December Nine Months Ended December   2022 2021 2022 2021 Gross margin (net revenues less cost of goods sold) 54.9  % 56.1  % 53.4  % 55.3  % Selling, general and administrative expenses 40.3  37.4  43.1  39.3  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets —  —  4.8  —  Operating margin 14.6   % 18.7   % 5.5   % 16.0   % Gross margin decreased 120 and 190 basis points in the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods. The decreases were
primarily driven by increased discounts and other promotional activity and higher material costs, partially offset by price increases. The decrease in the three months ended December 2022 was also partially offset by lower freight costs and favorable channel mix in the Outdoor and Work segments. The decrease in the nine months ended December 2022 was also partially attributed to unfavorable channel mix driven by the Active segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 290 and 380 basis points during the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68.2 million and $278.4 million in the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods, including $50.0 million and $158.0 million decreases in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition, which were recognized in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the three and nine months ended December 2021, respectively. The increase was also due to higher advertising costs and higher corporate restructuring charges in the three and nine months ended December 2022. The increase in the nine months ended December 2022 was also due to higher investments in information technology. VF recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $229.0 million and $192.9 million, respectively, in the
nine
months ended
December 2022
related to the Supreme reporting unit.
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, due to continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred requiring impairment testing of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset.
The impairment related to an increase in the market-based discount rates used in the valuations and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on financial projections. Net interest expen se increased $16.8 million and $14.9 million during the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods. The increase in net interest expense in both the three and nine months ended December 2022 was primarily due to higher short-term commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the delayed draw Term Loan Agreement (the "DDTL Agreement") and an increase in borrowing rates. The increase was partially offset by repayment of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal of the 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022. Total outstanding debt averaged $6.5 billion in the nine months ended December 2022 and $5.7 billion in the same period in 2021, with weighted average
interest rates of 2.3% and 2.1% in the nine months ended December 2022 and 2021, respectively. Loss on debt extinguishment of $3.6 million was recorded in the three and nine months ended December 2021, as a result of the early redemption of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of VF's outstanding 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022. Other income (expense), net decreased $9.8 million and $130.4 million during the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, compared to the 2021 periods. The decrease in the three months ended December 2022 was primarily driven by higher foreign currency losses. The decrease in the nine months ended December 2022 was primarily driven by lower net periodic pension income and higher foreign currency losses compared to the 2021 periods. The decrease in the nine months ended December 2022 included a
$91.8 million
pension settlement charge, which resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract and transfer of a portion of the assets and liabilities associated with the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to an insurance company. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended December 2022 was (28.6)% compared to 16.0% in the 2021 period. The nine months ended December 2022 included a net discrete tax benefit of $98.8 million, which primarily related to the IRS examinations for tax year 2017 and short-tax year 2018 resulting in a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the $98.8 million net discrete tax benefit in the 2022 period, the effective income tax rate would have been 9.5%. The nine months ended December 2021 included a net discrete tax expense of $43.7 million, which included a $92.3 million net tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest, a $9.6 million net tax benefit related to return to accrual adjustments, a $35.2 million net tax benefit related to withholding taxes on prior foreign earnings, a $1.7 million tax benefit related to stock compensation, and a $2.4 million net tax benefit related to tax rate change on deferred tax items. Excluding the $43.7 million net discrete tax expense in the 2021 period, the effective income tax rate would have been 12.8%. Without discrete items, the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended December 2022 decreased by 3.3% compared with the 2021 period primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in the three months ended December 2022 was $507.9 million ($1.31 per diluted share) compared to $517.8 million ($1.32 per diluted share) in the 2021 period, and income from continuing operations in the nine months ended December 2022 was $333.5 million ($0.86 per diluted share) compared to $1.1 billion ($2.89 per diluted share) in the 2021 period.

pension settlement charge recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023.
Additionally, the increase in the three and nine months ended December 2022 when compared to the 2021 periods was driven by a $50.0 million and $158.0 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition in the three and nine months ended December 2021, respectively.

of Con tents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Consolidated Balance Sheets The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at December 2022 compared to March 2022: • Increase in inventories
— driven by increased in-transit inventory of $441.6 million resulting from the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination, with the remaining increase resulting primarily from higher cancellations and softening consumer demand along with the impact of COVID-19 related challenges in the supply chain where prolonged manufacturing and logistics lead times forced earlier buy commitments and led to higher excess inventory being generated. • Increase in other current assets
— primarily due to assets classified as held-for-sale at December 2022, the majority of which relates to a sale-leaseback transaction for an office location in the Europe region. • Decrease in intangible assets
— primarily due to a $192.9 million impairment charge related to the
Supreme ®
indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset recorded in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023.
• Decrease in goodwill
— primarily due to a $229.0 million impairment charge related to the Supreme reporting unit recorded in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. • Increase in other assets
— primarily due to an $875.7 million payment related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed in The Timberland Company court case, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case. • Increase in short-term borrowings
— primarily due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings to support working capital requirements. • Increase in the current portion of long-term debt
— due to the reclassification of €850.0 million ($909.7 million) of long-term notes due in September 2023, partially offset by the repayment of $500.0 million of long-term notes in April 2022. • Increase in accounts payable
— primarily due to the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination. • Decrease in other liabilities
— primarily due to a discrete tax benefit resulting in a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at December 2022 compared to December 2021: • Increase in inventories

— primarily due to the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination. • Decrease in accrued liabilities
—
primarily due to lower accrued income taxes, the payout of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition and lower accrued compensation. • Decrease in other liabilities
— primarily due to a discrete tax benefit resulting in a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

of Con tents Liquidity and Capital Resources We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: December March December (Dollars in millions) 2022 2022 2021 Working capital $697.7 $1,272.7 $1,376.8 Current ratio 1.2 to 1 1.4 to 1 1.4 to 1 Net debt to total capital 68.7% 61.0% 59.4% The decrease in working capital and the current ratio at December 2022 compared to both March 2022 and December 2021 was primarily due to a net increase in current liabilities driven by higher short-term borrowings, a higher current portion of long-term debt and higher accounts payable, partially offset by a net increase in current assets driven by higher inventories for the periods compared as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheets" section above. For the ratio of net debt to total capital, net debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, in addition to operating lease liabilities, net of unrestricted cash. Total capital is defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity. The increase in the net debt to total capital ratio at December 2022 compared to both March 2022 and December 2021 was primaril y driven by an increase in net debt to support working capital demands
at December 2022 and a decrease in stockholders' equity for the periods compared. The increase in net debt was primarily attributed to the increase in short-term borrowings, as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheet" section above. The increase in net debt at December 2022 compared to both
March 2022 and December 2021 was also due to borrowings of $1.0 billion under the DDTL Agreement in the three months ended December 2022, partially offset by the repayment of $500.0 million of long-term notes in April 2022. The decrease in stockholders' equity at December 2022 compared to both March 2022 and December 2021 was primarily driven by payments of dividends, partially offset by net income in the respective periods. VF’s primary source of liquidity is its expected annual cash flow from operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. VF's additional sources of liquidity include available borrowing capacity against its Global Credit Facility, available cash balances and international lines of credit. In summary, our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows:   Nine Months Ended December (In thousands) 2022 2021 Cash provided (used) by operating activities $ (833,472) $ 791,290  Cash provided (used) by investing activities (206,833) 953,936  Cash provided (used) by financing activities 418,719  (1,257,664) Cash Provided (Used ) by Operating Activities Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended December 2022 compared to December 2021 was primarily due to an increase in net cash used by working capital a nd lower ear nings for the periods compared. The increase in cash used by working capital was primarily driven by higher inventory balances and the $875.7 million payment related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed in The Timberland Company court case. Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities The decrease in cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended December 2022 was primarily due to $616.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Occupational Workwear business and $598.8 million of proceeds from sale of short-term investments in the nine months ended December 2021. Capital expenditures decreased $84.0 million and software purchases increased $11.7 million in the nine months ended December 2022 compared to the 2021 period. The decrease in
capital expenditures was primarily driven by higher spending in the prior year related to a new distribution center in the Americas region.
Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended December 2022 was primarily due to borrowings of $1.0 billion under the DDTL Agreement, a net increase in short-term borrowings of $471.2 million and a $300.0 million decrease in share repurchases for the periods compared, which were partially offset by the $57.0 million payment of Supreme contingent consideration and a $35.5 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock for the periods compared. Share Repurchases VF did not purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market during the nine months ended December 2022. During the nine months ended December 2021, VF purchased 4.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $300.0 million (average price per share of $74.45)

Revolving Credit Facility and Short-term Borrowings VF relies on its ability to generate cash flows to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) that expires November 2026. VF may request an unlimited number of one-year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in U.S. dollars or any alternative currency (including euros and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. dollars, approved at the request of the Company by the lenders) and has a $75.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Outstanding short-term balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements. VF has restrictive covenants on its Global Credit Facility, including a consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated net capitalization financial ratio covenant starting at 70% with future step downs. The calculation of consolidated net indebtedness is net of unrestricted cash. The covenant calculation excludes consolidated operating lease liabilities. As of December 2022, VF was in compliance with all covenants. VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings of up to
$2.25 billion
to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. There
wer e $889.9 million in commercial paper borrowings as of December 2022 .
Standby letters of credit issued as of December 2022 were $24.7 million, leaving approximately $1.3 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at December 2022. Additionally, VF had $571.3 million of cash and equivalents at December 2022. VF ha s
$97.6 million of
international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $11.8 million at December 2022. Maturity On April 25, 2022, VF repaid the remaining $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022, in accordance with the terms of the notes. Term Debt Facility On August 11, 2022, the Company entered into a DDTL Agreement. Under the DDTL Agreement, the lenders agreed to provide up to three separate delayed draw term loans (each, a “Delayed Draw”) to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion (which may be increased to
$1.1 billion subject to the terms and conditions of the DDTL Agreement). The DDTL Agreement has a stated termination date of December 14, 2024. Subject to the terms and conditions of the DDTL Agreement, the Company may request extensions of the termination date. During the three months ended December 2022 ,
VF completed two draws under the DDTL Agreement totaling $1.0 billion, all of which will mature on December 14, 2024.
Supply Chain Financing Program During the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF reinstated its voluntary supply chain finance ("SCF") program. The SCF program enables a significant portion of our suppliers of inventory to leverage VF's credit rating to receive payment from participating financial institutions prior to the payment date specified in the terms between VF and the supplier. The SCF program is administered through third-party platforms that allow participating suppliers to track payments from VF and elect which VF receivables, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. The transactions are at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions, and VF is not a party to the agreements and has no economic interest in the supplier's decision to sell a receivable. The terms between VF and the supplier, including the amount due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by a supplier's participation in the SCF program. Amounts due to suppliers who voluntarily participate in the SCF program are included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets and VF payments made under the SCF program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in VF's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. VF has been informed by the participating financial institutions that amounts payable to them for suppliers who voluntarily participated in the SCF program and included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheet was $159.9 million at December 2022. The amounts settled through the SCF program during the three and nine months ended December 2022 were $333.8 million and $766.0 million, respectively. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF extended its payment terms with eligible suppliers under the SCF program. The extended payment terms are expected to have a positive impact on Fiscal 2023 cash flows from operating activities; however, the change is not expected to have a material impact on VF's long-term overall liquidity or capital resources. Rating Agencies VF’s credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of December 2022, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘BBB+’ by Standard & Poor’s ("S&P") Global Ratings and ‘Baa1’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-2’ and ‘P-2’, respectively. VF's credit rating outlook by both S&P and Moody's at the end of December 2022 was 'negative'.
None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF, and as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if required by the respective holders of the notes. The change of control provision applies to all notes, except for the notes due in 2033.

of Con tents Dividends The Company paid cash dividends of $0.51 per share and $1.51 per share during the three and nine months ended December 2022, respectively, and the Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share that is payable in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends. Contractual Obligations Management’s Discussion and Analysis in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K provided a table summarizing VF’s material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of Fiscal 2022 that would require the use of funds. As of December 2022, there have been no material changes in the amounts of unrecorded commitments disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, except as noted below: • Inventory purchase obligations decreased by approximately $800.0 million at the end of
December 2022
primarily due
to changes in terms with suppliers that increased in-transit inventory and the timing of fulfilled orders following periods of supply chain disruption. As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the “Court”) to resolve an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF’s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for
summary judgment on the issue. On January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $875.7 million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case and will accrue interest income. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this income tax receivable will not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF’s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense is estimated to be up to $730.0 million, plus the reversal of any interest income accrued on the payment.
There continues to be uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 pandemic. However, management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during and after the disruptions caused by the challenging macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 pandemic, and meet its current and long-term obligations as they become due. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to VF’s consolidated financial statements for information on recently issued accounting standards.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management has chosen accounting policies it considers to be appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our critical accounting policies are applied in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K.
The application of these accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions, and may retain outside consultants to assist in the evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous
estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The accounting policies that involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K.
Except as disclosed in Note 1 to VF's consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in VF's accounting policies from those disclosed in our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 16 for additional detail of critical accounting estimates during the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, which were associated with impairment testing of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements From time to time, VF may make oral or written statements, including statements in this quarterly report, that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VF’s
operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees,
41
VF Corporation Q3 FY23 Form 10-Q Table
of Con tents and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: risks arising from the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic; the level of consumer demand for apparel, footwear and accessories; disruption to VF’s distribution system; changes in global economic conditions and the financial strength of VF’s customers, including as a result of current inflationary pressures; fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and contracted products; disruption and volatility in the global capital and credit markets; VF’s response to changing fashion trends, evolving consumer preferences and changing patterns of consumer behavior; intense competition from online retailers and other direct-to-consumer business risks; third-party manufacturing and product innovation; increasing pressure on margins; VF’s ability to implement its business strategy; VF’s ability to grow its international, direct-to-consumer and digital businesses; VF's ability to transform its model to be more consumer-minded, retail-centric and hyper-digital; retail industry changes and challenges; VF's ability to create and maintain an agile and efficient operating model and organizational structure; VF’s and its vendors’ ability to maintain the strength and security of information technology systems; the risk that VF’s facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate or detect data or information security breaches and data or financial loss; VF’s ability to properly collect, use, manage and secure business,
consumer and employee data and comply with privacy and security regulations; foreign currency fluctuations; stability of VF's vendors' manufacturing facilities and VF's ability to establish and maintain effective supply chain capabilities; continued use by VF’s suppliers of ethical business practices; VF’s ability to accurately forecast demand for products; continuity of members of VF’s management; VF's ability to recruit, develop or retain qualified employees; VF’s ability to protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights; possible goodwill and other asset impairment such as the recent impairment charges related to the
Supreme ®
reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset; maintenance by VF’s licensees and distributors of the value of VF’s brands; VF’s ability to execute acquisitions and dispositions and integrate acquisitions; business resiliency in response to natural or man-made economic, political or environmental disruptions; changes in tax laws and additional tax liabilities, including the timing of income inclusion associated with our acquisition of the
Timberland ®
brand in 2011; legal, regulatory, political, economic, and geopolitical risks, including those related to the current conflict in Ukraine; changes to laws and regulations; adverse or unexpected weather conditions; VF's indebtedness and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, if needed, could prevent VF from fulfilling its financial obligations; VF's ability to pay and declare dividends or repurchase its stock in the future; climate change and increased focus on environmental, social and governance issues; and tax risks associated with the spin-off of our Jeanswear business completed in 2019. More information on potential factors that could affect VF’s financial results is included from time to time in VF’s public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including VF’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 3 — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. There have been no significant changes in VF’s market risk exposures from what was disclosed in Item 7A in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure controls and procedures: Under the supervision of the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a Disclosure Committee comprising various members of management has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures at VF and its subsidiaries as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of the Evaluation Date that such controls and procedures were effective. Changes in internal control over financial reporting: There have been no changes during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, VF's internal control over financial reporting. PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. See Note 19 - Contingencies within Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion regarding pending material legal proceedings. Except as otherwise noted, there have been no material developments in such legal proceedings. For previously reported information about material legal proceedings, refer to Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings,” of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental regulations if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, VF uses a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. VF believes that this threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceedings that are material to VF’s business or financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no such proceedings to disclose for this period.

of Con tents ITEM 1A — RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Fiscal
2022
Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in the Fiscal
2022
Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Other than the risks identified below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Fiscal
2022
Form 10-K. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS There are risks associated with VF’s acquisitions and portfolio management. Any acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions. Moreover, failure to effectively manage VF’s portfolio of brands in line with growth targets and shareholder expectations, including acquisition choices, integration approach and divestiture timing could result in unfavorable impacts to growth and value creation. Our acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges, such as the recent impairment charges related to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset (see Note 16 within Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material. Talent management, employee retention and experience are important factors in VF’s success. Turnover in VF’s leadership or other key positions may have a material adverse effect on VF. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience and maintain a culture of wellbeing, empowerment and diversity and inclusion to ensure VF is innovative and remains competitive in a rapidly-changing global marketplace. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, developing, and retaining such personnel, which could impact VF’s ability to remain competitive. Additionally, changes to our office environments, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often
certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As businesses increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives, our relationships with our customers or other third parties may be disrupted, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in VF’s business, and in developing and retaining employees. This loss of experience and expertise can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts. Attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on VF.
On December 2, 2022, VF’s Board of Directors appointed Benno Dorer, a member of the Board, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately following the retirement of Steve Rendle, VF’s then President and Chief Executive Officer. VF’s Board has retained a search firm to assist in identifying a permanent Chief Executive Officer. This recent change in our executive leadership team, along with other changes in the roles and responsibilities among our executive officers, and any future changes resulting from the hiring or departure of executive officers, could disrupt our business and negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain talent. Such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with our associates and other third parties. Further, this change also increases our dependency on other members of our executive leadership team who remain with us, and the departure of any remaining executive officer could be particularly disruptive in light of the recent leadership transitions. 43
VF Corporation Q3 FY23 Form 10-Q Table
of Con tents LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS We may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws. As a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of U.S. and international tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits and court proceedings. In particular, tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no- or low-tax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction. Tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries. For example, VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. During 2015, the EU investigated and announced its decision that the ruling was illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under the ruling should be collected from the affected companies, including VF Europe, BVBA, a subsidiary of VF. Requests for annulment were filed by Belgium and VF Europe BVBA, individually. During 2017 and 2018, VF Europe BVBA was assessed and paid €35.0 million in tax and interest, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the expected success of the requests for annulment. During 2019, the General Court annulled the EU decision and the EU subsequently appealed the General Court’s annulment. In September 2021, the General Court’s judgment was set aside by the Court of Justice of the EU and the case was sent back to the General Court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal State aid. The case remains open and unresolved. If this matter is adversely resolved, the tax and interest amounts paid by VF will not be collected by VF. Also, as previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the "Court") to resolve an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF's acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue, and on January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $875.7 million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as a tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case
and will accrue interest income . VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this tax receivable may not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF’s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense is estimated to be up to
$730.0 million, plus the reversal of any interest income accrued on the payment. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings, or court interpretations (involving VF or other companies with similar tax profiles) may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. FINANCIAL RISKS VF’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, such as the recent impairment charges related to the
Supreme ®
reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference. During the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2022, due to continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, VF determined that a triggering event had occurred requiring impairment testing of
the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset.
As a result of the impairment testing performed, VF recorded impairment charges of $229.0 million and $192.9 million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and
indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively. The impairment primarily related to an increase in the market-based discount rates used in the valuations and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on financial projections. It is possible that we could have another impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2023 or future years vary from our current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible
assets. Any future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible

of Con tents assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. VF’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent VF from fulfilling its financial obligations, and VF may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings, may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants. As of December 31, 2022, VF had approximately $6.4 billion of debt outstanding. VF’s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could: • require VF to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to repaying its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, dividends, repurchase VF’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes; • limit VF’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates; • place VF at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less indebtedness outstanding; and • negatively affect VF's credit ratings and limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in VF’s debt documents and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, VF may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes. If VF incurs
additional indebtedness, it may limit VF’s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs. Although VF has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs, any determinations by the Board of Directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on VF’s common stock or to repurchase VF’s common stock will be based primarily upon VF’s financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the Board of Directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of VF’s shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amount or at all. A reduction in the amount or suspension of our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level or discontinuation of our share repurchases could have a negative effect on VF’s stock price.
VF is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents. Failure by VF to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on VF if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable.
