SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 (In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
1.   Description of the business
Salona Global Medical Device Corporation (formerly known as Brattle Street Investment Corp.) ("the Company," "us," "our," "Salona," “Salona Global,” or the "Company"), is a publicly traded company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the "Exchange" or "TSXV"). The Company is an acquisition oriented, US-based and revenue generating medical device technology company. The Company aims to leverage the liquid Canadian capital markets to acquire small to midsize US and internationally based medical device products and companies with the goal of expanding sales and improving operations. The Company's aim is to create a large, broad-based medical device company with global reach.
The Company was incorporated under the
Canada Business Corporations Act
on September 17, 2013. The Company's common shares trade on the Exchange under the symbol "SGMD". The Company's registered office is Suite 200E - 1515A Bayview Avenue, East York, Ontario, Ontario, M4G 3B5.
On December 21, 2020, the Company consolidated its issued and outstanding common shares based on 7.37 post-consolidation common shares for 10 pre-consolidation common shares (the "Consolidation").
These shares were retroactively restated on the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
On May 21, 2021, the Company acquired South Dakota Partners Inc. ("SDP").
On September 30, 2021, the Company acquired Simbex, LLC ("Simbex").
On November 28, 2021, the Company launched a new U.S. sales subsidiary called ALG Health Plus, LLC ("Health Plus"), aimed at selling medical devices and supplies to small, independent hospitals and group purchasing organizations, organizations that offer small medical offices and clinics access to devices and supplies on a larger scale creating efficiencies by aggregating purchasing volumes.
On March 11, 2022, the Company acquired Mio-Guard, LLC ("Mio-Guard").
On September 23, 2022, the Company successfully closed its acquisition of DaMar Plastics Manufacturing Inc. ("DaMar"), a company focused on designing, producing and selling specialty plastics in several markets including the medical device market.
With over 50 years in business, DaMar currently serves the medical and consumer industries with precision plastic molding technology. The acquisition builds upon the Company's strategy to create a fully integrated global medical device company and adds precision plastics technology capabilities to the Company.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired DaMar through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Salona Global Buyer") in exchange for US$ 3.2
million in cash and
1,576,609
common shares of the Salona Global Buyer, plus a
contingent earn-out payment equal to 1.75 times EBITDA for the earn-out period , consisting of a combination of up to US$ 5.5
million in cash and up to
5,000,000
in shares of common stock of the Salona Global Buyer based on the performance of DaMar Plastics during the 12 month period ending February 28, 2024.
Pursuant to a Contribution and Exchange ‎Agreement, the sellers will be entitled ‎to exchange common shares of the Salona Global Buyer for Class "A" non-voting ‎common ‎shares of SGMD on a one-for-one basis‎‎.
On December 15, 2022, the Company announced its intention to focus on listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq") in 2023. As a first step, the Company has changed its fiscal year end to December 31, 2022, with the aim of preparing for a U.S. listing.

SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
The Company's operations could be significantly adversely affected by the effects of a widespread global outbreak of a contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. The Company cannot accurately predict the impact COVID-19 will have on its operations and the ability of others to meet their obligations with the Company, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and the length of travel and quarantine restrictions imposed by governments of affected countries. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could further affect the Company's operations and ability to finance its operations.
2.   Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company's financial position, the results of its operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, that the Company filed on May 31, 2022.
Functional and presentation currency
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. The functional currency of the Company is Canadian dollars, and the functional currency of its operating subsidiaries Inspira Financial Company, Simbex, LLC, ALG Health Plus, LLC, Mio-Guard, SDP, DaMar, and its holding company subsidiaries noted below is US dollars.
3.   Significant accounting policies
a)   Basis of consolidation
These statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, namely, Simbex, LLC ("Simbex"), ALG Health Plus, LLC ("Health Plus"), South Dakota Partners Inc. ("SDP"), Inspira Financial Company, Mio-Guard, LLC ("Mio-Guard"),  DaMar Plastics Manufacturing Inc. (“DaMar”),  and 1077863 B.C., Ltd, in the United States. Additionally, these statements consolidate the Company's wholly owned holding company subsidiaries, namely, Pan Novus Hospital Sales Group, LLC, Brattle Acquisition I Corp., Simbex Acquisition Parent I Corporation, Simbex Acquisition Parent Corporation, Mio-Tech Parent LLC, and DaMar Acquisition Corporation. The Company owns
100 % of all its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.

For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
b)   Basis of measurement
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on an historical cost basis except contingent consideration which are carried at fair value.
c)   Use of estimates
The preparation of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. This applies to useful lives of non-current assets, impairment of non-current assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, provisions for inventory and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d)   Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Company's other components. The segment operating results are reviewed regularly by the Company's CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. As of November 30, 2022, the Company has one segment, healthcare operations, which includes production, design, development, and sale of medical devices to businesses in the United States. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expense from this segment are disclosed in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
e)   Fair value of financial instruments
The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, security deposit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, line of credit, debt, contingent consideration payable, lease liabilities and other liabilities.

SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825,
Financial Instruments , defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures.
The carrying amounts reported in the interim unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization, low risk of counterparty default and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
Level 1 -
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 -
Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 -
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
Assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain assets or liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between the levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the years presented.
As of November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022, respectively, the Company did not identify any financial assets and liabilities other than contingent considerations resulting from the SDP, Simbex, ALG, DaMar, and Mio-Guard acquisitions, that would be required to be presented on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
f)   Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises goods and services provided to the Company's contracted customers and sales-based royalties charged by the Company to licensees of the Intellectual Property (IP) developed by the Company.
In accordance with ASC 606 -
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company accounts for a customer contract when the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance, collection of consideration is probable, and the contract has been signed and agreed to by both parties. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control or economic benefit of the service to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for its services. Revenue excludes sales tax and is recorded net of discounts and an allowance for estimated returns unless the terms of the sales are final.
10
SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
The principles in ASC 606 are applied using the following five steps:
1. Identify the contract with a customer;
2. Identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
3. Determine the transaction price;
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation(s) are satisfied.
SDP, Mio-Guard, DaMar, and Health Plus recognize revenue at a point-in-time upon transfer of control of goods to customers, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract, at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company received or expects to receive in exchange for the goods. Simbex recognizes its revenue over time as it meets its milestones and performs its obligations as agreed upon in its contracts with its customers. Payment received prior to the delivery of service is classified as deferred revenue.
For sales contracts with terms of more than one year, the Company recognizes any significant financing component as revenue over the contractual period using the effective interest method, and the associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations and included in other income.
Provisions for discounts, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. The Company has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.
The Company typically provides warranties for general repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale. These assurance-type warranties are accounted for as warranty provisions, if any.
g)   Research and development costs
Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred. These costs primarily consist of personnel and related expenses and are classified as part of the general and administrative expenses on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise highly liquid interest-bearing securities that are readily convertible to cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The maturities of these securities as at the purchase date are 90 days or less. A variable amount of the cash is held in cash backed, liquid US money market funds with high institutional credit ratings. Most of these money market funds are placed in United States dollar and securities issued by the United States Government.
i)   Inventories
Inventories are comprised of raw material, work-in-progress, trading goods, and finished goods, which consist principally of electrodes, electronic components, subassemblies, steel, hardware, and fasteners and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) and net realizable value and include direct labor, materials, and other related costs. The Company periodically reviews inventory for evidence of slow-moving or obsolete items, and writes inventory down to net realizable value, as needed.
11
SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
This write-down is based on management's review of inventories on hand, compared to estimated future usage and sales, shelf-life assumptions, and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional write-downs may be required. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not reversed subsequently to income, even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable.
j)   Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets acquired from the Company's business combinations. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-04
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350). Because an assembled workforce cannot be sold or transferred separately from the other assets in the business, any value attributed to it is subsumed into goodwill. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
When evaluating whether the goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company identifies the reporting unit on a basis that is similar to its method for identifying operating segments as defined by the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. This evaluation is applied annually on each impairment testing date (December 31 st ) unless there is a triggering event present during an interim period.
k)   Property and equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Asset
Life
Machinery and equipment
3
-
10
years
Computer equipment and software

-
5

Furniture and fixtures

Leasehold improvements
Over the lease period
Land improvements
Over the lease period
l)   Right-of-use asset
The Company's right-of-use assets consist of leased assets recognized in accordance with ASC 842,
Leases
which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represents the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company determines the lease term by agreement with lessor. In cases where the lease does not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.

For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
m)   Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist of trademarks, intellectual property, customer base and non-competes (Note 4). Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses per the table below:
Intangible asset
Life
Tradename - Trademarks
5 years
Non-competes
5 years
Intellectual Property
5 years
Customer Base
15 years
Other intangible assets
Over life of asset
The intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. The next assessment of useful lives is currently being performed as at December 31, 2022.
n)   Business Combination and Contingent consideration
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which control over one or more businesses is obtained. A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs that provide a return to the Company and its shareholders. A business need not include all of the inputs and processes that were used by the acquiree to produce outputs if the business can be integrated with the inputs and processes of the Company to continue to produce outputs. The Company considers several factors to determine whether the set of activities and assets is a business.
Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method whereby acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition with the excess of the purchase consideration over such fair value being recorded as goodwill and allocated to reporting units. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized immediately as a gain in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisition related costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred, except for the cost of debt or equity instruments issued in relation to the acquisition which is included in the carrying amount of the related instrument. Certain fair values may be estimated at the acquisition date pending confirmation or completion of the valuation process. Where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination, they are adjusted retrospectively in subsequent periods. However, the measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
The determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.

(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
o) Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,
Compensation-Stock Compensation . FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
p) Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted the ASC 260-10 which provides for calculation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and Class A shares outstanding for the period. Except for voting rights, the Company's common stock and Class A shares have the same dividend rights, are equal in all respects, and are otherwise treated as if they were one class of shares, including the treatment for the earnings per share calculations. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of November 30, 2022.
q) Foreign Currency Transactions and Comprehensive Income
U.S. GAAP generally requires recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however, require entities to report specific changes in assets and liabilities, such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation, as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company's subsidiaries is the US dollar. Translation gains (losses) are classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders' equity section of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.
r) Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes , which requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has not changed it methodology for estimating the valuation allowance. A change in valuation allowance affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made and could be significant due to the large valuation allowance currently established.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is 'more likely than not' that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the 'more likely than not' test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.

(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
s) Share purchase warrants
The Company accounts for the share purchase warrants issued to investor and brokers pursuant to equity financing as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the warrants and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
and ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging . The assessment considers whether the Warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company's own shares and whether the holders of the warrants could potentially require "net cash settlement" in a circumstance outside of the Company's control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent reporting period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued investor warrants and broker warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued investor warrants and broker warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, liability-classified warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of such warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.
For the period ended November 30, 2022, the Company concluded based on the above mentioned that the issued investor warrants and broker warrants met the criteria for equity classification in accordance with ASC 815-40 and therefore were classified under equity. The fair value of those warrants is determined by using Black Scholes valuation model on the date of issuance. Relative fair value method is applied to allocate gross proceeds from equity financing into its shares and warrants portion respectively. Those costs directly contributable to equity financing are accounted for as a reduction under stockholders' equity.
t) Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.
u)   Recently issued pronouncements
In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04 that requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding supplier finance programs intended to help investors better consider the effect of these programs on a company's working capital, liquidity, and cash flows over time. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods, except for the disclosure. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its disclosures in future unaudited interim condensed consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity  Securities Subject  to  Contractual  Sale  Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”), which (1) clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. Under current guidance, stakeholders have observed diversity in practice related to whether contractual sale restrictions should be considered in the measurement of the fair value of equity securities that are subject to such restrictions. On the basis of interpretations of existing guidance and the current illustrative example in ASC 820-10-55-52 of a restriction on the sale of an equity instrument, some entities use a discount for contractual sale restrictions when measuring fair value, while others view the application of such a discount to be inconsistent with the principles of ASC 820. To reduce the diversity in practice and increase the comparability of reported financial information, ASU 2022-03 clarifies this guidance and amends the illustrative example. ASU No. 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is in the process of determining the impact the adoption will have on its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as well as whether to early adopt the new guidance.
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in ASC Topic 310 and amends the guidance on "vintage disclosures" to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. ASU 2022-02 also updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC Topic 326 and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan re-financings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU, but do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

SALONA GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021
(In Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise stated)
In October 2021 FASB, issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations
(Topic 805),
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard. However, it did not have a material impact on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets. Under the new guidance, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The new guidance also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2023, as amended by ASU No. 2019-10, and interim periods within those periods, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the impact the adoption will have on its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as well as whether to early adopt the new guidance.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which amends ASC 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740). This update is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application of ASC 740. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance in this update has various elements, some of which are applied on a prospective basis and others on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In May 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40): Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This update provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for debt with conversion options, revises the criteria for applying the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity, and improves the consistency for the calculation of earnings per share. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 providing optional expedients and exceptions to account for the effects of reference rate reform to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The optional guidance, which became effective on March 12, 2020, could be applied through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued No 2022-06 extending the sunset date of the relief provided under ASU No. 2020-04 to December 31, 2024. The ASU has not impacted the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has various contracts that reference LIBOR and is assessing how this standard may be applied to specific contract modifications through December 31, 2024.
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.
4.   Acquisitions
South Dakota Partners Inc. ("SDP") Purchase Price

As of May 31, 2022, SDP has concluded its earn-out period and has met both the revenue and adjusted net asset threshold requirements to receive its full
19,162,000
non-voting "Class A" shares of common stock. As such, this obligation has been removed from the liability section of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as a contingent liability (as shown on the February 28, 2022, Consolidated Balance Sheet) and has been moved to the equity section as Share Capital. Please refer to the "Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity" for more detail regarding this reclassification. As of May 31, 2022, the date of issuance, the fair value of the
19,162,000
shares was $ 14,371,500
(fair value as of February 28, 2022, was $ 11,919,900 ), of which
143,000
were issued at a value of $ 107,250 .  The change in fair value of $ 2,451,600
has been reflected as an expense on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Assets Acquired from ALG-Health, LLC:
On November 29, 2021, the Company consummated the acquisition of the customer lists, sales orders and supply agreements and related sales channel and intellectual property assets of ALG-Health, LLC ("ALG"), a business engaged in the selling medical devices and supplies to small, independent hospitals, group purchasing organizations, medical offices and clinics, in exchange for non-voting securities of Health Plus which are exchangeable for up to a maximum of
21,000,000
nonvoting Class A shares of the Company subject to the achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets. In connection with the transaction, our subsidiary ALG Health Plus entered into an exclusive supply agreement with ALG.
The contingent consideration liability represents potential future earnout payments to the Company that are contingent on Health Plus's and ALG's business arrangement achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability on November 29, 2021 and February 28, 2022, was estimated to be nil and as such, no contingent liability was recorded on the date of the agreement was executed. As of November 30, 2022, as a result of new arrangements, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability is estimated to be $ 298,183 .
On November 21, 2022,

On February 28, 2022, the Company updated its assessment of the fair value of goodwill from the Simbex LLC acquisition, in conjunction with the Company's third-party valuation experts based on updated year to date results of the acquired entity, intangible assets, and other factors resulting in an impairment to goodwill of $ 5,520,522 . The fair value of goodwill was calculated by estimating the present value of future cash flows adjusted for redundant assets, working capital, and cost of disposal. The impairment of goodwill and adjustments to contingent consideration represent management's best estimates. Contingent consideration remains an estimate until the consideration is paid in line with the previously published purchase agreements relating to the Company's acquisitions. Goodwill represents an estimate of future value of the business based on acquisition data and always represents management's best estimate due to the variable nature of future performance

On September 23, 2022, the Company acquired DaMar Plastics Manufacturing Inc. ("DaMar"), a business engaged in designing, producing and selling specialty plastics in several markets including the medical device market. With over 50 years in business, DaMar currently provides the medical and consumer industries with precision plastic molding technology.

On December 15, 2022, the Company announced its intention to focus on listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq") in 2023. As a first step, the Company has changed its fiscal year end to December 31, 2022, with the aim of preparing for a U.S. listing.
Additionally, the Company's management team has a pipeline of small, privately held, stand-alone and bolt-on medical device companies targeted for acquisition in the highly fragmented global market for injury, surgical prevention, rehabilitation and recovery for the aging population throughout the continuum of care, which fall into one of three primary categories:
•   Private smaller medical device companies struggling with sufficient capitalization and operational expertise to fully realize the value of their intellectual property;
•   Niche players that succeed in developing a handful of quality products often turn to larger listed companies that do not allow ownership to participate in the upside of including their device in a larger company; and
•   Smaller U.S.-listed companies that lack liquidity and coverage to offer sufficient upside to vendors.
The Company believes it is the well positioned to offer acquisition targets upside through stock and cash acquisitions with a liquid TSXV listing.
The Company intends to acquire any identified medical device targets using a structure similar to its prior acquisitions. It is intended that potential targets would primarily or solely receive Company equity as consideration for the potential acquisition rather than cash, which would reduce its requirement for additional capital. Additionally, to date, discussions are most advanced with targets that are operationally cash flow positive, which may enhance the Company's ability to borrow for additional capital needs.
Selected Financial Information
The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated below, to assess the financial health of its acquisitions and determine the overall potential of its business not including transaction costs and other activities associated with the ongoing growth strategy of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net loss less interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign exchange gain, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and transaction costs.

labor costs expended in the production of medical devices, and related expenses allocated directly to the production of medical devices, and its cost of actual materials used in the production process from March 1, 2022, through November 30, 2022. Cost of revenue also includes the purchase of trading goods and costs associated with contract service revenue. The ongoing issues with the global supply chain process caused by COVID-19 and other economic factors has impacted the Company's ability to source affordable components. While there can be no assurances, management believes that the negative impacts on the Company's sourcing of components will diminish as the global supply chain stabilizes.

Amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of intangible assets such as trademarks, non-compete agreement, intellectual property, and customer base. The Company depreciates property and equipment across their useful lives. While there can be no assurances, the Company expects depreciation of property and equipment and of right of use asset and interest expense to increase as the Company continues to grow its balance sheet through acquisitions.
The change in fair value of earnout consideration represents the increase in fair value of SDP’s 19,162,000 earnout shares on May 31, 2022, the date of issuance. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration represents the obligations resulting from the Simbex, Health Plus, DaMar, and Mio-Guard acquisitions.  The company assesses its potential obligations related to these commitments during the quarter and fair values them accordingly.
Transaction costs include legal, financial, audit, US and Canadian regulatory expenses and other fees incurred in connection with the Change of Business transaction, the SDP, Simbex, Mio-Guard, DaMar and ALG acquisitions, due diligence of acquisition targets, financing costs, US regulatory costs, and associated accounting and other costs. While these costs are necessary, they are not operational expenses of the business.

Since the Company operates in the United States, it is exposed to foreign currency risk. Management is unable to effectively predict swings in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. Dollar against the Canadian Dollar. When currency is moved between denominations, a gain or loss may be realized which management is unable to accurately predict.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company does not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes and currently does not have any investments in marketable securities, which would expose it to market risks.
Interest Rate Risk
As part of its ongoing operations, the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings. See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long Term Debt". As of November 30, 2022, the Company has two variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of the Company's revolving loan facility is equal to the 4% or prime plus 0.75% per annum, and the interest rate of the Company's secured promissory note is equal to the greater of 6% or prime rate plus 2.75% per annum.
39
There is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over the Company's next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on its operations.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Company receives and makes payments in U.S. currency and accordingly is subject to the financial risks associated with changes in the exchange rate between U.S. currency and Canadian currency. The Company has not entered into any hedge arrangements intending to mitigate this exchange rate risk, and there is no assurance that the exchange rates will not fluctuate over the next fiscal year or that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.
